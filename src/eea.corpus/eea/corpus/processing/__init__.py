    A pipeline component is two pieces:

    * a ``process(content, **kwargs)`` function that performs any needed
    transformation on the input content.
    * a schema that will provide the necessary parameters values for the
    ``register`` function call

    Additionally, an ``actions`` mapping can be passed, where the keys are
    button names and the values are functions that will handle requests. They
    can be used to handle special cases that can't be foreseen by the main form
    views.

    Use such as:

        class SomeSettingsSchema(colander.Schema):
            count = colander.SchemaNode(colander.Int)

    # use), the decorator will start doing what's inside the callback.

    # For the simplified decorator, we just embellish the schema with the
    # required machinery fields, then act as a pass through for the original
    # function

    # a "hidden" class seems overkill, but also we don't want to modify, "in
