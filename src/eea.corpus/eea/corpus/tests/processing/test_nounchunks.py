TEXT = """assessment-2 Use of freshwater resources In general, renewable water
is abundant in Europe. However, signals from long-term climate and hydrological
assessments, including on population dynamics, indicate that there was a 24
% decrease in renewable water resources per capita across Europe between 1960
and 2010, particularly in southern Europe. The densely populated river basins
in different parts of Europe, which correspond to 11 % of the total area of
