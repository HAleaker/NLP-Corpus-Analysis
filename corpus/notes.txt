Ideas on what to improve and do next:

1. DONE Add full body of pages / content types in csv file

2. DONE Better tokenizier and pre-processing.

3. DONE strip html code from text with beautifulsoup4

4. DONE Install phrasemachine

#install pip2.7
curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
sudo python2.7 get-pip.py
pip2 install phrasemachine

#Or better convert to python3
https://github.com/slanglab/phrasemachine/issues/9
2to3 -w example.py

cd /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/phrasemachine
2to3 -w *.py

5. when tokenizing with phrasemachine, do it on one sentence at the time and
not over a large text. Otherwise you get too many phrases and false positives
