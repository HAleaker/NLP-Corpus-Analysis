"assessment-2  Use of freshwater resources     In general, renewable water is abundant in Europe. However, signals from long-term climate and hydrological assessments, including on population dynamics, indicate that there was a 24 % decrease in renewable water resources per capita across Europe between 1960 and 2010, particularly in southern Europe.   The densely populated river basins in different parts of Europe, which correspond to 11 % of the total area of Europe, continue to be hotspots for water stress conditions, and, in the summer of 2014, there were 86 million inhabitants inthese areas.   Around 40 % of the inhabitants in the Mediterranean region lived under water stress conditions in the summer of 2014.   Groundwater resources and rivers continue to be affected by overexploitation in many parts of Europe, especially in the western and eastern European basins.   A positive development is that water abstraction decreased by around 7 %between 2002 and 2014.   Agriculture is still the main pressure on renewable water resources. In the spring of 2014, this sector used 66 % of the total water used in Europe. Around 80 % of total water abstraction for agriculture occurred in the Mediterranean region. The total irrigated area in southern Europe increased by 12 % between 2002 and 2014, but the total harvested agricultural production decreased by 36 % in the same period in this region.   On average, water supply for households per capita is around 102 L/person per day in Europe, which means that there is 'no water stress'. However, water scarcity conditions created by population growth and urbanisation, including tourism, have particularly affected small Mediterranean islands and highly populated areas in recent years.   Because of the huge volumes of water abstracted for hydropower and cooling, the hydromorphology and natural hydrological regimes of rivers and lakes continue to be altered.   The targets set in the water scarcity roadmap, as well as the key objectives of the Seventh Environment Action Programme in the context of water quantity, were not achieved in Europe for the years 20022014.

"noise-pollution-in-the-spotlight  Noise pollution in the spotlight  In April, the European Environment Agency will help raise awareness of the growing problem of noise pollution across Europe. We discussed with Colin Nugent, an EEA noise pollution expert, the very real health impacts of noise which are often underestimated.    Why is noise pollution so important?    If you were to talk to most experts about pollution they tend to point to air pollution, water or waste. Noise tends to be one of the forgotten pollutants. However, if you look at environmental surveys, you see that citizens bring it up. People can connect much more to noise as a pollutant because invariably almost everyone has experienced a noise problem. Although they may not be fully aware of the health impacts, they can hear it very clearly and they know they are annoyed by it. Exposure to noise generally raises your stress levels, it raises your ‘fight-or-flight’ instinct in terms of threatening noises like aircraft, or very busy highways near your home. If you are subjected to those noise levels on a long term basis, as many urban dwellers in Europe are, it has an impact. The hyper tension and stress caused by exposure to noise can cause cardiovascular disease, stroke and ultimately mortality. So without realising it, the health impacts of noise are very real. Considering how many people live in cities in Europe and how our cities are expanding and how our demand for transport, mobility, extra flights, is also growing, noise is becoming a major issue for all of us.   What are the top three noise emitters in Europe?   If you ask an average citizen on the street, they will tell you it’s his or her next door neighbour’s dog, or the neighbour’s party on the weekend — a direct annoyance which effects your quality of life. People might not be completely aware that there is a major highway near their house; they hear it all the time, but they get used to it – it is background noise. But when we are looking at larger European Environment Agency assessments, the top emitter is our road transport network, followed by railways and aircraft noise. Aircraft noise tends to have more detrimental health effects than the others. However, the numbers of people exposed to aircraft are a good deal lower than they are for road traffic, because the road transport network is widespread, while airports are concentrated. Railway noise is also an issue but it tends to be more concentrated as well, and it can be easier to tackle. It’s not the same in case of road transport. There are so many vehicles, maintenance is up to the owner and there are so many different standards in terms of vehicles.   What has the European Union done to address the problem?   The EU has a very challenging target in the 7 th  Environment Action Programme - that is to significantly reduce noise pollution by 2020. It also aims to draw closer to the World Health Organization standards, because there are considerable differences. The EU also has a significant amount of legislation in place, including the Environmental Noise Directive, which requires assessments done by noise mapping and action plans to be drawn up. This directive is designed to inform other pieces of legislation covering emissions from road vehicles, trucks, trains, and aircraft. The directive also sets a number of noise indicators to be applied in noise mapping. These indicators represent a physical scale for the description of environmental noise. The two most important are the day-evening-night indicator, designed to assess annoyance, and the night-level indicator (Lnight) which is designed to assess sleep disturbance. These indicators are to be applied to mapping exposure assessments beginning at 55 decibels (dB) for day exposure and 50 dB for night exposure.   What is the EEA doing in assessing noise pollution?    We use the data gathered from mapping to publish regular assessments. Our reports are designed to inform policy makers and to raise awareness of the problem. To mark this year’s International Noise Awareness Day (26 April), we will publish a briefing with updated data on noise levels across Europe. The  last report was published in 2014 . This year is quite a big year for noise. The European Commission has decided to make this one if its key awareness raising initiatives for the year, to make Europeans aware of the problem of noise, what’s being done and what needs to be done still to improve the acoustic environment in Europe. Our upcoming briefing coincides with the Noise in Europe conference in Brussels on 24 April, where our Executive Director will present our latest findings. Although we are getting new information all the time, we still have gaps in the data. The more complete data we have, the more we can improve our knowledge of the problem, and policy makers will be better informed to take better action.   What can citizens do to reduce exposure to noise?   We can certainly look at changing the way we do things, take for example electric vehicles. They give a very immediate benefit, not only for air quality but also for noise emissions. They are very quiet vehicles. When you drive on city streets, you are driving at such low speeds generally, that electric cars give a very real benefit in terms of reduced noise emissions. Europe also has a labelling system for road tyres. It informs the consumer not only about the energy efficiency of the tyre, its safety, but also about the noise emission of the tyre. So consumers can choose quieter tyres. There is also the ‘Quiet mark’ labelling scheme where consumers can choose to buy fridges and other appliances, or lawn mowers that have the quiet labels, for example.

"what-does-nature-mean-to  What does nature mean to you?  NATURE@work photo competition launched  Nature works hard to protect us and to sustain our everyday lives — a fact that is often under-appreciated. But it plays a vital role, providing clean air, clean drinking water, clothing, food and raw materials we use to build shelter. Other benefits are not so well known, such as the role nature plays in alleviating the effects of climate change. To highlight the important role nature plays in our lives, the European Environment Agency (EEA) invites you to participate in capturing how nature benefits you through the ‘NATURE@work’ photography competition.   The EEA’s annual photo competition aims to engage with Europeans around different environmental issues and this year’s competition focuses on the benefits we receive from nature. Did you know that green spaces in and around our cities help protect our homes from flooding by absorbing excess flood water, or that trees and urban parks help lower temperatures in urban areas during heatwaves? With its intrinsic beauty and rich diversity, nature is also a source of inspiration not only for art but also for designing machines, homes and many innovation solutions.    The European Union has been committed to protecting nature and biodiversity since the 1970s . This year marks the 25 th  anniversary of the adoption of one of the key nature protection laws in the EU, the Habitats Directive. With this legislation, the EU has built the largest coordinated network of protected areas in the world through Natura 2000, which covers 18% of the EU’s land area and more than 6% of its seas territories. These efforts are supported by LIFE, the EU’s financial instrument for environmental, nature conservation and climate action projects.  The EU is also active in finding nature-based solutions to support economic growth, create jobs and enhance our well-being .   The ‘NATURE@work’ photo competition is open to all European citizens over the age of 18 and invites them to submit photographs that illustrate any of the following three themes:     NATUREprovides: Can you capture in a photo the benefits nature makes available that you cherish most?   NATUREprotects: Have you noticed how the nature around you – in the countryside, your town or city, protects you?   NATUREinspires: Can you spot anything around you that was inspired by nature?      The winners in each category above will be awarded a cash prize. All entries may be promoted by the EEA and its partners across Europe. You can submit your photos until 15 August.

"effective-policies-are-based-on  Effective policies are based on a robust knowledge base and solid science  At all governance levels, public policy making entails making decisions between different options and approaches. Some decisions, such as to invest in fossil fuels or renewables, might involve selecting one option over the other. Others might address the ‘how’ question – we will invest in renewables but which ones are the best for the society? Each policy decision results in outcomes, some of which might be unforeseen, unexpected or even detrimental to those whose lives it is supposed to improve. In the long term, the overall harm can be much larger than gains in the short term. To achieve the positive and lasting results on the ground, policy makers need to be able to make informed decisions, after assessing the benefits and costs of each available option.   An effective policy almost always relies on science. Similarly, measuring the effectiveness of a policy decision requires targets, which in turn entail a mechanism to monitor progress over time. Target setting and progress reporting also rely on scientific methods and evidence. These approaches are embedded throughout the European Union’s environment and climate policies.      The EU’s air quality policies, for example, aim to reduce the harm caused by various air pollutants and pollution sources. Long-term exposure to even low doses of air pollution constitutes a health risk, affecting us all at varying degrees. Medical science has long confirmed the links between poor air quality and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, impacting the young and the elderly in particular.   Science can identify causes and solutions   To monitor EU air pollution, Member States have set up more than 2 000 monitoring stations, regularly reporting the concentrations of various air pollutants in city centres, on roadsides or in rural areas. All this data is measured and processed in a way that is coherent across the EU and comparable over time. This reporting infrastructure allows policy makers to understand where and why there are pollution exceedances and helps inform what they can do to tackle it. Air quality modelling, informed by best science, is instrumental in identifying cause and effect relations, such as the number of diesel cars or coal-fired power plants and their impacts on urban air quality. This type of understanding is essential for designing appropriate policy responses and solutions.    At the local level, many cities have taken specific action to improve air quality. For example, the mayors of Paris, Madrid and Athens have proposed measures to ban diesel cars and vans from city centres by 2025 to improve air quality and reduce the associated damage to human health. Other cities struggling with repeated air pollution episodes are having to consider similar actions.     Trends can trigger action    In other cases, science-based evidence does not need to be time and location specific to provide reliable information, highly relevant to policy decisions. Informed policy decisions do not always need to be taken on the basis of complex spreadsheets listing hourly ozone readings at every monitoring station. Trend lines can equally strongly convey the message that action must be taken to reduce air pollution and its health impacts. Even with gaps in data, environmental and climate trends can send out a strong and convincing call for policy action.     Although the scope of climate science, including the multiple impacts of climate change, is very broad and deals with a level of complexity, non-linear relations, tipping points and thus a number of uncertainties, its central findings are quite clear: our planet is warming and our dependence on fossil fuels contributes to this warming. We also know that certain regions, not only across the globe but also in Europe, will be more affected by the adverse impacts of climate change than others. These findings have triggered many ambitious policies both at EU and global levels, including the EU’s climate and energy targets for 2030 and the Paris Agreement under the United Nations umbrella.     In fact, uncertainty and data gaps do not undermine the validity of scientific conclusions. They are an integral part of science and are clearly acknowledged in assessments. By acknowledging potential weaknesses, scientific knowledge evolves continuously, improving its methods, models and analysis.     Improvements in scientific knowledge and progress reporting towards a policy target can lead to policy improvements, such as adjustments to testing methods of carbon dioxide emissions from cars and vans or setting more rigorous climate and energy targets for 2030.     Our core work at the European Environment Agency deals directly with conveying scientific knowledge to policy makers and the public. We are a knowledge institution at the centre of an extensive network ( European Environment Information and Observation Network ), bringing together experts from national institutions and other bodies across 39 European countries. The EEA provides independent and reliable information on a wide range of topics linked to Europe’s environment and climate.

"assessment-2  Production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances   A significant reduction in the consumption of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) has been achieved by the EEA-33 countries since 1986. This reduction has been largely driven by the 1987 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Montreal Protocol.   Upon entry into force of the Montreal Protocol, EEA-33 consumption was approximately 420 000 ozone-depleting potential tonnes (ODP tonnes). Consumption values around zero were reached in 2002 and have remained consistently so ever since. S ince the early 1990s, th  e European Union (EU) has taken additional measures, in the shape of  EU law,  to reduce the consumption of ODS. In many aspects, the current EU regulation on substances that deplete the ozone layer (1005/2009/EC) goes further than the Montreal Protocol and it has also brought forward the phasing out of   hydrochlorofluorocarbons   (HCFCs) in the EU.    csi climate change air ozone air emissions ozone air pollution ozone depleting substances       CSI CSI006 CLIM CLIM049 006 049"
"cities-taking-action-learning-from  Cities taking action, learning from each other to adapt to climate change  Despite budgetary challenges, cities and towns across Europe are taking action to put in place measures that will help them adapt to the impacts of climate change. A new European Environment Agency (EEA) report released today highlights the opportunities open to municipalities to share best practices and how they can support projects like green roofs or expanding city parks to help alleviate the negative effects of climate change.   The EEA report  Financing urban adaptation to climate change, takes a closer look at innovative funding options now being used, such as green bonds and crowdfunding, alongside traditional funding channels. The report includes case studies that analyse how 11 cities across Europe are developing, funding and implementing urban adaptation measures. The case studies outline various projects that will help cities better protect themselves from the damage caused by extreme weather events. These include building more green spaces and installing green roofs, which enhance water retention and provide cooling as well as thermal insulation.   The publication is meant to serve as a resource for adaptation financing providers and project developers from international, national or regional public bodies and private institutions. The report also includes a helpful annex providing an overview of European-level financing options available to municipalities.   Innovative funding options   The costs needed to adapt cities to the effects of climate change vary but can run into millions of euros. The lack of funding has been cited by mayors, city managers and planners as one of the main reasons for the slow uptake of adaptation. Public funds for adaptation measures can be difficult to find in wake of other budgetary priorities. At the same time, many European cities and towns are facing significant investment needs to replace old infrastructure for basic services (such as sewer systems), buildings and transport over the next decade. Integrating climate adaptation requirements into such investments would save money in the long term, the report argues.   Municipalities across Europe have found different ways to finance adaptation. These range from tapping into public funds to more innovative financing mechanisms, including crowdfunding and green bonds. Green infrastructure measures with multiple benefits, such as nature conservation, recreation and quality of life, are receiving increased attention. Demonstrating multiple benefits of such measures can increase the chance of securing funds.   Cities are also organising themselves to share best practices and promote environmental cooperation through the  Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy  and other similar organisations.   The European Union has earmarked at least 20 percent of all its expenditures during the 2014-2020 budget period for climate change action  for mitigation and adaptation. Further national and regional financial streams are also available. However, the funds available through the EU and national and regional authorities meet only a small part of the investment needed. Public investment can act as seed money unlocking additional major private investment of a different type and scale.   The 11 case studies involve the following cities: Amsterdam, Bilbao, Bologna, Bratislava, Copenhagen, Ghent, Hamburg, Lisbon, Malm, Paris, and Smolyan.

"assessment  Population exposure to environmental noise     Noise pollution is a major environmental health problem in Europe.   Road traffic is the mostwidespread source of environmental noise, with an estimated 120 million people affected by harmful levels. Noise from railways, airports and industry are also important sources of noise.   The European Union's (EU) Seventh Environment Action Programme sets the objective that by 2020 noise pollution in the EU has significantly decreased, moving closer to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended levels.     noise exposure noise  TERM TERM005 CSI CSI051 005 051,This indicatorprovides an overview of the estimated number of people exposed to levels of environmental noise in Europe that are above the noise indicator levels set by the EU Environmental Noise Directive (2002/49/EC) within and outside urban areas. The major source of noise pollution both inside and outside urban areas is road traffic. Noise from railways and aircraft has a much lower impact in terms of overall population noise exposure, but both remain important sources of localised noise pollution. It is estimated that more than 120 million people in the EU are exposed to Lden noise levels (annual average day, evening and night period of exposure) from road traffic that are above 55dB. Night-time road traffic is another major source of noise exposure, with over 83 million Europeans being exposed to harmful Lnight levels above 50dB. In addition, many people are also exposed to rail, aircraft and industrial noise, particularly in towns and cities.More general impacts of exposure to harmful levels of environmental noise includeannoyance, stress reactions, sleep disturbance and an increase in the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease which can lead to premature death. While aircraft noise does not affect a wide geographical area, its documented harmful effects extend beyond health impacts on nearby populations to also impairing the ability of younger generations to concentrate in schools that are affected by aircraft flight paths."

At mid-latitudes no significant changes in annual precipitation have been observed. Mean summer precipitation has significantly decreased by up to 20mm per decade in most of southern Europe, while significant increases of up to 18mm per decade have been recorded in parts of northern Europe.   Projected changes in precipitation vary substantially across regions and seasons. Annual precipitation is generally projected to increase in northern Europe and to decrease in southern Europe. The projected decrease in southern Europe is strongest in the summer.     scenarios climate change key climate variables precipitation temperature     CLIM CLIM002 002,Past trends According to the E-OBS dataset [i], average annual precipitation across Europe shows no significant changes since 1960. However, significant changes have been observed at sub-continental scales. Most precipitation studies show a tendency towards wetter conditions in the Northern Hemisphere throughout the 20th century, but the changes are less spatially coherent than temperature change. The majority of Scandinavia and the Baltic states have observed an increase in annual precipitation of greater than 17mm per decade, which is as high as 70mm per decade in western Norway (Figure 1, left panel). Winter precipitation (December to February) tends to decrease in limited areas in southern Europe, and significant increases (up to 70mm per decade) have been recorded in most of northern Europe [ii]. In contrast, annual precipitation has decreased by up to 90mm per decade in the Iberian Peninsula, in particular in central Portugal. Mean summer (June to August) precipitation has significantly decreased by up to 20mm per decade in most of southern Europe, while significant increases (up to 18mm per decade) have been recorded in parts of northern Europe (Figure 1, right panel) [iii]. Changes in large-scale circulation patterns (synoptic atmospheric circulation) play a key role in the observed changes in precipitation [iv]. It is not clear if the relatively minor land-use changes in Europe since the 1950s have influenced observed precipitation trends [v]. Projections For a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), the models (ensemble mean) project a statistically significant increase in annual precipitation in large parts of central and northern Europe (of up to about 30%) and a decrease in southern Europe (of up to 40%) from 19712000 to 20712100 (Figure 2 left panel); in summer, the precipitation decrease extends northwards (Figure 2 right panel) [vi]. A zone with small changes that are not significant (but are, however, partially robust in the direction of the change), shows where the precipitation pattern (as presented in the ensemble mean) changes the direction of the change. For a medium emissions scenario (RCP4.5), the magnitude of change is smaller, but the pattern is very similar to the pattern for the RCP8.5 scenario. The range of projected changes in precipitation from the multi-model ensemble are generally the same between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, or larger in RCP8.5, especially at the end of the century [vi].

"climate-change-poses-increasingly-severe  Climate change poses increasingly severe risks for ecosystems, human health and the economy in Europe  Europe’s regions are facing rising sea levels and more extreme weather, such as more frequent and more intense heatwaves, flooding, droughts and storms due to climate change, according to a European Environment Agency report published today. The report assesses the latest trends and projections on climate change and its impacts across Europe and finds that better and more flexible adaptation strategies, policies and measures will be crucial to lessen these impacts.   The observed changes in climate are already having wide-ranging impacts on ecosystems, the economy and on human health and well-being in Europe, according to the report ‘ Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe 2016 ’. New records continue to be set on global and European temperatures, sea levels and reduced sea ice in the Arctic. Precipitation patterns are changing, generally making wet regions in Europe wetter and dry regions drier. Glacier volume and snow cover are decreasing. At the same time, climate-related extremes such as heat waves, heavy precipitation and droughts, are increasing in frequency and intensity in many regions. Improved climate projections provide further evidence that climate-related extremes will increase in many European regions.   ‘Climate change will continue for many decades to come. The scale of future climate change and its impacts will depend on the effectiveness of implementing our global agreements to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but also ensuring that we have the right adaptation strategies and policies in place to reduce the risks from current and projected climate extremes,’ said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director.   Climate change hotspots   All European regions are vulnerable to climate change, but some regions will experience more negative impacts than others. Southern and south-eastern Europe is projected to be a climate change hotspot, as it is expected to face the highest number of adverse impacts. This region is already experiencing large increases in heat extremes and decreases in precipitation and river flows, which have heightened the risk of more severe droughts, lower crop yields, biodiversity loss and forest fires. More frequent heat waves and changes in the distribution of climate-sensitive infectious diseases are expected to increase risks to human health and well-being.   Coastal areas and floodplains in western parts of Europe are also seen as hotspots as they face an increased risk of flooding from rising sea levels and a possible increase in storm surges. Climate change is also leading to major changes in marine ecosystems as a result of ocean acidification, warming and the expansion of oxygen-depleted dead zones.   Ecosystems and human activities in the Arctic will also be strongly affected owing to the particularly rapid increase in air and sea temperatures and the associated melting of land and sea ice.   Although some regions may also experience some positive impacts, such as improving conditions for agriculture in parts of northern Europe, most regions and sectors will be negatively affected.   Map ES.1 Key observed and projected climate change and impacts for the main biogeographical regions in Europe           Source: EEA, 2017     Ecosystems, human health and economy   Ecosystems and protected areas across Europe are under pressure from climate change and other stressors, such as land use change. The report highlights that the impacts of climate change are a threat to biodiversity at land and in the seas. Many animal and plant species are experiencing changes to their life cycles and are migrating northwards and to higher altitudes, while various invasive species have established themselves or have expanded their range. Marine species, including commercially important fish stocks, are also migrating northwards. These changes affect various ecosystem services and economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry and fisheries.   The main health effects of climate change are linked to extreme weather events, changes in the distribution of climate-sensitive diseases, and changes in environmental and social conditions. River and coastal flooding has affected millions of people in Europe in the last decade. The health effects include injuries, infections, exposure to chemical hazards and mental health consequences. Heatwaves have become more frequent and intense, leading to tens of thousands of premature deaths in Europe. This trend is projected to increase and to intensify, unless appropriate adaptation measures are taken. The spread of tick species, the Asian tiger mosquito and other disease carriers increases the risk of Lyme disease, tick-borne encephalitis, West Nile fever, dengue, chikungunya and leishmaniasis.   The economic costs of climate change can be very high. Climate-related extreme events in EEA member countries account for more than EUR 400 billion of economic losses since 1980. Available estimates of the future costs of climate change in Europe consider only some sectors and show considerable uncertainty. Still, the projected damage costs from climate change are highest in the Mediterranean region. Europe is also affected by climate change impacts occurring outside Europe through trade effects, infrastructure, geopolitical and security risks, and migration.   Enhancing adaptation and knowledge   Mainstreaming of climate change adaptation into other policies is progressing but can be further enhanced. Other possible further actions include improving policy coherence across different policy areas and governance levels (EU, transnational, national and subnational), more flexible adaptive management approaches, and the combination of technological solutions, ecosystem-based approaches and ‘soft’ measures.   The development and use of climate and adaptation services are increasing in Europe. Improved knowledge would be useful in various areas, for example, on vulnerability and risk assessments at various scales and on monitoring, reporting and evaluation of adaptation actions, their costs and benefits, and synergies and trade-offs with other policies.   Background   The report is an indicator-based assessment of past and projected climate change and its impacts on ecosystems and society. It also looks at society’s vulnerability to these impacts and at the development of adaptation policies and the underlying knowledge base.   The report was developed by the EEA in collaboration with the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the World Health Organisation Regional Office for Europe and three European Topic Centres (ETC-CCA, ETC-BD, ETC-ICM). This is the fourth ‘Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe’ report, which is published every four years. This edition aims to support the implementation and review process of the 2013 EU Adaptation Strategy, which is foreseen for 2018, and the development of national and transnational adaptation strategies and plans.   climate change impacts climate change adaptation extreme temperatures weather and climate extremes damage extreme weather and climate climate change mitigation climate change and health threats to biodiversity precipitation extremes,The observed changes in climate are already having wide-ranging impacts on ecosystems, the economy and on human health and well-being in Europe, according to the report ‘Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe 2016’.

"assessment  Economic losses from climate-related extremes     The total reported economic losses caused by weather and climate-related extremes in the EEA member countries over the period 1980-2015 amount to around EUR 433 billion (in 2015 Euro values). The average annual economic losses have varied between EUR 7.5billion in the period 1980-1989, EUR 13.5 billion in the period 1990-1999, and EUR 14.3 billion in the period 2000-2009. In the period from 2010 to 2015 the average annual loss accounted to around EUR 13.3 billion.    The observed variations in reported economic loss over time are difficult to interpret since a large share of the total deflated losses has been caused by a small number of events. Specifically, more than 70 % of the economic losses was caused by only 3 % of all registered events.     natural hazards in eea weather and climate extremes damage weather damage natural catastrophes statistics natural disasters climate damage climate change       CSI CSI042 CLIM CLIM039 042 039,Past trends According to data from NatCatService of Munich Re [4]on natural disasters between 1980 and 2015 in the member countries of European Environment Agency (EEA), weather and climate-related extremes [1] accounted for 92% of total reported disaster events and around 83% of the total losses. Specifically, weather and climate related losses amounted to EUR 433 billion (at 2015 Euro values[2]), on average EUR12 billion per year, EUR 75 800 per square kilometre, or EUR 780 per capita[3]. Losses are equal to 0.1% of the cumulative deflated GDP over the analysed period, or nearly 3% of the GDP in 2015. Around 35% of the total losses were insured (Figure/Table 1). There were 89 873 casualties registered over the period. The assessment is based on the Munich Re dataset[4], and the Eurostat collection of economic indicators [5], whereas data from earlier years not covered by Eurostat have been completed from the Annual Macro-Economic Database of the European Commission (AMECO), the International Monetary Funds (IMF) World Economic Outlook (WEO), the Total Economy Database (TED) and the World Banks database. The distribution of weather and climate related losses among the thirty three EEA member countries is uneven. The highest overall economic losses in absolute terms were registered in Germany, Italy and United Kingdom (see Figure/Table 1). The highest losses per capita were recorded in Switzerland, Denmark, and Austria. The greatest shares of total losses in terms of cumulative GDP were registered in Croatia, Czech Republic, and Hungary. The three least affected countries in absolute terms were Liechtenstein, Iceland and Malta. In relative terms (per capita) the least affected countries include Turkey, Estonia and Latvia. In terms of loss as a share of cumulative GDP, the least affected countries include Liechtenstein, Iceland and Estonia. The largest 34 events caused about half of the recorded losses. The costliest climate extremes were the 2002 flood in Central Europe (almost EUR 20 billion), followed by the 2003 drought and heatwave (EUR 15 billion) and 1999 winter storm, Lothar (EUR 15 billion). One important question is to what extent the observed increase in overall losses during recent decades is attributable to changing climatic conditions rather than other factors. According to AR5 of the IPCC [i], increasing exposure of people and economic assets has been the major cause of long-term increases in economic losses from weather and climate-related disasters. Long-term trends in economic disaster losses, adjusted for wealth and population increases, have not been attributed to climate change, but a role for climate change has not been excluded. Available studies for economic losses from river floods and storms in Europe suggest that the observed increases in losses are primarily due to increases in populations, economic wealth and developments in hazard-prone areas, but the observed increase in heavy precipitation in parts of Europe may have also played a role[ii]. There is evidence that improved flood protection and prevention contributed to reducing losses over time in some cases[iii]. For the period between 1980 and 2015, the economic losses of all natural disasters in the EEA member countries amounted to EUR 520 billion and the insured losses were around EUR 154 billion (in 2015 values) (Figure 2). Around 64 % of all economic losses were due to meteorological and hydrological events, while most of fatalities were caused by heat waves. This large portion of fatalities is highly influenced by the heatwave of 2003, where around 70 000 fatalities were reported as excess mortality (Figure 2). Recorded economic losses from weather and climate related extremes in Europe have varied substantially over time. The average annual economic loss (inflation-corrected) was around EUR 7.5 billion per year in the 1980s (1980-1989), EUR 13.4 billion in the 1990s (1990-1999), EUR 14.3 billion per year in the 2000s (2000-2009). In the period 2010 to 2015 , the average annual economic loss accounted to around EUR 13.3 billion (Figure 3). However, the pattern that can be found in the recorded loss is obfuscated by high variability: around 3% of events, some of which affected more than one country, account for around 70% of total deflated loss. Conversely, some three quarters of the registered events were responsible for only half a percentage point of the total losses. The increased economic wealth has a major effect on the annual losses. Currently there is no mechanism in place for reporting the economical losses from weather and weather and climate-related events by the EU member states to the European Commission or the EEA. However activities are underway to improve national databases on disaster losses, coordinated by JRC IPSC[6]. Once comparable national databases are available for all EU member states and EEA member countries and these data would be reported in future, this EEA indicator can be based on such data instead of data from Munich Re. Projections The IPCCAR5 concludes that high temperature extremes, heavy precipitation events and droughts will markedly increase in all or most world regions, including in Europe. Furthermore, large parts of Europe will face an increasing drought risk [iv]. There is medium confidence in the fact that climate change will increase the likelihood of systemic failures across European countries as a result of extreme climate events affecting multiple sectors [v]. Increasing extremes will presumably lead to greater losses. However, the future cost of climate-related hazards in Europe will depend on several factors, including the resilience and vulnerability of society, which are variable across hazards and regions.   [1] The analysed hazards are classified by Munich Re in four categories: geophysical, meteorological, hydrological and climatological. For the purpose of this indicator weather and climate-related events are defined as the combination of meteorological, hydrological and climatological events in the Munich Re database.   [2] The exact estimate differ by several percentage points depending on choices made, including the price indices chosen for accounting for inflation, reference base (annual, monthly) for the conversion between losses expressed in USD and EUR, etc.   [3] Based on average population over the entire period 1980-2015.

"assessment-1  Final energy consumption by sector and fuel    Between 2005 and 2014, final energy consumption decreased by 11 % (1.3 % annually) in the EU-28. Final energy consumption decreased in all sectors, particularly in the industry and households sectors (16.5 % and 14.8 %, respectively), but also in the transport (4.5 %) and services sectors (1.7 %). This decrease in final energy consumption since 2005 was influenced by economic performance, structural changes in various end-use sectors, particularly industry, improvements in end-use efficiency and lower than average heat consumption as a result of favorable climatic conditions, particularly in 2011 and 2014. In 2014, the EU-28 met its 2020 target for final energy consumption.       Between 2005 and 2014, final energy consumption in some non-EU EEA countries, namely Turkey, Iceland and Norway, increased by 28 % (2.8 % per year). This difference was caused by an increase in energy consumption in Turkey (35 %) and Iceland (78 %), and a small decrease in energy consumption in Norway (1 %). Since 1990, the final energy consumption in these non-EU EEA countries has increased by 92 % (2.8 % annually).       Final energy consumption in the EEA-33 countries decreased by 8.4 % (1 % annually) between 2005 and 2014. The largest contributors to this decrease were the industry and household sectors, bothcontributing 13.6 % to this decrease. On average, each person in the EEA-33 countries used 2.0 tonnes of oil equivalent to meet their energy needs in 2014.    fuels energy consumption natural gas electricity ghg retrospective solid fuels energy cosumption electriciy energy         CSI CSI027 ENER ENER016 027 016, Between 2005 and 2014, final energy consumption decreased by 11 % (1.3 % annually) in the EU-28 (Figure 1) and by 8.4 % (1.0 % annually) in the EEA-33 countries. Between 2013 and 2014, final energy consumption decreased (see Table 1) by 4.1 % in the EU-28 and 3.5 % in the EEA-33 countries. The difference in the reduction in final energy consumption between the EEA-33 and the EU-28 is mainly as a result of the increase in energy consumption in Turkey (35 %) and Iceland (78 %) between 2005 and 2014. In Iceland, this increase was mainly caused by an increase in the production capacity of the aluminium industry. In Norway, final energy consumption decreased by 1 % between 2005 and 2014. With regard to final energy consumption per sector (see Figure 1), final energy consumption in the industry sector has decreased by 16.5 % in the EU-28 (13.6 % in the EEA-33) since 2005, in the household sector it has decreased by 14.8 % in the EU-28 (13.6 % in the EEA-33), in the transport sector it has decreased by 4.6 % in the EU-28 (1.6 % in the EEA-33), and in the 'Fishing, agriculture and forestry' and 'Non-specified' sectors it has decreased by 27.9 % in the EU-28 (22.5 % in the EEA-33). In the services sector, final energy consumption has decreased by 1.7 % in the EU-28 since 2005, but it has increased by 2.4 % in the EEA-33. Over the whole period (19902014), the largest increases in final energy consumption in the EU-28 occurred in the services and transport sectors, with increases of 30 % and 24 %, respectively (38 % and 28 %, respectively, in the EEA-33). Between 2005 and 2014, energy consumption in the industry sector fell at an average annual rate of 2.0 %. This was largely the result of a shift towards less energy-intensive manufacturing industries and the continuing transition to a more service-oriented European economy, combined with the effects of the economic recession in recent years. This trend in decreasing energy consumption in industry is expected to continue in the future because of ongoing industry reallocation which could lead to a permanently smaller manufacturing sector in the EU. Between 2005 and 2014, energy consumption in the services sector decreased annually by 0.2 %. This sector is growing in Europe and so is the demand for energy for electrical appliances, particularly those related to information and communication technologies, such as computers, and other energy-intensive technologies, such as heating and air conditioning. Overall, however, the energy consumption in this sector has been more or less stable. Between 2005 and 2014, energy consumption in the transport sector decreased annually by 0.5 %. This decrease, observed since 2007, was due to energy savings in road transport. This is the result of improvements in fuel efficiency, as a result of vehicle emission standards, which have been offset by increases in passenger and freight transport demand. Higher transport demand has resulted from an increase in the ownership of private cars, particularly in the new EU Member States, as well as an increase in settlement and urban sprawl which have led to people travelling longer distances, and changes in lifestyle. For more details on trends in the transport sector, see EEA, 2015a, and TERM001. In 2014, the transport sector accounted for 33 % of total final energy consumption in the EU-28 Member States, followed by the industrial sector (26 %), the household sector (25 %) and the services sector (13 %) (see Figure 1). The observed trend in final energy consumption differs significantly across the EEA member countries (see Table 1). Between 2005 and 2014, Iceland, Malta and Turkey experienced, by far, the largest increases in final energy consumption (78 %, 42 % and 35 %, respectively), whereas Greece and Spain experienced the largest decreases (26 % and 19 %, respectively). In addition, final energy consumption also decreased significantly in Hungary (18 %), Portugal (17 %), Italy (17 %), Ireland (15 %) and the United Kingdom (15 %) during this period. Large increases in final energy consumption correlate with growing economies (e.g. Turkey) and growing industry (e.g. Iceland). The decreases in final energy consumption are mainly the result of energy savings (in Ireland and the United Kingdom), in combination with a decrease in economic activity (Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain). Between 2005 and 2014, the consumption of oil decreased by 16.1 % (1.9 % annually) (see Figures 2 and 6). The largest decrease, of 45.1 %, was in the industry sector. The smallest decrease, of 7.8 %, occurred in the transport sector. Between 2005 and 2014, the final consumption of electricity decreased by 2.8 % (0.3 % annually) (see Figures 3 and 6). Since 2005, electricity consumption in the services sector continued to increase (by 10 %), while, over the same period, electricity consumption decreased by 12 % in the industry sector and 2 % in the household sector. Electricity consumption in industry decreased mainly because of a decrease in activity in the sector and an increase in energy savings. The consumption of electricity in the household sector has been more or less stable since 2005. An increase in the number of dwellings has been balanced by an increase in the energy efficiency of lighting, electrical appliances, and electrical heating and cooling systems. The increase in the consumption of electricity in the services sector is because of the Europe-wide growth of the sector. Between 2005 and 2014, the consumption of natural gas decreased by 18.6 % (2.3 % annually) (see Figures 4 and 6). Natural gas consumption in the households and services sectors has, on average, decreased as a result of improvements in the thermal performance of buildings, but this has been offset, to a certain extent, by an increase in the number of houses and buildings. Between 2005 and 2014, natural gas consumption decreasedby 22.1 % in the household sector and 5.3 % in the services sector. In 2014, the household sector accounted for the largest proportion of the final energy consumption of natural gas (42 %) in the EU-28. This was a result of the increase in the use of gas for residential heating and cooking. Consequently, the trend in natural gas consumption shows relatively large year-to-year variations due to weather conditions: natural gas consumption increased in 2010 because of cold winter conditions and decreased in 2011 and 2014because of mild winter conditions. Between 2005 and 2014, the consumption of solid fuels decreased by 13.7 % (1.6 % annually) (see Figures 5 and 6). In absolute terms, this reduction occurred mainly in the industry sector. The decrease of solid fuel consumption in the households sector stopped in 2000. However, year-to-year variations occur because of weather conditions. "
"energy-efficiency-and-specific-co2-9  Energy efficiency and specific CO2 emissions      Specific CO  2   emissions from the road transport sector have decreased since 2000, mainly because of past improvements in the fuel efficiency of passenger cars. An EU regulation sets emission performance standards for new passenger cars, which is expected to further reduce CO  2   emissions as a result of emission targets of 130 g/km and 95 g/km targets that it sets for 2015 and 2021, respectively. A separate regulationsetsemission standardsfor light commercial vehicles (vans), with a 2017 target of 175g CO 2 /km and147g CO 2 /km by 2020.     Although decreasing, the   CO  2   emissions from the air transport sector are still considerably higher than those from road transport, while rail remains the most energy efficient mode of passenger transport.     The specific energy efficiency of light and heavy duty trucks has improved slightly since 2000, but road transport still consumes significantly more energy per tonne-kilometre (tkm) than rail or ship freight transport. CO  2   emissions from light commercial vehicles are also expected to decrease in view of the   emission targets of   175 g/km and 147 g/km set for 2015 and 2020, respectively.      co2 greenhouse gas emissions cars transport indicators passenger transport freight transport co2 emissions passenger cars road transport transport term 027           TERM TERM027 027,Between 2000 and 2014, the specific CO2 emissions of the road transport sector decreased by 10.3 % for passenger transport and by 9 % for freight transport. The energy efficiency and CO2 per passenger-kilometre (pkm) of passenger cars improved by 10.4 % over the same period, somewhat as a result of an early (now discontinued) voluntary agreement made by the automotive manufacturing industries, but more significantly following the introduction of the EU regulation (No. 443/2009). The reductions in road freight transport are because of technical improvements in light- and heavy-duty trucks (mainly in engine efficiency) and the increased activity of heavy-duty trucks (i.e. higher load factors). Between 2000 and 2014, the combined effect of improvements in aircraft technology and increased load factors resulted in an overall decrease in the specific CO2 emissions from the air passenger transport sector of 17.9 %. Transport volumes and total emissions reached a peak in 2002 and have decreased slightly since then. Rail is by far the most energy efficient mode of passenger transport. The specific CO2 emissions from the rail transport sector have decreased by about 54 % from 2005 to 2014 for passenger transport and by about 27 % for freight transport, mainly because of a shift from diesel to electric trains.,In the EU-28, CO2 emissions from the new passenger car fleet fell from 123.4 g to 119.5 g between 2014 and 2015, a decrease of 3.9 g CO2/km. The new passenger car fleet met the emission target of 130 g CO2/km set for 2015 two years early, but additional efforts are still required to meet the future target of 95 g CO2/km by 2020.The average mass of new passenger cars registered in the EU-28 has returned to 2010/2011 levels. The average mass of new cars sold in the EU (i.e. 1 381 kg) remained broadly the same in 2015 as in 2014. However,new cars are becoming more efficient; the average car sold in 2015 was almost 15 % more efficient than the average car sold in 2010. The average van registered in 2015 emitted 168.3 g CO2/km, 0.9 g less than in 2014. While the reported annual reduction is small, emissions are nevertheless well below the EUs 2017 target of 175 g CO2/km. This target was already met in 2013. Vans are also becoming more efficient; the average van sold in 2015 was more than 6 % more efficient than the average van sold in 2012. Further efficiency improvements still need to be achieved to reach the EUs more stringent target of 147 g CO2/km set for 2020."
"assessment  Hail     Hail events are among the most costly weather-related extreme events in several European regions, causing substantial damage to crops, vehicles, buildings and other infrastructure.   The number of hail events is highest in mountainous areas and pre-Alpine regions. Since 1951, increasing hail trends have been noted in southern France and Austria, and decreasing (but not statistically significant) trends have been noted in parts of eastern Europe.   Future projections of hail events are subject to large uncertainties, because small-scale hail events cannot be directly represented in global and regional climate models. However, model-based studies for central Europe show some agreement that hailstorm frequency will increase in this region.     climate change key climate variables  CLIM CLIM053 053,Past trends Trends in days with hail have been calculated using surface-based observations, but are unreliable owing to the limited number of stations and the stochastic nature of hailstorms [i]. Trends in hail observations are sometimes analysed using reports of damage as a proxy (e.g. insurance claims), although damage is also a function of the vulnerability of the impacted area to damage. Several European regions show an increase in the convective conditions that can potentially form hail. In some areas (such as south-west Germany), an increase in damage days is observed [ii]. However, these changes are not uniform across Europe, with large regional differences mostly related to topography. A study of hailstorm frequencies over the period 19782009 in Germany and eastern Europe shows general increases in convective available potential energy (CAPE) and increases in evaporation, which have been attributed to rising temperatures, but the changes in these weather variables do not necessary modify the numbers and intensities of severe convective storms [iii]. The atmosphere has become more unstable, and thus more suitable for hail, especially in southern and central Europe, where the temperature increase in summer has been particularly large[iv]. Recently, European hail climatology for the period 19512010 was analysed using a combination of various meteorological parameters relevant for thunderstorms and hail[v]. This has been expressed as the potential hail index (PHI), which quantifies the atmospheric potential for hailstorms. The climatology shows the highest values of the mean PHI for the areas north and south of the Alps, the eastern Adriatic coast and parts of eastern Europe (Figure 1 left). Increasing hail trends (with a PHI over 3 in the period 19512010) are found in southern France and Spain, and decreasing trends (with a PHI lower than 5 in the period 19512010) in eastern Europe (Figure 1 right). However, trends are not significant (at the 5% significance level) in most grid boxes. Projections Much of the published work relevant to future hail projections is based upon developing the relationships between large-scale atmospheric environments and small-scale severe weather events, such as severe thunderstorms, hailstorms and tornadoes. Available projections suggest increases in CAPE, which result in conditions that favour severe thunderstorms becoming more frequent, and decreases in wind shear, which reduces the likelihood of hailstorms [vi]. Different RCMs have been used for assessing changes in hailstorms at the national and sub-national scales. A statistically significant downwards trend for hailstones with diameters between 21 and 50mm was projected for the United Kingdom [vii]. An increase in hailstorm frequency between 7 and 15% for the period 20312045 compared with 19712000 was projected for south-west Germany based on large-scale weather patterns [viii]. Using the PHI and an ensemble of seven RCMs, an increase in hail probability over most areas of Germany was projected for the period 20212050 compared with 19712000 [ix]. The projected changes are largest in southern Germany (values of almost 7 PHI). However, the results are subject to large uncertainties, mainly owing to low spatial resolution and convective parametrisation schemes in regional climate models [x]. Improving the convective parametrisation schemes and increasing the spatial resolution of models would improve the accuracy of future hail projections.   [i] H. J. Punge and M.

"assessment  Wind storms     Storm location, frequency and intensity have shown considerable decadal variability across Europe over the past century, such that no significant long-term trends are apparent.   Recent studies on changes in winter storm tracks generally project an extension eastwards of the North Atlantic storm track towards central Europe and the British Isles.   Climate change simulations show diverging projections on changes in the number of winter storms across Europe. However, most studies agree that the risk of severe winter storms, and possibly of severe autumn storms, will increase for the North Atlantic and northern, north-western and central Europe over the 21st century.     europe climate change projection wind speed    CLIM CLIM005 005,Past trends Studies of past changes in extra-tropical storms have used a variety of methods, making it difficult to compare the results of different studies or to assess if there is any underlying trend in climate change. Storm location and intensity in Europe has shown considerable variation over the past century, but Northern Hemisphere storm tracks and intensity have likely shifted northwards since at least 1970 [i]. Wind data at the local or regional levels can show a series of decreases and increases continuing over several decades. Long records of wind speed for various regions across Europe indicate that storm intensity (i.e. storminess) has not significantly changed over the past 200 years. Available studies of storminess in north-western Europe indicate relatively high levels during the 1880s, followed by below-average conditions between the 1930s and 1960s, a pronounced increase in storminess until the mid-1990s, and average or below-average activity afterwards. Somewhat similar patterns were observed in other parts of Europe [ii]. There is low confidence in the robustness of reanalysis results for extreme wind speeds before the middle of the 20th century [iii]. A single reanalysis study for the period 18712008 suggests an increasing trend in storminess across western, central and northern Europe, with storminess in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea region reaching its highest values towards the end of the 20th century [iv]. Other studies have produced evidence that both conflicts and agrees with this result [v]. Projections The simulation of extra-tropical cyclones in climate models remains a scientific challenge in spite of recent significant progress in modelling techniques. Earlier model studies showed shifts both polewards [vi] and towards the equator [vii] in the Atlantic storm track. The latter could double the predicted increase in winter rainfall over western and central Europe compared with other climate projections. Recent simulations based on CMIP5 data project an extension eastwards of the North Atlantic storm track towards central Europe and the British Isles [viii]. Modelling studies show diverging results on changes in the number of storms across Europe, but they generally agree on increases in the strongest, most damaging storms in most European regions. A study using a multi-model ensemble projects a small increase in the wind speed of the strongest winter storms over northern parts of central and western Europe, and a decrease in southern Europe (Figure 1) [ix]. The associated change in mean potential economic loss varied between 7% in the Iberian Peninsula and +25% in Germany. A comprehensive review study covering the North Atlantic and northern, north-western and central Europe shows large agreement that the intensity of winter storms will increase in all these regions over the 21st century [x]. Another recent study focusing on central Europe concluded that models consistently projected an increased frequency and intensity of severe storms over central Europe. Under SRES A1B conditions, increases in frequency towards the end of the 21st century range between 11% and +44%, with an ensemble average of 21% [xi]. The intensity of storms affecting central Europe once a year was found to increase by about +30%, with individual models projecting changes between 28% and up to +96%. These results are largely consistent with those of a recent study based on the GCM projections underlying the IPCCAR5 [xii]. One recent study with a single, very high-resolution (~25km) GCM indicates that the frequency and intensity in Europe of severe autumn storms originating in the tropical Atlantic will increase in a warmer future climate as will the area affected [xiii]. However, this result cannot be considered robust, as it has not yet been confirmed by other studies. In summary, the risk of severe winter storms, and possibly of severe autumn storms, is projected to increase in many regions in Europe, in particular for the North Atlantic and northern, north-western and central Europe.

"assessment  Heavy precipitation     The intensity of heavy precipitation events in summer and winter have increased in northern and north-eastern Europe since the 1960s. Different indices show diverging trends for south-western and southern Europe.   Heavy precipitation events are likely to become more frequent in most parts of Europe. The projected changes are strongest in Scandinavia and eastern Europe in winter.     climate change key climate variables heavy precipitation   CLIM CLIM004 004,Past trends The majority of observation-based studies that investigate trends in extreme rainfall intensity are based on data recorded at the daily time scale. An index for the maximum annual precipitation over five consecutive days (Rx5d) shows significant increases up to 5mm per decade over northern and north-western Europe in winters and up to 4mm in summers (Figure 1 left). The same index shows decreases of more than 5mm per decade in south-western Europe in winter and between 2 and 3mm in summer (Figure 1 right). The smaller trends in central and south-eastern Europe are not statistically significant. The increase in northern and north-eastern Europe is a consequence of the observed shift polewards of the North Atlantic storm track and weakening of Mediterranean storms [i]. A wider literature review suggests that heavy precipitation events have become more intense and more frequent in Europe on average, but there are important differences across regions, seasons, time periods, heavy precipitation indices and underlying datasets. Studies generally agree that heavy precipitation has become more intense in northern and north-eastern Europe since the 1950s, even though not all changes are statistically significant. Different studies and indices show diverging trends for south-western and southern Europe. Records of daily mean precipitation are often insufficient to study trends and changes in heavy precipitation. The damage associated with heavy precipitation often originates from sub-daily localised heavy precipitation events, which can lead to costly flash floods. Owing to limited data availability, only a limited number of studies have focused on large regional scale assessments of sub-daily precipitation [ii]. A recent review study concludes that extreme sub-daily precipitation events have generally increased in Europe, even in regions with decreases in mean rainfall, but there is large variability across regions, seasons and event durations [iii]. Projections Global warming is projected to lead to a higher intensity of precipitation and longer dry periods in Europe [iv]. Projections show an increase in heavy daily precipitation in most parts of Europe in winter, by up to 35% during the 21st century. Heavy precipitation in winter is projected to increase over most of Europe, with increases of up to 30% in north-eastern Europe (Figure 2 left). In summer, an increase is also projected in most parts of Europe, but decreases are projected for some regions in southern and south-western Europe (Figure 2 right) [v]. Similar patterns were found for other heavy precipitation indices [vi]. The continued increase in the spatial and temporal resolution of global and regional climate models has generally improved the representation of extreme precipitation and increased confidence in model-based projections [vii]. However, regional climate models with spatial resolutions of between 10 and 30km typically used in climate change studies are still too coarse to explicitly represent sub-daily localised heavy precipitation events [viii]. Evidence from high-resolution climate models suggests that the intensity of sub-daily extreme rainfall is likely to increase in the future, whereby an increase of (theoretically estimated) ~7% per C appears most likely in many regions [ix]. A very high-resolution model (typically 15km) used for weather forecasts with explicit convection has recently been used for a climate change experiment for a region in the United Kingdom. This study projects intensification of short-duration heavy rain in the summer, with significantly more events exceeding the high thresholds indicative of serious flash flooding [x].

"assessment  Soil moisture     Harmonised in situ data on soil moisture are not available across the EU. Modelled soil moisture content has significantly decreased in the Mediterranean region and increased in parts of northern Europe since the 1950s, as a result of past warming and precipitation changes.   Significant decreases in summer soil moisture content in the Mediterranean region and increases in north-eastern Europe are projected for the coming decades.     soil moisture climate emissions trends and projections trends    LSI LSI007 007,Past trends As a spatially and temporally comprehensive set of harmonised soil moisture data over a sufficient soil depth is not available, assessments of past trends in soil moisture rely on hydrological models driven by data on climate, soil characteristics, land cover and phenological phases. These simulations take account of changes in available energy, humidity and wind speed, but disregard artificial drainage and irrigation practices. Modelling of soil moisture content over the past 60 years suggests that there has been little change at the global and pan-European levels [i]. At the sub-continental scale, however, significant trends in summer soil moisture content can be observed (Figure 1). Soil moisture content has increased in parts of northern Europe, probably because of increases in precipitation amounts. In contrast, soil moisture has decreased in most of the Mediterranean region, particularly in south-eastern Europe, south-western Europe and southern France. The substantial increases in soil moisture content modelled over western Turkey should be considered with caution because of the limited availability of climate and soil data in the region, which affects the accuracy of the modelled trends [ii]. Projections Based on the results of 12 RCMs, the projected changes in soil moisture anomaly (Palmer Drought Severity Index) show a strong latitudinal gradient, from pronounced drier conditions in southern Europe to wetter conditions in northern European regions in all seasons (Figure 2). The largest changes in the soil moisture index between 20212050 and the baseline period (19611990) are projected for the summer period in the Mediterranean, especially in north-eastern Spain and south-eastern Europe [iii]. Projections for the end of the 21st century show significant decreases in summer soil moisture content in the Mediterranean region and central Europe, and increases in the north-eastern part of Europe [iv].

"assessment  Water- and food-borne diseases     It is not possible to assess whether past climate change has already affected water- and food-borne diseases in Europe, but the sensitivity of pathogens to climate factors suggest that climate change could be having effects on these diseases.   The number of vibriosis infections, which can be life-threatening, has increased substantially in Baltic Sea states since 1980. This increase has been linked to observed increases in sea surface temperature, which has improved environmental conditions for Vibrio species blooms in marine waters. The unprecedented number of vibriosis infections in 2014 has been attributed to the unprecedented 2014 heat wave in the Baltic region.   Increased temperatures could increase the risk of salmonellosis.   The risk of campylobacteriosis and cryptosporidiosis could increase in those regions where precipitation or extreme flooding is projected to increase.   Climate change can have an impact on food safety hazards throughout the food chain.     baltic sea climate change health infections    CLIM CLIM038 038,Vibrio species (non-cholera) Brackish water and elevated ambient temperature are ideal environmental growth conditions for certainVibriospecies. These conditions can be found during the summer months in estuaries and enclosed water bodies with moderate salinity, such as the Baltic Sea. In contrast, open ocean environments do not offer appropriate growth conditions for these bacteria owing to the high salt content, lower temperature and limited nutrient content. Of the most relevance to human health are theVibriospecies that can cause vibriosis infections, includingVibrio parahaemolyticus,Vibrio vulnificusand the non-toxigenicVibrio cholerae. Elevated levels of non-choleraVibriospecies infections have been observed during extended hot summer seasons with water temperatures above 20C in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea [i]. The availability of data is best for the Baltic Sea region, where a recent analysis found strong links between the temporal and spatial peaks in sea surface temperatures and the number and distribution of Vibrio infections. Figure 1 shows the observed and projected levels of Vibrio infections in the Baltic Sea region from 1982 to 2010, which was a period of unprecedented sea surface temperature warming [ii]. Increased numbers of infections can be expected based on the effects of increased temperatures under climate change scenarios. Figure 2 presents Vibrio risk maps for 2006 (left) and 2050 under elevated sea surface temperature (right). The projected increase in risk is substantial, but the absolute increase is projected to be modest owing to low current incidence rates. More recent studies in this region suggest that this warming trend has continued, with the July 2014 heat wave experienced in Sweden and Finland leading to an unprecedented number of Vibrio wound infections reported in the region, many at extremely high latitudes (e.g. >65N) [iii]. Environmentally acquired Vibrio infections in humans associated with particularly high sea surface temperatures have also been reported along the North Sea coast of Europe in recent years [iv]. Bacterial Vibrioblooms in coastal water can be monitored on the E3 Geoportal developed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [v]. The tool uses daily updated remotely sensed data to examine environmentally suitable conditions forVibrio species in coastal waters internationally. Cryptosporidium Cryptosporidiosis is an acute diarrhoeal disease caused by intracellular protozoan parasites, Cryptosporidiumspecies. Transmission is through the faecaloral route via contaminated water, soil or food products, and the most commonly identified vehicles are contaminated drinking water and contaminated recreational water. For example, several days of heavy rain in June 2013 resulted in river flooding in eastern Germany, and activities in the dried out floodplain led to infection among children [vi]. Heavy rainfall has also been associated with the contamination of water supplies and outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis [vii], as the concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts in river water increases significantly during rainfall events. Dry weather conditions preceding a heavy rain event have also been associated with drinking water outbreaks [viii]. Thus, heavy precipitation can result in the persistence of oocysts in the water distribution system and the infiltration of drinking water reservoirs from springs and lakes. Inadequate barriers to remove or inactivate Cryptosporidium in the public water supply have in the past resulted in a large outbreak of Cryptosporidium in Sweden [ix]. Campylobacter In Europe, campylobacteriosis is the most common bacterial cause of diarrhoeal disease. The association of campylobacteriosis with a number of weather-related factors, such as temperature, rainfall, humidity and sunshine is inconsistent and lacks a clear explanatory mechanism, as Campylobacterdoes not replicate outside its animal host. There is a clear seasonality to the data in a number of European countries, with more cases during the summer months, and an association with the ambient temperature that preceded the diagnosis of the cases by 10 to 14 weeks [x]. Temperature has also been found to be linked to cases in a number of studies from England and Wales [xi] but not in other countries [xii]. Rain in early spring can trigger campylobacteriosis outbreaks [xiii]. With the projected increase in heavy rainfall events in northern Europe, the risk of surface and groundwater contamination is expected to rise. Climate change might increase the use of rainwater for irrigation or drinking water during times of drought in certain locations. Norovirus Norovirus is the most common cause of viral diarrhoea in humans with a pronounced winter seasonality. Food-borne norovirus outbreaks have been linked to climate and weather events; for example, heavy rainfall and floods may lead to wastewater overflow which can contaminate shellfish farming sites. Flood water has been associated with a norovirus outbreak in Austria [xiv]. In Europe, norovirus season strength was positively associated with average rainfall in the wettest month [xv]. Water-borne transmission of the virus is probably influenced by rainfall, causing norovirus seasonality [xvi]. The magnitude of rainfall has also been related to viral contamination of the marine environment and with peaks in diarrhoea incidence [xvii]. The predicted increase of heavy rainfall events under climate change scenarios could lead to an increase in norovirus infections because floods are known to be linked to norovirus outbreaks. Salmonella Salmonellosis is the second most commonly reported gastrointestinal infection and an important cause of food-borne outbreaks in Europe. However, overall reported cases of salmonellosis have declined steadily for several years in Europe, in part because of control measures implemented in poultry production. An increase in weekly temperature has been associated with an increase in salmonellosis in different settings [xviii]. Seasonal temperatures have been linked to salmonellosis cases, but public health interventions can attenuate the effect of warmer temperature. Extreme precipitation events that result in faecal contamination events have also been associated with salmonellosis [xix]. Floods caused by heavy rainfall events may disrupt water treatment and sewage systems and contribute to increased exposure toSalmonella species and other pathogens. Available climate change projections indicate that the average annual number of temperature-related cases of salmonellosis in Europe may increase by almost 20000 by the 2020s, in addition to increases expected from population changes. Under a high emissions scenario, climate change could result in up to 50% more temperature-related cases by the end of the 21st century than would be expected on the basis of population change alone. However, these estimates are associated with high uncertainty [xx]. Moreover, health promotion and food safety policies can mitigate adverse impacts on public health.   [i] C. J.

"assessment-2  Global and European sea level     Global mean sea level has risen by 19.5cm from 1901 to 2015, at an average rate of 1.7mm/year, but with significant decadal variation. The rate of sea level rise since 1993, when satellite measurements have been available, has been higher, at around 3mm/year. Global mean sea level in 2015 was the highest yearly average over the record and ~70 mm higher than in 1993.   Evidence for a predominant role of anthropogenic climate change in the observed global mean sea level rise and for an acceleration during recent decades has strengthened since the publication of the IPCCAR5.   Most coastal regions in Europe have experienced an increase in absolute sea level and in sea level relative to land, but there is significant regional variation.   Extreme high coastal water levels have increased at most locations along the European coastline. This increase appears to be predominantly due to increases in mean local sea level rather than to changes in storm activity.   Global mean sea level rise during the 21st century will very likely occur at a higher rate than during the period 19712010. Process-based models considered in the IPCCAR5 project a rise in sea level over the 21st century that is likely in the range of 0.260.54m for a low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) and 0.450.81m for a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5). However, several recent studies suggest substantially higher values. Several national assessments, expert assessments and recent model-based studies have suggested an upper bound for 21st century global mean sea level rise in the range of 1.52.0m.   Available process-based models project that global mean sea level rise by 2300 will be less than 1m for greenhouse gas concentrations that peak and decline and do not exceed 500ppm CO 2 -equivalent, but will be in the range of 1m to more than 3m for concentrations above 700ppm CO 2 -equivalent. However, these models are likely to systematically underestimate the sea level contribution from Antarctica, and some recent studies suggest substantially higher rates of sea level rise in the coming centuries.   The rise in sea level relative to land along most European coasts is projected to be similar to the global average, with the exception of the northern Baltic Sea and the northern Atlantic Coast, which are experiencing considerable land rise as a consequence of post-glacial rebound.   Projected increases in extreme high coastal water levels are likely to mostly be the result of increases in local relative mean sea level in most locations. However, recent studies suggest that increases in the meteorologically driven surge component can also play a substantial role, in particular along the northern European coastline.     greenland ice sheet climate change oceans antartic ice sheet sea level coast glaciers flooding extreme events         CSI CSI047 CLIM CLIM012 047 012,Past trends: extreme sea level along the European coastline Producing a clear picture of either past changes or future projections of extreme high water levels for the entire European coastline is a challenging task because of the impact of local topographical features on surge events. While there are numerous studies for the North Sea coastline, fewer are available for the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea, although this situation is starting to improve. Extreme sea levels show pronounced short- and long-term variability. A recent review of extreme sea level trends along European coasts concluded that long-term trends are mostly associated with the corresponding mean sea level changes. Changes in wave and storm surge climate mostly contribute to interannual and decadal variability, but do not show substantial long-term trends [i]. When the contribution from local mean sea level changes and variations in tide are removed from the recent trends, the remaining effects of changes in storminess on extreme sea level are much smaller or even no longer detectable [ii]. Additional studies are available for some European coastal locations, but these typically focus on more limited spatial scales [iii]. The only region where significant increases in storm surge height were found during the 20th century is the Estonian coast of the Baltic Sea [iv]. In conclusion, while there have been detectable changes in extreme water levels around the European coastline, most of these are the result of changes in local mean sea level. The contribution from changes in storminess is currently small in most European locations and there is little evidence that any trends can be separated from long-term natural variability. Projections: extreme sea level at the European coastline Future projections of extreme sea level can be made using either process-based (dynamic) or empirical statistical modelling of storm surge behaviour driven by the output of global climate models [v]. Uncertainty in these projections for Europe remains high and is ultimately linked to the uncertainty in future mid-latitude storminess changes. This is an area where current scientific understanding is advancing quickly, as climate model representations of aspects of Northern Hemisphere storm track behaviour are showing improvements associated with, for instance, greater ocean and atmosphere resolution. However, the newest global climate models have not yet, typically, been downscaled to suitably fine scales and used in studies of future storm surges [vi]. It has generally been expected that projected increases in extreme sea level along the European coast during the upcoming decades will mostly be the result of mean sea level changes rather than changes in wave and storm surge climate [vii]. However, several recent studies suggest that changes in wave and storm surge climate may also play a substantial role in sea level changes during the 21st century in some regions. One recent study based on a multi-model ensemble projects an increase in storm surge level for most scenarios and return periods along the northern European coastline, which is more prominent for RCP8.5 than for RCP 4.5, and which can exceed 30% of the relative sea level rise. Storm surge levels along most European coastal areas south of 50N showed small changes [viii]. Similar results were obtained by another study, which found that increases in storm surges can contribute significantly to the projected increases of the 50-year flood height in north-western Europe, particularly along the European mainland coast [ix]. Sea level rise may also change extreme water levels by altering the tidal range. Tidal behaviour is particularly responsive in resonant areas of the Bristol Channel and the Gulf of Saint-Malo (with large amplitude decreases) and in the south-eastern German Bight and Dutch Wadden Sea (with large amplitude increases) [x]. The frequency of flooding events is estimated to increase by more than a factor of 10 in many European locations, and by a factor of more than 100 in some locations (Figure6) for the RCP4.5 scenario [xi]. Large changes in flood frequency mean that what is an extreme event today may become the norm by the end of the century in some locations. A 10cm rise in sea level typically causes an increase by about a factor of three in the frequency of flooding to a given height. However, for any particular location, it is important to look in detail at the change in the height of flood defences that might be required. Where the flood frequency curve is very flat, modest increases in flood defences be sufficient. Where the flood frequency curve is steeper, larger increases in protection height or alternative adaptation, including managed retreat, might be needed.

Many tide gauge measurements have long multi-decade time series, with some exceeding more than 100years. However, the results can be distorted by various local effects. Satellite altimeters enable sea level to be measured from space and give much better spatial coverage (except at high latitudes). However, the length of the altimeter record is limited to only about two decades. The IPCCAR5 estimated that GMSL rose by 19.5cm in the period between 1901 and 2015, which corresponds to an average rate of around 1.7mm/year (Figure1). This rate is somewhat higher than the sum of the known contributions to sea level rise over this period [i]. This value has been confirmed by more recent studies [ii]. One reanalysis suggests that GMSL during the 20th century rose at a lower rate of 1.20.2mm/year [iii], but this reanalysis has been criticised for its non-representative selection of tide gauges [iv]. Evidence from formal detection and attribution studies showing that most of the observed increase in GMSL since the 1950s can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change has increased since the publication of the IPCCAR5 [v]. All estimates for the rate of GMSL rise during the period since 1993, for which satellite-based measurements are available, are considerably higher than the 20th century trend, at 2.63.2mm/year [vi]. Different statistical methods for assessing sea level trends and changes therein can come to somewhat different conclusions [vii]. However, available assessments agree that an acceleration in the rate of GMSL rise since the early 1990s is detectable, despite significant decadal variation. Global mean sea level in 2015 was the highest yearly average over the record and ~70 mm higher than in 1993 [viii]. The causes of GMSL rise over recent decades are now reasonably well understood. Thermal expansion and melting of glaciers account for around 75% of the measured sea level rise since 1971. The contribution from melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets has increased since the early 1990s. Changes in land water storage have made only a small contribution, but the rate of groundwater extraction has increased recently and now exceeds the rate of storage in reservoirs [ix]. A recent study concludes that climate-driven variability in precipitation has resulted in increased water storage on land, and that global sea level rise in the period 20022014 would have been 1520% higher in the absence of this climate variability [x]. Past trends: mean sea level along the European coastline Sea level measurements for the European region are available from satellite altimeter observations (Figure2) and from tide gauges (Figure3). Satellite observations, which show changes in absolute sea level, are available from 1993. Tide gauge records can be more than 100years long; they show changes in relative sea level considering also land changes, which is more relevant for coastal protection than absolute sea level. Most European coastal regions experience increases in both absolute and relative sea level, but there are sizeable differences between the rates of absolute and relative sea level change across Europe. Figure2 shows linear trends in absolute sea level from 1992 to 2014 as observed by satellites. The main differences between regional seas and basins are primarily the result of different physical processes being the dominant cause of sea level change at different locations. For instance, the Mediterranean Sea is a semi-closed, very deep basin, exchanging water with the Atlantic Ocean through only the narrow Gibraltar Strait. Salinity in the Mediterranean Sea may increase in the future and this will tend to offset rises in sea level due to thermal expansion from warming. The NAO, interannual wind variability, changes in ocean circulation patterns, and the location of large-scale gyres and small-scale eddies are further factors that can influence local sea level in the European seas. Obviously, sea level changes in coastal zones are most relevant for society. Figure3 shows linear trends in relative sea level from 1970 to 2014 as observed by tide gauge stations in Europe. These trends can differ from those measured by satellites because of the longer time period covered and because tide gauge measurements are influenced by vertical land movement whereas satellite measurements are not. In particular, since the last ice age, the lands around the northern Baltic Sea have been, and are still, rising owing to the post-glacial rebound [xi]. Projections: global mean sea level Currently, there are two main approaches to projecting future sea level. Process-based models represent the most important known physical processes explicitly, whereas empirical statistical models look at the relationship between temperature (or radiative forcing) and sea level that has been observed in the past and extrapolate it into the future. A significant recent step forwards in projecting future sea levels is the improved understanding of the contributing factors to recently observed sea level rise, which has increased confidence in the use of process-based models for projecting the future [xii]. The IPCCAR5 concludes that the rate of GMSL rise during the 21st century will very likely exceed the rate observed in the period 19712010 for all emissions scenarios. Process-based models estimate the rise in GMSL for the period 20812100, compared with 19862005, to be likely in the range of 0.260.54m for RCP2.6, 0.320.62m for RCP4.5, 0.330.62m for RCP6.0 and 0.450.81m for RCP8.5. For RCP8.5, the rise in GMSL by 2100 is projected to be in the range of 0.530.97m, with a rate during 20812100 of 715mm/year. Based on current understanding, only a collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (i.e. those areas where the bed lies well below sea level and the edges flow into floating ice shelves) could cause GMSL to rise substantially (by up to several tenths of a metre) above the likely range projected for the 21st century, but the evidence is insufficient for estimating the likelihood of such a collapse (Figure4). Projections of sea level rise from recent empirical statistical models calibrated with newly available sea level reconstructions align with those from current process-based models [xiii]. Some recent studies highlight the contributions to recent sea level rise from ice sheet melting that were not included in the process-based models underlying the AR5 estimates above [xiv]. A broad expert assessment of future sea level rise resulted in higher estimates than those from the process-based models reviewed in the AR5. The best expert estimates for sea level rise during the 21st century were 0.40.6m for the low forcing scenario (RCP2.6) and 0.71.2m for the high forcing scenario (RCP8.5) [xv]. Similar results were derived in other recent studies [xvi]. A study that combined the model-based assessments from the AR5 with updated models and probabilistic expert assessment of the sea level contributions from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets suggests an upper limit for GMSL rise during the 21st century of 180cm, which has a 5% probability of being exceeded under the RCP8.5 forcing scenario [xvii]. Various national reports have also used values in the range of 1.52.0m as upper estimates for GMSL rise during the 21st century. One recent study suggests that ice sheet melting in Antarctica and Greenland could occur much faster than previously assumed, which would result in sea level rise of several metres during the 21st century [xviii], but these findings have been controversial. These high-end scenarios are somewhat speculative, but their consideration is nevertheless important for long-term coastal risk management, in particular in densely populated coastal zones [xix]. Sea level rise will continue far beyond 2100. Based on a limited number of available simulations with process-based models, the AR5 suggests that the GMSL rise by 2300 will be less than 1m for greenhouse gas concentrations that do not exceed 500ppm CO2-equivalent, but will be in the range of 1m to more than 3m for concentrations above 700ppm CO2-equivalent. However, the AR5 also considered it likely that the underlying models systematically underestimate Antarcticas future contribution to sea level rise [xx]. Estimates for GMSL rise beyond 2100 from the above-mentioned expert assessment are broadly comparable [xxi]. A more recent study suggests that melting of the Antarctic ice sheet alone could lead to sea level rise of more than 15m by 2500 under a high emissions scenario [xxii]. On a multi-millennial time scale, projections based on process-based models suggest a quasi-linear GMSL rise of 13m per degree of global warming for sustained warming over a period of 2000 years. Significantly higher estimates for GMSL rise on multi-millennial time scales, of up to 50m over 10000 years for a high emissions scenario, have been derived from the geological record [xxiii]. Projections: mean sea level along the European coastline Regional and local sea levels differ from the global mean owing to large-scale factors such as non-uniform changes in ocean density and changes in ocean circulation. Furthermore, disintegrating land-ice affects sea level differentially because of gravitational effects and the viscoelastic response of the lithosphere [xxiv]. Sea level is also affected by changes in atmospheric loading (the inverse barometer effect) and vertical land movement. While there remains considerable uncertainty in the spatial patterns of future sea level rise, around 70% of the worlds coastlines are expected to experience a local mean sea level change within 20% of the projected GMSL change [xxv]. Relative sea level change along most of the European coastline is projected to be reasonably similar to the global average. The main exceptions are the northern Baltic Sea and the northern Atlantic coast, which are experiencing considerable land rise as a consequence of post-glacial rebound. As a result, sea level relative to land in these regions is rising slower than elsewhere or may even decrease (Figure5) [xxvi]. A probabilistic assessment of regional sea-level rise in northern Europe reported central estimates of relative sea level change during the 21st century for the RCP8.5 emissions scenario from 14cm (in Lule, northern Sweden) to 84 cm in Den Helders (Netherlands); high estimates (with a 5% probability to be exceeded) range from 52cm to 181cm, respectively [xxvii]. A recent review study estimated that 21st century sea level rise along the Dutch coast would be in the range of 25 to 75cm for a low warming scenario and 50 to 100cm for a high warming scenario (year 2100, compared with the 19862005 baseline period) [xxviii]. Making regional projections for relatively small isolated and semi-closed ocean basins, such as the Mediterranean or the Baltic, is even more difficult than for the open ocean. Sea level rise substantially increases the risk of coastal flooding, which affects people, communities and infrastructure. For example, the ClimateCost and PESETAII projects have estimated that a 30cm sea level rise by the end of the 21st century, in the absence of public adaptation, would more than triple annual damages from coastal floods in the EU from EUR5 to 17billion [xxix]. These potential impacts can be substantially reduced by timely adaptation measures, but they are associated with significant costs [xxx].   [i] J. A.

"assessment  Heating and cooling degree days     The number of population-weighted heating degree days (HDD) decreased by 8.2 % between the 19511980 and 19812014 periods; the decrease during the 19812014 period was on average 9.9 HDDs per year (0.45 % per year). The largest absolute decrease occurred in northern and north-western Europe.   The number of population-weighted cooling degree days (CDD) increased by 49.1 % between the 19511980 and 19812014 periods; the increase during the period 19812014 was on average 1.2 HDDs per year (1.9 % per year). The largest absolute increase occurred in southern Europe.   The projected decrease in HDDs as a result of future climate change during the 21st century is somewhat larger than the projected increase in CDDs in absolute terms. However, in economic terms, these two effects are almost equal in Europe, because cooling is generally more expensive than heating.   The projected increases in the cooling demand in southern and central Europe may further exacerbate peaks in electricity demand in the summer unless appropriate adaptation measures are taken.     heating degree days cooling degree days hdd trend cdd trend    CLIM CLIM047 047,Past trends The number of population-weighted heating degree days (HDDs) decreased by 8.2% between the periods 19511980 and 19812014. The decrease during the period 19812014 was on average 9.9HDDs per year, although with substantial interannual variation (Figure 1, left); this linear trend corresponds to an annual decrease of 0.45% (relative to the 19511980 average). The largest absolute decrease occurred in northern and north-western Europe, where the heating demand is highest (Figure 2, left). The number of population-weighted cooling degree days (CDDs) increased by 49.1% between the periods 19511980 and 19812014. The increase during the period 19812014 was on average 1.2CDDs per year, although with substantial interannual variation (Figure 1, right); this linear trend corresponds to an annual increase of 1.9% (relative to the 19511980 average). The largest absolute increase occurred in southern Europe (latitudes below 45N), where the energy demand for cooling in summer is highest (Figure 2, right). The relative increase in CDDs is much higher than the relative decrease in HDDs, because of lower absolute values. In principle, HDD and CDD values can be added together to give a new indicator, energy degree days, which has shown a decrease since the 1950s. However, one must consider that HDDs and CDDs are climatological parameters and that the energy demand linked to their values is not the same, as heating and cooling systems are often based on different technologies. Figure 1 highlights some important features of the evolution of the pattern of HDDs and CDDs in Europe since the 1950s. In the first three decades, HDDs were roughly constant and CDDs declined slightly. Since the beginning of the 1980s, Europe has started experiencing a markedly declining overall trend in HDDs, and a markedly increasing trend in CDDs, pointing to a general increase in cooling needs and a general decrease in heating needs. Figure 2 shows that the decrease in HDDs has been particularly strong in the Alpine areas and the Baltic and Scandinavian countries, whereas the increase in CDDs is particularly strong in southern Europe, around the Mediterranean and in the Balkan countries. Some overlapping of medium to strong HDD and CDD effects is noticeable in Bulgaria, southern France, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Spain. Projections Temperatures in Europe are projected to continue to increase. Hence, the trend of a decreasing number of HDDs and an increasing number of CDDs is very likely to continue, and most likely to accelerate [i]. Model simulations performed in the ClimateCost project (based on HDD and CDD data) have estimated the decrease in residential heating energy demand in the EU as a result of climate change alone (above the SRES A1B baseline without climate change) to be 28 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe)/year by 2050 and 65Mtoe/year by 2100; the corresponding projected increase in cooling energy demand is 16Mtoe/year by 2050 and 53Mtoe/year by 2100. While the projected physical energy reductions for heating are higher than the increase in cooling demand, in economic terms the projected reduction in total heating demand is about the same as the increase in cooling demand, as cooling is more expensive than heating. In cold countries, such as Norway, the net effect of projected temperature increases reduces total energy demand, whereas in warm countries, such as Spain, it increases energy demand. All projected changes are considerably lower under a mitigation scenario with lower emissions [ii].   [i] Rasmus E.

"assessment  Meteorological and hydrological droughts     Drought has been a recurrent feature of the European climate. From 20062010, on average 15 % of the EU territory and 17 % of the EU population have been affected by meteorological droughts each year.   The severity and frequency of meteorological and hydrological droughts have increased in parts of Europe, in particular in south-western and central Europe.   Available studies project large increases in the frequency, duration and severity of meteorological and hydrological droughts in most of Europe over the 21st century, except for northern European regions. The greatest increase in drought conditions is projected for southern Europe, where it would increase competition between different water users, such as agriculture, industry, tourism and households.     river discharges river flow climate change water balances changes floods key climate variables precipitation drought         CLIM CLIM018 018,Past trends Drought has been a recurrent feature of the European climate. From 20062010, on average 15 % of the EU territory and 17 % of the EU population have been affected by meteorological droughts each year. In the 1990s and 2000s the drought hotspots were the Mediterranean area and the Carpathian Region [i]. The frequency of meteorological droughts in Europe has increased since 1950 in parts of southern Europe and central Europe (Austria and Hungary), but droughts have become less frequent in northern Europe and parts of eastern Europe (Figure 1, left). Trends in drought severity (based on a combination of Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI)) also show significant increases in the Mediterranean region (in particular the Iberian Peninsula, France, Italy and Albania) and parts of central and south-eastern Europe, and decreases in northern and parts of eastern Europe (Figure 1, right) [ii]. Most stream gauges in Europe show a decrease in summer low flows over the second half of the 20th century (Figure 2). However, current data availability is insufficient for attributing this trend to global climate change [iii]. Projections An assessment of European meteorological droughts based on different drought indices and an ensemble of RCMs has projected drier conditions for southern Europe for the mid-21st century, with increases in the length, magnitude and area of drought events [iv]. In contrast, drought occurrence was projected to decrease in northern Europe [v]. Similar results were obtained in later studies based on different indices and climate projections [vi]. A model ensemble from the EURO-CORDEX community projects that the frequency and duration of extreme meteorological droughts (defined as having a value below 2 of the SPI-6) will significantly increase in the future [vii]. These projections showed the largest increases in frequency for extreme droughts in parts of the Iberian Peninsula, southern Italy and the eastern Mediterranean, especially at the end of the century with respect to the baseline period 19712000 (Figure 3). The changes are most pronounced for the RCP8.5 high emissions scenario and slightly less extreme for the moderate (RCP4.5) scenario. Drought projections that also consider potential evapotranspiration (e.g. based on the SPEI, the Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) or the SupplyDemand Drought Index (SDDI)) showed substantially greater increases in the areas affected by drought than those based on the precipitation-based SPI alone. For example, the fraction of the Mediterranean region under drought was projected to increase by 10% by the end of the 21st century based on RCP8.5 using the SPI, whereas an increase of 60% was projected using the SPEI [viii]. The projected increases in droughts in large parts of southern Europe would increase competition between different water users, such as agriculture, industry, tourism and households. The top row of Figure 4 depicts the projected impact of climate change on the 20-year return level minimum river flow (also known as minimum discharge; left) and deficit volumes (right), which are two measures for water availability and drought intensity. An increasing severity of river flow droughts is projected for most European regions, except for northern and north-eastern Europe. The greatest increase in drought risk is projected for southern Europe, but mean increases are also projected for large parts of central and north-western Europe. However, these increases show large seasonal variations and also depend on how the models represent evapotranspiration and soil moisture [ix]. The bottom row of Figure 4 shows the combined impact of climate change and changes in water consumption (based on the Economy First water use scenario) on the same drought indices. In most regions, projected increases in water consumption further aggravate river flow droughts [x]. Water use and abstraction will exacerbate minimum low-flows in many parts of the Mediterranean region, leading to increased probabilities of water deficits when maximum water demand overlaps with minimum or low availability [xi].

"assessment  Crop water demand     Climate change led to an increase in the crop water demand and thus the crop water deficit from 1995 to 2015 in large parts of southern and eastern Europe; a decrease has been estimated for parts of north-western Europe.   The projected increases in temperature will lead to increased evapotranspiration rates, thereby increasing crop water demand across Europe. This increase may partly be alleviated through reduced transpiration at higher atmospheric CO 2  levels.   The impact of increasing water requirements is expected to be most acute in southern and central Europe, where the crop water deficit and irrigation requirements are projected to increase. This may lead to an expansion of irrigation systems, even in regions currently without irrigation systems. However, this expansion may be constrained by projected reductions in water availability and increased demand from other sectors and for other uses.     crops climate change crop water requirement grain maize crop water deficit     CLIM CLIM033 033,Past trends Irrigation in Europe is currently concentrated along the Mediterranean, where in some countries more than 80% of the total freshwater abstraction is used for agricultural purposes [i]. However, consistent observations of water demand and consumption for agriculture do not currently exist for Europe, partly because of unrecorded water abstractions and national differences in accounting and reporting. Modelling approaches can be used to compute net irrigation requirements. Two studies estimated the net irrigation requirements in Europe for 19952002 and for the year 2000 with a total of three different model systems [ii]. The results show an irrigation requirement of up to 2140km3 for Spain, which had the highest net irrigation requirement in the EU-27. Crop water demand, defined as the water consumed during the growing season, depends on the crop type and the timing of the growing season. Water demand can be modelled using meteorological data and information on crop management, and the difference between crop water demand and rainfall constitutes the crop water deficit. Figure 1 shows the change in the crop water deficit for grain maize, which is a crop that is often grown under irrigated conditions because it is mostly grown during the summer season. The hatched areas in Figure 1 show the areas where crop water demand exceeds average rainfall and thus may have an irrigation demand. The trends for 19952015 show an increase in the crop water deficit for maize in large parts of southern and eastern Europe; a decrease has been estimated for parts of north-western Europe. Some of the effects of estimated changes in the crop water deficit may also be related to the duration of the crop growing period, which is shortened under higher temperatures, thus leading to less water being consumed. Projections A multi-model study using seven global hydrological models driven by five global climate models under four RCP scenarios estimated changes in irrigation water demand (IWD) across regions during the 21st century. Under the low and low-to-medium emissions scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, respectively), the simulated changes in IWD across Europe were small. For RCP6.0, the multi-model average suggests a substantial increase in IWD in most of Europe. For RCP8.5, the projected increase in IWD exceeds 25% in most of the irrigated regions in Europe [iii]. Most hydrological models in this multi-model study did not consider the physiological effect of increased CO2, which can increase the water-use efficiency of crop plants. The only available study using a hydrological and a crop model that considers the physiological effect of increased CO2 still estimates that there is a high likelihood that IWD in southern Europe will increase by more than 20% until 2080 [iv]. Regional case studies suggest much higher increases in IWD in some regions [v]. Climate change will also affect water availability. The Mediterranean area is projected to experience a decline in water availability, and future irrigation will be constrained by reduced run-off and groundwater resources, by demand from other sectors and by economic costs [vi]. Assuming that urban water demands would be prioritised over agricultural purposes, the proportional reduction of water availability for irrigation in many European basins is larger than the reduction in annual run-off [vii]. The projected changes in the crop water deficit for grain maize are shown in Figure 2 for two different climate models. The simulations are based on the WOFOST crop model, which considers the effect of increases in the CO2 concentrations on the water use efficiency of maize. The simulations for both climate model projections for the 2030s show an increasing crop water deficit for large areas of Europe, in particular over central Europe. This will increase the water requirement for irrigation, including in areas not currently applying irrigation. Adaptation measures and the integrated management of water, often at catchment scale, are needed to address future competing demands for water between agriculture, energy, conservation and human settlements. New irrigation infrastructure will be required in some regions [viii].

"assessment  Water-limited crop yield     Yields of several rainfed crops are levelling off (e.g. wheat in some European countries) or decreasing (e.g. grapes in Spain), whereas yields of other crops (e.g. maize in northern Europe) are increasing. These changes are attributed partly to observed climate change, in particular warming.   Extreme climatic events, including droughts and heat waves, have negatively affected crop productivity in Europe during the first decade of the 21st century.   Future climate change could lead to both decreases and increases in average yield, depending on the crop type and the climatic and management conditions in the region. There is a general pattern of projected increases in productivity in northern Europe and reductions in southern Europe, but with differences between crop types.   Projected increases in extreme climatic events are expected to increase crop yield variability and to lead to yield reductions in the future throughout Europe.     wheat climate change agriculture crop yield    CLIM CLIM032 032,Past trends A global analysis of yields of cereal crops (wheat, maize and barley) has shown that increasing mean temperatures in recent decades have had a negative effect on yield [i]. Similar effects have been observed for various countries in Europe [ii]. Increasing temperatures have been identified as one of the main causes of the lack of yield increase in winter wheat in France, despite improvements in crop breeding [iii]. Grain yields in southern Europe seem to have been levelling off. There is also a tendency for an increasing variability of grain yields in France and Italy, linked to the occurrence of heat waves and droughts [iv]. Similar effects of heat haves and droughts have been observed globally, whereas floods and intense rainfall have not been seen to affect overall crop production [v]. In Italy and southern-central Europe, the potential crop yields of potato, wheat, maize and barley significantly decreased over the time period 19762005 owing to temperature and radiation change effects [vi]. In north-east Spain, grape yield has been declining because of increasing water deficits since the 1960s [vii]. Droughts and heat waves affected the crop production in large areas of southern and central Europe in 2003 and 2007 [viii]. An increase in climate-induced variability in maize yield has been observed over recent decades in France [ix]. Climate change has also shown positive effects on yields. Potato and sugar beet have responded positively to increasing temperatures through an increase in yields, most likely due to the longer growing seasons [x]. In Scotland, increasing temperatures are estimated to have increased the potential potato yield by up to 39% over the period 19602006 [xi]. In parts of the UK and parts of northern-central Europe, the yield potential of wheat, sugar beet and maize has increased since 1976 [xii]. Grain yields in maize have been steadily increasing in northern Europe, most likely linked to the warmer climate [xiii]. Projections The impact of future changes in climate on crop yield depends on the characteristics of the climatic change within a region, as well as on a combination of other environmental, economic, technological and management factors [xiv]. A broad analysis of climate change scenarios for agricultural productivity in Europe has provided a clear picture of deterioration of agroclimatic conditions through increased drought stress and a shortening of the active growing season across large parts of southern and central Europe [xv]. Other studies suggest an increasing number of unfavourable years for agricultural production in many European climatic zones, limiting winter crop expansion and increasing the risk of cereal yield loss [xvi]. Dynamic crop models may be used to evaluate the effect of climate change on crop production, provided that the model is tested for the accuracy of its response to various climate change factors [xvii]. Figure 1 shows projected changes in water-limited winter wheat yields in Europe for the 2030s (compared with the 2000s) for climate projections from two different climate models (HadGEM2-ES) and MIROC-ESM-CHEM) using the WOFOSTcrop model. The top row of the map shows the results when the CO2 concentration is assumed to be that of the 2000s, whereas the bottom row shows the results when the effect of CO2 fertilisation on crop growth was simulated. When no CO2 fertilisation effect is taken into account, simulations using both climate models show a decrease in wheat yields over most of Europe, with the exception of some northern areas. When the CO2 fertilisation effect is taken into account, model simulations generally show a yield increase in most areas, with the notable exception of central Europe for one climate model (HadGEM2). The simulated moderate yield reduction over central Europe for this model indicates that increased CO2 does not compensate for unfavourable climatic conditions, such as prolonged and more intense droughts. These simulations did not include adaptations to climate change, such as changes in crop species and crop management, owing to the inherent complexity of agricultural systems. Therefore, the projected yields in 2030 may be slightly underestimated. A study on the potential effectiveness by 2040 of adaptation by farmers in southern and central Europe suggests that the adaptation potential to future warming is large for maize but limited for wheat and barley [xviii]. Future crop yield developments are subject to considerable uncertainty, in particular with regard to climate projections and the magnitude of CO2 fertilisation effects in practice. For example, Figure 1 does not consider all of the main sources of uncertainty, as only two climate models and one crop model have been used to produce the simulations. A wider variation would have been found if more climate model projections and more crop models had been used. A large proportion of the uncertainty in climate change impact projections for crop yields are the result of variations among different crop models rather than the variations among the downscaled climate projections [xix]. Uncertainties in simulated impacts increase with higher CO2 concentrations and associated warming. Figure 2 provides an aggregated picture of the expected changes in crop yields across Europe by considering three crops, an ensemble of 12 GCMs and the current irrigated area. These estimates include the effects of changes in temperature, precipitation and CO2 concentration on crop yield. The regional pattern of projected impacts is clear, generally showing improved conditions in northern Europe and worse conditions in southern Europe. Despite the above-mentioned uncertainties, there is a clear indication of deteriorating agroclimatic conditions in terms of increased drought stress and a shortening of the active growing season in central and southern Europe [xx]. There is a risk of an increasing number of extremely unfavourable years, which might lead to higher interannual variability in crop yield and constitute a challenge for proper crop management. Some of the climate-related risk factors, such as high temperature stress, flooding and adverse sowing and harvesting conditions, are included only to a limited extent in current crop models, such as those used for the projections in Figure 1. Figure 3 shows that the frequency of adverse agroclimatic conditions for wheat is projected to increase substantially across Europe under climate change, with the largest risks generally experienced in southern parts of Europe. These increases in extreme events may severely restrict the efficiency of adaptations to climate change, including the shifting of wheat production to other regions as the risk of adverse events beyond the key wheat-growing areas increases even more [xxi].

"assessment  Agrophenology     The flowering of several perennial and annual crops has advanced by about two days per decade during the last 50 years.   Changes in crop phenology are affecting crop production and the relative performance of different crop species and varieties. The shortening of the grain-filling phase of cereals and oilseed crops can be particularly detrimental to yield.   Shortening of the growth phases of many crops is expected to continue, but this may be altered by selecting other crop cultivars and changing planting dates, which in some cases can lead to longer growth periods.     climate agriculture atmosphere   CLIM CLIM031 031,Past trends Changes in the phenological phases of several perennial crops in Europe, such as advances in the start of the growing season of fruit trees (2.3 days/decade), cherry tree blossom (2.0 days/decade) and apple tree blossom (2.2 days/decade), in line with increases of up to 1.4C in mean annual air temperature, were observed in Germany during 19612000 [i]. Sowing or planting dates of several agricultural crops have advanced; for example, for oats in Germany (19592009), sowing has advanced by 0.2 days/decade, flowering by 1.9 days/decade, maturity by 3.3 days/decade and harvest by 2.1 days/decade [ii]. This indicates that factors other than temperature may be affecting sowing and harvesting dates, e.g. soil workability and grain moisture for harvesting. An analysis of the modelled flowering date for winter wheat in Europe between 1985 and 2014 shows a general and clear increasing trend, which is most pronounced in north-western Europe (Figure 1). In large parts of Europe, the modelled flowering date has advanced by two to four days/decade. This modelled advance in flowering date probably exceeds what is observed in reality, as a longer growth duration will alter plants responses to day length and farmers choices of cultivars, reducing the overall response. Projections With the projected warming of the climate in Europe, further reductions in the number of days required for flowering and to reach maturity in cereals may be expected throughout Europe [iii]. Since many plants (including cereals) in Europe require long days to flower, the effect of warming on the date of flowering is smaller than would otherwise be expected. The flowering date for winter wheat was projected to show the greatest advance in western parts of Europe, with an advance of up to two weeks by 2050. The projected advance in the date of reaching maturity is greater than the advance in flowering date, leading to a shortening of the grain-filling period, which will negatively affect yields. One of the main adaptation options to cope with the shortening of crop growth phases is choosing crop cultivars that have higher thermal requirements, as this will reduce the negative yield effects of a shorter growth duration. In practice, this needs to be balanced against the need to avoid periods of high temperature stresses and drought. Breeding for crop cultivars with optimal timing of crop phenological phases is therefore a critical adaptation option [iv].

"assessment  Growing season for agricultural crops     The thermal growing season for agricultural crops in Europe has lengthened by more than 10 days since 1992. The delay in the end of the growing season has been more pronounced than the advance of the start of the season. The length of the growing season has increased more in northern and eastern Europe than in western and southern Europe.   The growing season is projected to increase further throughout most of Europe owing to the earlier onset of growth in spring and later senescence in autumn.   The projected lengthening of the thermal growing season would allow a northwards expansion of warm-season crops to areas that were not previously suitable. In parts of southern Europe (e.g. Spain), warmer conditions will allow crop cultivation to be shifted to the winter.     climate agriculture atmosphere   CLIM CLIM030 030,Past trends Increasing air temperatures are significantly affecting the duration of the growing season over large areas of Europe. Many studies report a lengthening of the period between the occurrence of the last spring frost and the first autumn frost. This has occurred in recent decades in several areas in Europe and more generally in the Northern Hemisphere [i]. Studies of changes in the growing season based on remote sensing show a diverse spatial pattern in Europe [ii]. Across all of Europe, the delay in the end of the season of 8.2 days in the period 19922008 was more significant than the advanced start of the season by 3.2 days [iii]. An analysis of the frost-free period in Europe between 1985 and 2014 shows a general and clear increasing trend (Figure 1). The trend is not uniformly spread over Europe. The highest rates of change (an extension of the frost-free period by more than 0.8 days per year) were recorded in eastern and northern Europe; little or no change was observed along the Mediterranean coast, where frost is a rare phenomenon. Projections A warming of the climate is expected to result in an earlier start of the growing season in spring and a longer duration in autumn. The date of the last frost in spring is projected to advance by about 510 days by 2030 and by 1015 days by 2050 throughout most of Europe [iv]. A longer growing season will, in many cases, allow for the introduction of new crop species that were previously unfavourable owing to low temperatures or short growing seasons, but it may also increase the spread of weeds, insect pests and diseases [v]. The suitability for growing certain crops will also depend on the total amount of heat received during the growing season, expressed as a temperature sum. Projections show that the greatest absolute increases in temperature sum will be in southern Europe, whereas relative changes are much larger in northern than in southern Europe [vi]. The extension of the growing season is expected to be particularly beneficial in northern Europe, where new crops could be cultivated and where water availability generally does not restrict growth [vii]. In parts of the Mediterranean area, the cultivation of some crops may shift from the summer season to the winter season, which could offset some of the negative impacts of heat waves and droughts during summer. Other areas of Europe, such as western France and parts of south-eastern Europe, will experience yield reductions from hot, dry summers without the possibility of shifting the crop production into the winter seasons [viii].

"assessment  Vector-borne diseases     The transmission cycles of vector-borne diseases are sensitive to climatic factors, but disease risks are also affected by factors such as land use, vector control, human behaviour, population movements and public health capacities.   Climate change is regarded as the principal factor behind the observed move of the tick species Ixodes ricinus  the vector of Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis in Europe  to higher latitudes and altitudes. Climate change is projected to lead to further northwards and upwards shifts in the distribution of Ixodes ricinus.   It is generally suspected that climate change has played (and will continue to play) a role in the expansion of other disease vectors, notably the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), which can disseminate several diseases including dengue, chikungunya and Zika, and Phlebotomus species of sandflies, which transmit leishmaniasis.   The unprecedented upsurge in the number of human West Nile fever infections in the summer of 2010 in south-eastern Europe was preceded by extreme hot spells in this region. High temperature anomalies in July were identified as contributing factors to the recurrent outbreaks in the subsequent years.     climate chikungunya transmission diseases west nile fever climate change human health climate suitability       CLIM CLIM037 037,Past trends: tick-borne diseases Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) are the two most important tick-borne diseases in Europe, both of which are transmitted primarily by Ixodes ricinus. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the EU, with a reported incidence of approximately 65000 cases per year. However, there is no standardised case definition or diagnosis for Lyme disease in Europe, so this number represents only a best estimate. The number of reported cases of TBE in the EU was 2560 during 2012. The mean annual reporting of TBE cases has increased by approximately 400% in European endemic areas over the past 30 years, although this is almost certainly the result of more robust detection methods and diagnosis [i]. A key determinant of the number of reported cases is the abundance of ticks, a factor which is sensitive to climatic variables, notably temperature and humidity. Currently,Ixodes ricinusis present across much of continental Europe (Figure 1). There have already been reports on the northerly migration of the tick species in Sweden [ii], and to higher altitudes in the Czech Republic and Austria [iii]. Range shifts have also been observed in Germany and Norway [iv]. A high incidence of tick-borne disease is correlated with mild winters and warm, humid summers in Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden, although this could be the result of climate effects on human behaviour [v]. A high risk of Lyme disease has been associated with mild winters, high summer temperatures, low seasonal variation of temperatures and high scores on vegetation indices [vi]. There are considerable differences between the distribution of ticks and the observed incidence of TBE [vii]. It is not currently possible to assess the relative importance of climatic changes and of other factors influencing disease incidence, including vaccination coverage, tourism patterns, public awareness, distribution of rodent host populations and socio-economic conditions [viii]. There is limited evidence that other tick-borne diseases may be sensitive to climate change. Some models have suggested that the Mediterranean basin has become suitable for an expansion of CrimeanCongo haemorrhagic fever [ix], but demographic factors, farming practices and land-use change may be more important drivers [x]. The distribution of Rickettsia has also expanded in recent years, but the reasons for this are not yet well understood [xi], and few if any recent studies have interrogated the links between rickettsia diseases and climate change. Past trends: mosquito-borne diseases Mosquito habitats are influenced by temperature, humidity and precipitation levels. The Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) is an important vector in Europe for transmitting viral diseases, including Zika, chikungunya and dengue. The first record of its establishment was in Italy in 1990, and Aedes albopictusis now present in several EU countries and in some countries neighbouring the EU (Figure 2). It has substantially extended its range in recent years, aided by trade and travel. It is generally suspected that climate change has also played a role in this expansion, but the extent to which this is the case is unclear [xii]. The introduction and geographical expansion of the distribution of Aedes albopictus within Europe has coincided with favourable climatic suitability for the mosquito in the Balkans, Italy, France and Benelux and in western Germany, on the eastern coast of Spain and on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea [xiii]. Other parts of Europe are also climatically suitable for Aedes albopictus, even if they have not recorded the presence of the vector (Figure 3) [xiv]. Mosquito-borne diseases have not been a substantial concern within Europe until recently. However, locally transmitted (i.e. autochthonous) outbreaks of chikungunya, dengue and even malaria have occurred in recent years [xv]. Several disease outbreaks transmitted by Aedes. albopictus have been reported in Europe: chikungunya in Italy and in France in 2010, 2014 and 2015, as well as local transmissions of dengue in France and Croatia in 2010 [xvi]. Heavy rainfall events may have increased the risk of the autochthonous transmission of chikungunya in France in 2014 by leading to a rapid rise in vector abundance [xvii]. No autochthonous transmission of dengue has been reported in Europe since 2010. The risk of travellers importing Zika, dengue or chikungunya coincides with the seasons and locations of active Aedes albopictusin Europe [xviii]. With continued expansion of Aedes albopictus in continental Europe, the risk of further introduction and transmission of Zika, chikungunya and dengue will continue to exist. The risk of chikungunya introductions into Europe via returning travellers has probably increased following the large-scale outbreak of chikungunya that began in the Caribbean in late 2013 and has subsequently continued in many American countries [xix]. Aedes albopictusis not the primary vector for dengue and, although some parts of Europe are currently climatically suitable to its primary vector (Aedesaegypti), the risk of significant dengue transmission in continental Europe is currently very low, providing that the vector remains unestablished and control measures are in place [xx]. Aedes aegypti has, however, been responsible for dengue outbreaks in European territories, such as the 2013 outbreak in Madeira, Portugal [xxi]. Malaria was largely eradicated in Europe in the second half of the 20th century. However, the malaria vectors (Anopheles mosquitos) are still present in much of the European Union, and a few sporadic cases of local transmission occur each year [xxii]. The risk of malaria re-establishment in a particular region depends on climatic and ecological factors, as well as human vulnerabilities to infection. During 20092012, Greece experienced autochthonous malaria transmission; temperature and other environmental variables were identified as determinants of environmental suitability [xxiii]. However, socio-economic development is a key mitigating factor of malaria risk [xxiv], which therefore remains very low throughout Europe. West Nile virus (WNV) infections in humans can be quite severe, particularly among the elderly, but many other cases can go unnoticed (more than 60% are asymptomatic) and occur through mosquito (Culexspecies) bites. Cases can also be acquired through blood transfusion or organ, tissue and cell transplantations and, although rare, such cases have been reported [xxv]. Since 2010, there have been annual outbreaks in south-eastern and eastern Europe, suggesting an endemic transmission cycle and thus a resurgent public health problem (Figure 4) [xxvi]. Positive temperature anomalies from the monthly averages were the most important determinants of the 2010 WNV outbreak [xxvii]. Over the subsequent years, other environmental drivers (besides temperature) were also identified as important, such as the state of vegetation, water bodies (modified normalised difference water index) and bird migratory routes [xxviii]. Past trends: sandfly-borne diseases Leishmaniasis is the most common disease transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies in Europe. The transmission of the two parasites responsible for this disease that are endemic in the EU (Leishmania infantum, causing visceral leishmaniasis, and Leishmania tropica, causing cutaneous leishmaniasis) is heavily influenced by temperature. Leishmania tropica occurs sporadically in Greece and neighbouring countries, while Leishmania infantum is endemic in the Mediterranean region of the EU. Sandfly vectors currently have wider distribution ranges than the parasites. The evidence for an impact of climate change on the distribution of the sandfly in Europe is scarce [xxix]. Climate change was suggested as one possible reason for the observed northwards expansion of sandfly vectors in Italy [xxx]. The contemporary risk for central Europe has been estimated to be low owing to temperature constraints on pathogen growth [xxxi]. Projections: tick-borne diseases Cold temperatures appear to determine the altitudinal and latitudinal limits of Ixodes ricinus[xxxii]. Thus, an expansion of the distribution range of ticks to higher altitudes and latitudes is projected, as milder winter temperatures, longer vegetation seasons and earlier onsets of summer appear and warmer temperatures occur, under the condition that their natural hosts (deer) would also shift their distribution [xxxiii]. One climate projection model anticipates a 3.8% overall habitat expansion for Ixodes ricinus in Europe by 20402060, with expansion into higher altitudes and latitudes (notably Scandinavia and the Baltic countries) and a contraction in some areas including the Alps, the Pyrenees, the interior of Italy and north-western Poland [xxxiv]. This aligns with other models of climate change that anticipate Ixodes ricinus range expansions under climate change scenarios [xxxv], but it has been acknowledged that many uncertainties exist in these models and that extrapolating the projected habitat range of ticks to generate projections of the incidence of tick-borne disease leads to additional uncertainties. Nonetheless, the incidence of TBE may shift to higher altitudes and latitudes along with the distribution of Ixodes ricinus, potentially increasing the risk in some parts of northern and central Europe, unless targeted vaccination programmes and TBE surveillance are introduced. Similarly, TBE risk is generally expected to decrease in southern Europe. Warmer winters may facilitate the expansion of Lyme disease to higher latitudes and altitudes, particularly in northern Europe, but it would decrease in the parts of Europe that are projected to experience increased droughts [xxxvi]. Projections: mosquito-borne diseases Various studies have found that warm seasonal and annual temperature and sufficient rainfall provide favourable climatic conditions for Aedes albopictusin Europe [xxxvii]. The climatic suitability for Aedes albopictus is projected to increase where climate models project warmer and wetter climates, such as south-eastern United Kingdom [xxxviii], the Balkans and central Europe, while suitability generally decreases where climate becomes drier, such as in some regions of Spain and Portugal [xxxix]. This corresponds with a modelling study that demonstrated a general decline in habitat suitability in southern Europe and the Mediterranean area, and an increase in habitat suitability in northern and eastern European countries [xl]. The risk of chikungunya may increase in Europe, particularly in those regions where the seasonal activity of Aedes albopictusaligns with the seasonality of endemic chikungunya infections abroad, thereby potentially increasing the risk of importation via travellers [xli]. Models of chikungunya transmission in Europe under climate change scenarios have identified France, northern Italy and the Pannonian Basin (east-central Europe) as the areas at highest risk, with increases in the level of risk in much of western Europe, including the Benelux countries and Germany. In contrast, Mediterranean regions demonstrated a decreased risk, although the models suggested that they will mostly remain climatically suitable for chikungunya transmission (Figure 5) [xlii]. A climate-related increase in the density or active season ofAedes albopictuscould lead to a small increase in the risk of dengue in Europe. The risk could also increase if the temperature increase facilitated the re-establishment ofAedes aegypti, the primary dengue vector. Further modelling studies are required to assess whether climate change would increase or decrease the climatic suitability forAedes aegyptiin continental Europe. Some malaria models suggest that there will be increased suitability for malaria transmission in continental Europe under future climate change, but projected malaria impacts are highly sensitive to model design [xliii]. Nevertheless, socio-economic development, land-use and public health control measures would most likely be sufficient to mitigate the risk of malaria at the fringes of its distribution, despite the likelihood of sporadic introductions of the parasite through global travel [xliv]. Climate change has previously not been expected to have a significant impact on WNV transmission in Europe [xlv]. However, climate change could influence the transmission of the virus by affecting the geographical distribution of vectors and pathogens, by changing the migratory patterns of bird populations and through changes in the life cycle of bird-associated pathogens. Temperature increases could also play a role. The WNV risk in Europe has been projected into 2025 and 2050, with July temperature projections under a medium emissions scenario (IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B), keeping other variables constant (e.g. state of vegetation, water bodies and bird migratory routes) [xlvi]. The results reveal a progressive expansion of areas with an elevated probability for WNV infections, particularly at the edges of the transmission areas (Figure 6). Projections for 2025 show an increased probability of WNV infection in eastern Croatia, north-eastern Greece and north-western Turkey; high-risk areas will have expanded even more by 2050. Projections: sandfly-borne diseases Future climate change could have an impact on the distribution of leishmaniasis by affecting the abundance of vector species and parasite development. Recent modelling indicates that the central European climate will become increasingly suitable for Phlebotomus species of sandflies [xlvii]. One modelling study concluded that, by the end of the 2060s, France, Germany, western Poland and southern United Kingdom could be colonised by sandfly species, principally Phlebotomus ariasi and Phlebotomus pernicious, while the entire Mediterranean Basin, Balkan Peninsula and Pannonian Basin would all be potentially climatically suitable habitats for many Phlebotomus species [xlviii]. Such expansions of sandfly species would increase the risk of leishmaniasis, but may be somewhat constrained by the limited migration ability of sandflies. The risk of disease transmission may also decrease in some areas in southern Europe where climate conditions become too hot and dry for vector survival.   [i] J. M.

"assessment  Extreme temperatures and health     Heat waves and extreme cold spells are associated with decreases in general population well-being and with increases in mortality and morbidity, especially in vulnerable population groups. Temperature thresholds for health impacts differ according to the region and season.   The number of heat extremes has substantially increased across Europe in recent decades. Heat waves have caused tens of thousands of premature deaths in Europe since 2000.   It is virtually certain that the length, frequency and intensity of heat waves will increase in the future. This increase will lead to a substantial increase in mortality over the next decades, especially in vulnerable population groups, unless adaptation measures are taken.   Cold-related mortality is projected to decrease owing to better social, economic and housing conditions in many countries in Europe. There is inconclusive evidence about whether or not the projected warming will lead to a further substantial decrease in cold-related mortality.     mortality temperatures temperature mortality   CLIM CLIM036 036,Past trends In large parts of Europe, summertime temperature records, which are associated with prolonged heat waves, have increased substantially in recent decades. The summer of 2003 broke temperature records in large parts of western Europe; temperature records were again broken in different parts of Europe during the summers of 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2015 [i]. The record warm summer of 2003 was an outstanding example of increased mortality during periods of extreme temperatures, with an estimated premature mortality of 70000 people in Europe [ii]. The heat waves of the summer of 2015 caused more than 3000 deaths in France alone [iii]. The largest effect of heat has been observed among the elderly, but in some cities younger adults have also been affected [iv]. Elderly people are more vulnerable to the effects of heat waves, owing, in part, to poorer physical health and the effects of cognitive impairment on the perception of heat-related health risk; this is the population considered most at risk of heat-related mortality [v]. In addition to the elderly, those with chronic diseases and persons of lower socio-economic status also have a heightened risk of heat-related mortality [vi]. Furthermore, health risks during heat extremes are greater in people who are physically very active. This has importance for outdoor recreational activities, and it is especially relevant for the impacts of climate change on occupational health (e.g. for manual labourers) [vii]. The above-mentioned multi-country global observational study found that (moderate) cold was responsible for a higher proportion of deaths than (moderate) heat. The study collected data for daily mortality, temperature and other confounding variables from Italy (11 cities, 19872010), Spain (51 cities, 19902010), Sweden (one county, 19902002), the United Kingdom (10 regions, 19932006) and other areas outside Europe [viii]. The results should be interpreted with caution when applied to other regions that were not included in the database. Figure 1 shows the overall cumulative exposureresponse curves for four European cities with the corresponding minimum mortality temperature and the cut-os used to define extreme temperatures. Risk increases slowly and linearly for cold temperatures below the minimum mortality temperature, although some locations (e.g. London and Madrid) showed a higher increase for extreme cold than others. Risk generally escalated quickly and non-linearly at high temperatures. Deaths attributable to extreme heat are roughly as frequent as those attributable to moderate heat, while those attributable to extreme cold are negligible compared with those caused by moderate cold [ix]. Other studies have estimated that 1.62.0% of total mortality in the warm season is attributable to heat; about 40% of these deaths occur on isolated hot days in periods that would not be classified as heat waves [x]. Comparison of these estimates should be made with caution, as not only the methods used to estimate the excess deaths, but also the exposures were different. The impact of high temperatures later in the summer is sometimes diminished after an early heat wave. In Europe, heat waves occurring in June result in relatively high mortality compared with those occurring later in the summer [xi]. Synergistic effects between high temperature and air pollution (Particles in the atmosphere with a diameter of less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometres (PM10) and ozone) have been observed to have led to an increase in hospital admissions as a result of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Furthermore, long warm and dry periods, in combination with other factors, can lead to forest fires, which can also have severe health impacts [xii]. Projections It is virtually certain that heat extremes will continue to become more frequent over most land areas in the future. The number of monthly heat records globally is projected to be more than 12 times as high under a medium global warming scenario by the 2040s as in a climate with no long-term warming [xiii]. The projected return period of extreme heat events, such as those experienced in 2003 in western Europe, will signicantly shorten. This increase in heat extremes will lead to a marked increase in heat-attributable deaths under future warming, unless adaptation measures are taken. Highly urbanised areas are projected to be at an increased risk of heat stress compared with surrounding areas. Projections of future heat effects on human health need to consider that the European population is projected to age, because elderly populations are especially vulnerable [xiv]. Several studies have estimated future heat-related mortality in Europe using similar methods and have arrived at largely comparable results, namely PESETA, ClimateCost and PESETAII [xv]. The PESETA study estimates that, without adaptation and physiological acclimatisation, heat-related mortality in Europe would increase by between 60000 and 165000 deaths per year by the 2080s compared with the present baseline, with the highest impacts in southern Europe. The results vary across climate models and emissions scenarios, with high emissions scenarios leading to much higher heat-related mortality than low emissions scenarios. Heat-related mortality would be significantly lower under full acclimatisation if, for example, currently cool regions were able to achieve the temperaturemortality relationship of currently warm regions [xvi]. The results from the PESETA II study confirm, to a large extent, the results of earlier assessments (in particular, those from the PESETA and ClimateCost projects), although with slightly higher impacts (both in physical and economic terms) [xvii]. Comparable estimates were made by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the WHO European Region [xviii]. Another study estimates that climate change will lead to an increase in hospital admissions owing to heat-related respiratory diseases from 11000 admissions (0.18%) in the period 19812010 to 26000 (0.4%) in 20212050. The total number of hospital admissions and the increase as a result of climate change are largest in southern Europe, with the proportion of heat-related admissions for respiratory conditions expected to approximately triple in this region over this time period [xix]. The PESETA study estimated that cold-related mortality would decrease by between 60000 and 250000 deaths per year by the 2080s, which is about the same magnitude as the projected increase in heat-related mortality [xx]. The PESETA II study no longer considers a potential reduction in cold-related mortality in its climate impact estimates [xxi]. The choice not to include cold spells reflects recent evidence that does not suggest a significant shift in the balance of deaths between winters and summers because of lower cold-related mortality [xxii]. However, the risk from (moderate) cold is expected to continue to account for most of the temperature-related risk throughout this century [xxiii].   [i] D.

"assessment  Floods and health     River and coastal flooding have affected many millions of people in Europe since 2000. Flooding affects human health through drowning, heart attacks, injuries, infections, exposure to chemical hazards and mental health consequences. Disruption of services, including health services, safe water, sanitation and transportation ways, plays a major role in vulnerability.   Observed increases in heavy precipitation and extreme coastal water levels have increased the risk of river and coastal flooding in many European regions.   In the absence of additional adaptation, the projected increases in extreme precipitation events and in sea level would substantially increase the health risks associated with river and coastal flooding in Europe.     floods climate deaths   CLIM CLIM046 046,Past trends Most regions in Europe have exhibited an increasing trend in heavy precipitation over recent decades, in particular in winter. The number of large inland floods in Europe has been increasing since the 1980s; however, there is not yet conclusive evidence that climate change has already contributed to this trend [i]. Estimates for the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region based on a combination of data from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) and the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) indicate that coastal and inland floods killed more than 2000 people and affected 8.7million in the period 20002014. Figure 1 shows the number of deaths related to flooding in each European Environment Agency (EEA) member and cooperating country for the same period, normalised by their population. The largest numbers are found in south-eastern Europe, eastern Europe and central Europe. Note that, because of the relatively short time period of 15years, the value of the indicator can be significantly affected by a single catastrophic event. For example, at least 50people were killed in massive floods in the Balkan countries in May 2014 [ii]. The EM-DAT database also includes data on people injured or (otherwise) affected by floods. This information is not presented here owing to concerns regarding the consistency with which these data are assessed and reported across countries and even for different flood events in the same country. Projections Heavy precipitation events are likely to become more frequent in many regions in Europe, and sea level rise is projected to accelerate compared with the 20th century under all emissions scenarios. The PESETAII project and the ClimateCost project have estimated the economic and health effects of river and coastal flooding under various climate change scenarios, including sea level rise. For a medium emissions scenario (IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B) and in the absence of adaptation, river flooding is estimated to affect about 300000 people per year in the EU by the 2050s and 390000 people by the 2080s; the latter figure corresponds to more than a doubling with respect to the baseline period (19611990). The British Isles, western Europe and northern Italy show a robust increase in future flood hazards; these regions also show the greatest increase in the population affected by river floods [iii]. If no additional adaptation measures were taken, the number of people affected by coastal flooding in the EU at the end of the 21st century would range from 775000 to 5.5 million people annually, depending on the emissions scenario. The number of deaths in the EU due to coastal flooding in the 2080s would increase by 3000, 620 and 150 per year under a high emissions scenario (assuming 88cm sea level rise), the SRES A1B business as usual scenario and the E1 mitigation scenario, respectively. Two-thirds of these deaths would occur in western Europe. Coastal adaptation measures (dikes and beach nourishment) could significantly reduce risks to less than 10deaths per year in 2080 [iv]. Somewhat different estimates were provided in another study [v]. Flooding is also associated with mental health impacts. Coastal flooding in the EU could potentially cause five million additional cases of mild depression annually by the end of the 21st century under a high sea level rise scenario in the absence of adaptation [vi].

"assessment  Forest fires     Fire risk depends on many factors, including climatic conditions, vegetation, forest management practices and other socio-economic factors.   The burnt area in the Mediterranean region increased from 1980 to 2000; it has decreased thereafter.   In a warmer climate, more severe fire weather and, as a consequence, an expansion of the fire-prone area and longer fire seasons are projected across Europe. The impact of fire events is particularly strong in southern Europe.     forest fires climate change impacts scenarios   CLIM CLIM035 035,Past trends The number and extent of forest fires vary considerably from one year to the next, depending on the seasonal meteorological conditions. Some multi-annual periodicity in the burned area trend can also be partially attributed to the dead biomass burning/accumulation cycle typical of the fire-prone regions. The historical trend of the number of fires is difficult to analyse because fire frequency is strongly affected by the significant changes that occurred in past years in the statistical reporting systems of the countries. Historical fire series are available in Europe and are regularly updated within the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). Data availability in EFFIS is not the same for all countries, and time series longer than 25 years are available for only a few countries. Figure 1 shows that the reported fire frequency in the five southern European countries for which long time series are available increased during the 1990s, then stabilised for around one decade, and slightly decreased during recent years. Note that these values cannot be compared across countries because of large differences across countries in the total area and the area at risk. In 2014, a large forest fire severely damaged more than 15000ha of forest land in Vstmanland County, Sweden [i]. Forest fires are also affecting new areas. For example, in 2007, wildfires moved to previously non-fire-prone ecosystems in southern Greece [ii]. Past trends of fire danger have also been analysed by processing series of meteorological fire danger indices, which are routinely used to rate the fire potential owing to weather conditions. The Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) is used in EFFIS to rate the daily fire danger conditions in Europe [iii]. Daily severity values can be averaged over the fire season obtaining a Seasonal Severity Rating (SSR) index. The index is dimensionless and allows objective comparison of fire danger from year to year and from region to region; SSR values above six may be considered in the extreme range. Figure 2 shows the current state, past trend and projections for forest fire danger based on annual SSR values, which have been computed using daily weather data including air temperature, relative humidity, wind and precipitation from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Other driving factors of fire regimes, such as land-use changes or fuel dynamics, are not taken into account by the SSR. The upper left map shows the average SSR values during the period 19812010; the lower left map shows the linear trends over this period, which indicate that there has been a significant increase in forest fire danger in several regions in Europe. Projections Climate change projections suggest substantial warming and increases in the number of droughts, heat waves and dry spells across most of the Mediterranean area and more generally in southern Europe. These projected changes would increase the length and severity of the fire season, the area at risk and the probability of large fires, possibly enhancing desertification [iv]. Figure 2 also includes fire danger projections for projected climate conditions in 20712100 (upper right map: projected state; lower right map: projected change). The results suggest that climate change would lead to a marked increase of fire potential in south-eastern and south-western Europe; in relative terms, the increase in SSR would be particularly strong in western-central Europe [v]. Similar results were obtained for other forest fire indices, such as the FWI [vi]. The PESETAII study has estimated that the burnt area in southern Europe would more than double during the 21st century for a reference climate scenario and increase by nearly 50% for a 2C scenario [vii]. Another study has estimated a potential increase in burnt areas in Europe by about 200% during the 21st century under a high emissions scenario (SRES A2) assuming no adaptation. The forest fire risk could be substantially reduced by additional adaptation measures, such as prescribed burning, fire breaks and behavioural changes [viii].

"assessment  Forest composition and distribution     Range shifts in forest tree species due to climate change have been observed towards higher altitudes and latitudes. These changes considerably affect the forest structure and the functioning of forest ecosystems and their services.   Future climate change and increasing CO2 concentrations are expected to affect site suitability, productivity, species composition and biodiversity. In general, forest growth is projected to increase in northern Europe and to decrease in southern Europe, but with substantial regional variation. Cold-adapted coniferous tree species are projected to lose large fractions of their ranges to more drought-adapted broadleaf species.   The projected changes will have an impact on the goods and services that forests provide. For example, the value of forest land in Europe is projected to decrease between 14 and 50 % during the 21st century.     changes in habitat suitability plant functional type composition forest trees climate change     CLIM CLIM034 034,Past trends Trees are slow-migrating species. Range expansion occurs primarily into newly suitable habitats at their (generally northern) latitudinal or (upper) altitudinal limit. Range contraction occurs primarily at the rear edge, which is often the most southern or the lowest lying part of their distribution range. These areas can become unsuitable for tree species as a result of direct effects (e.g. drought) or indirect effects (e.g. drought-induced pests or diseases) of climate change. In France, the altitudinal distribution of 171 forest plant species along the elevation range 02600m was studied using a 101-year data record starting in 1905. Climate warming has resulted in a significant upwards shift in species optimum elevation averaging 29m per decade, but with a wide range from +238 to 171m per decade [i]. Land-use changes are the most likely explanation of the observed significant downwards shifts in some regions [ii]. In the Montseny mountain range in north-east Spain, the altitude range of beech extended by about 70m upwards according to different data sources from the 1940s to 2001 [iii]. A study comparing data from the 1990s with data from the 2000s in the Spanish Pyrenees and the Iberian Peninsula found an average optimum elevation shift of 31m upwards per decade for five tree species, ranging between 34 and +181m per decade [iv]. Nevertheless, not all studies found clear climate signals, partly because tree species can experience time lags in their migration response to climate change [v]. In addition to range shifts, changes in forest composition have been observed in the past. In a Swedish sprucebeech forest, a long-term study covering the period since 1894 showed that spruce has been losing its competitive advantage over beech since 1960 [vi]. In north-east Spain, beech forests and heather heathlands have been replaced by holm oak forest at medium altitudes (8001400m), mainly as a result of the combination of warming temperatures and land-use change [vii]. Field-based observations from a forest inventory providing presence and absence information from 1880 to 2010 for a Mediterranean holm oak species (Quercus ilex) have been used to investigate the migration speed in the past. In four studied forests in France along the Atlantic coast, Quercus ilex has colonised a substantial amount of new space, but the northwards movement occurred at an unexpected low maximum rate of 22 to 57m/year across the four forests [viii]. Extreme climate and weather events such as droughts can have negative effects on food webs and regional tree dieback For the Iberian Peninsula, the defoliation of trees due to a water deficit rose significantly between 1987 and 2007 in all 16 examined tree species. Defoliation doubled on average, and this trend was paralleled by significant increases in tree mortality rates in drier areas [ix]. Furthermore, droughts can lead to secondary impacts on forests through pests and pathogens [x]. Projections Climate change is expected to strongly affect the biological and economic viability of different tree species in Europe, as well as competition between tree species. A study in Finland showed that climate change may lead to a local reduction of forest growth but total forest growth nationwide may increase by 44% during the 21st century [xi]. Observations and simulations of tree mitigation rates suggest that only fast-growing, early successional tree species will be able to track climate change [xii]. Recent studies that simulated forest composition and range shifts in Europe and at the global level using different climate and land-use scenarios suggest upwards shifts in the tree line and northwards migration of boreal forests [xiii]. Broadleaf tree cover in Europe is projected to increase during the 21st century under all climate scenarios, whereas needleleaf tree cover decreases, despite a northward extension in northern Europe (Figure 1). A large-scale integrated project on adaptive forest management (MOTIVE) applied an array of models (empirical as well as hybrid and process-based) in the analysis of the impacts of climate change on 38 European tree species. The results show that more drought-tolerant species such as sessile oak (Quercus petraea), pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) can be expected to become more abundant at lower altitudes throughout Europe, while other species such as beech (Fagus sylvatica), sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), lime (Tilia), elm (Ulmus) or silver fir (Abies alba) are likely to see further reductions in their ranges. Species from (sub-)Mediterranean regions such as holm oak (Quercus ilex), hop hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia) and cork oak (Quercus suber) are expected to extend their ranges to the north. Different pine species are also expected to extend their ranges quite considerably. Some species, such as Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), might face indirect threats from insects and other pest outbreaks, rather than direct threats from climate change alone. In summary, the projected range shifts will affect the forest structure quite considerably. Such changes will also affect the functioning of forest ecosystems and the services these ecosystems could provide [xiv]. Another modelling study assessed the impacts of projected climate change on forest composition across Europe and the economic consequences in terms of annual productivity and land value [xv]. It projected that the major commercial tree species in Europe, Norway spruce, will shifts northwards and to higher altitudes. It will lose large parts of its present range in central, eastern and western Europe under all scenarios (SRES A1B, A1FI and B2). Depending on the emissions scenario and climate model, between 21 and 60% (mean: 34%) of European forest lands were projected to be suitable only for a forest type of Mediterranean oak, with low economic returns by 2100, compared with 11% in the baseline period 19611990. As a result of the decline of economically valuable species, the value of forest land in Europe is projected to decrease between 14 and 50% (mean: 28% for an interest rate of 2%) by 2100. The economic loss in land estimation value is estimated at several hundred billion euros.    [i] J.

"assessment  Distribution shifts of plant and animal species     Observed climate change is having significant impacts on the distribution of European flora and fauna, with distribution changes of several hundred kilometres projected over the 21st century. These impacts include northwards and uphill range shifts, as well as local and regional extinctions of species.   The migration of many species is lagging behind the changes in climate owing to intrinsic limitations, habitat use and fragmentation, and other obstacles, suggesting that they are unable to keep pace with the speed of climate change. Observed and modelled differences between actual and required migration rates may lead to a progressive decline in European biodiversity.   Climate change is likely to exacerbate the problem of invasive species in Europe. As climatic conditions change, some locations may become more favourable to previously harmless alien species, which then become invasive and have negative impacts on their new environments.   Climate change is affecting the interaction of species that depend on each other for food or other reasons. It can disrupt established interactions but also generate novel ones.     bumblebee areas biodiversity climate change bumblebee butterflies birds      CLIM CLIM022 022,Past trends A wide variety of plant and animal species in Europe have moved northwards and uphill during recent decades. Mountain top floras across Europe have shown significant changes in species composition between 2001 and 2008, with cold-adapted species decreasing and warm-adapted species increasing in number [i]. On average, most species have moved uphill. These shifts have had opposing effects on the species richness of summit floras in boreal-temperate mountain regions (+3.9 species on average) and Mediterranean mountain regions (1.4 species) [ii]. Data from Switzerland collected over an altitudinal range of 2500m over a short period of eight years (20032010) revealed significant shifts in communities of vascular plants towards warm-dwelling species at lower altitudes. However, rates of community changes decreased with altitude [iii]. There is further evidence of increases in the distribution range due to climate change for several plant species [iv]. The distributions of many terrestrial animals have recently shifted to higher elevations. In Britain, the distributions of spiders, ground beetles, butterflies, grasshoppers and allies have shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11m per decade, and to higher latitudes at a rate of 17km per decade, but with substantial variability across and within taxonomic groups [v]. These range shifts are partly attributable to observed changes in climatic conditions, but land-use and other environmental changes also play a role [vi]. A study in the Netherlands covering the period between 1932 and 2004 found that half of the investigated bird species were overwintering significantly closer to their breeding site than in the past, most likely due to warmer winters [vii]. A long-term trend analysis of 110 common breeding birds across Europe (19802005, 20 countries) showed that species with the lowest thermal maxima showed the sharpest declining trends in abundance [viii]. In other words, cold-adapted species are losing territory most quickly. Observations for most species show an expansion at the leading edge (i.e. by expanding the range northwards and/or uphill), whereas there is less evidence for contractions at the trailing edge (i.e. at the southern margins). However, bumblebees, which are an important pollinator for agricultural and natural ecosystems, showed a different response to the observed warming in recent decades. They suffered from strong range contractions at their southern margins of up to 300km in southern Europe during the last 40 years, but failed to expand northwards, thereby experiencing a substantial compression of their range [ix]. The Community Temperature Index (CTI) is a measure of the rate of change in community composition in response to temperature change. As the CTI increases, butterfly communities become increasingly composed of species associated with warmer temperatures. For example, the CTI of butterfly communities across Europe has increased by 0.14C per decade from 1970 to 2007. However, temperature has increased by 0.39C per decade in the same period, that is, almost three times faster than the butterfly community could move northwards [x]. The finding that the movement of animal species is unable to keep pace with climate change has been confirmed in an analysis of the CTI of several thousand local bird and butterfly communities across Europe (see Figure 1) [xi]. A comprehensive review study on amphibians and reptiles found that 20 out of the 21 amphibian and four out of the five reptilian species assessed in Europe were already affected by climate change. The reported effects were negative, mainly through population declines, reductions in habitat suitability, and reduced survival and range sizes, in more than 90% for amphibians and in more than 60% for reptiles [xii]. A review study on ducks (Anatidae), which are major elements of wetland biodiversity, reports shifts in winter distribution range and phenology. Nevertheless, a phenological mismatch between the periods of peak energy requirements for young and peak seasonal food availability was not found in general with regard to ducks [xiii]. The contribution of the Arctic to global biodiversity is substantial, as the region supports globally significant populations of birds, mammals and fish. The Arctic Species Trend Index (ASTI) has been tracking trends in 306 Arctic species. An analysis of the ASTI over 34 years (19702004) has shown that the abundance of High Arctic vertebrates declined by 26% whereas Low Arctic vertebrate species increased in abundance. Sub-Arctic species did not show a trend over the whole time period, but seem to have declined since the mid-1980s [xiv]. There is some evidence that climate change has already played a role in the spread of alien animal species in Europe. Projections The observed northwards and uphill movement of many plant and animal species is projected to continue in the current century. Threatened endemic species with specific requirements of the ecotope or a small distribution range will generally be at greatest risk, in particular if they face migration barriers [xv]. A modelling study comprising 150 high-mountain plant species across the European Alps projects average range size reductions of 4450% by the end of the 21st century [xvi]. An assessment of the impacts of climate change on 2632 plant species across all major European mountain ranges under four future climate scenarios projected that habitat loss by 20702100 will be greater for species distributed at higher elevations [xvii]. Depending on the climate scenario, up to 3655% of Alpine plant species, 3151% of sub-Alpine plant species and 1946% of montane plant species are projected to lose more than 80% of their suitable habitat. Nevertheless, at the finer scale, microclimate heterogeneity may enable species to persist under climate change in so called micro-climatic refugia [xviii]. A Europe-wide study of the stability of 856 plant species under climate change indicated that the mean stable area of species decreases significantly in Mediterranean scrubland, grassland and warm mixed forests [xix]. The rate of climate change is expected to exceed the ability of many plant species to migrate, especially as landscape fragmentation may restrict movement [xx]. A recent study has analysed the likely shifts in distribution for 3048 plants and animals in England. Of those species, 640 (21%) were classified as being at high risk owing to the loss of substantial parts of their current distributions as a result of a 2C rise in global temperatures [xxi]. Animals generally have a greater capacity than plants to escape unfavourable climatic conditions because of their greater mobility, but they are also affected by climate change. A study based on bioclimatic envelope modelling for 120 native terrestrial European mammals under two climate scenarios showed that 1% or 59% of European mammals risk extinction [xxii]. Another study simulated phylogenetic diversity for plants, birds and mammals in an ensemble of forecasts for 2020, 2050 and 2080 [xxiii]. The results show that the tree of life faces a homogenisation across the continent as a result of a reduction in phylogenetic diversity in southern Europe (where immigration from northern Africa was not considered) and gains in high latitudes and altitudes. The limited dispersal ability of many reptiles, amphibians and butterflies, combined with the fragmentation of habitats, is very likely to reduce and isolate the ranges of many of those species [xxiv]. A study on the effects of projected climate change on 181 terrestrial mammals in the Mediterranean region projected average declines in species ranges between 11 and 45%, depending on the climate scenario and assumptions regarding dispersal [xxv]. Under a scenario of 3C warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100, the ranges of European breeding birds are projected to shift by about 550km to the north-east, whereby average range size would be reduced by 20%. Arctic, sub-Arctic and some Iberian species are projected to suffer the greatest range losses [xxvi]. A comprehensive assessment simulated the current climatic niche and future climatically suitable conditions for almost all European bumblebee species based on over one million records from the STEP projectand three climate change scenarios for the years 2050 and 2100 (see Figure 2). The number of species on the verge of extinction by 2100 ranges from three (5% of assessed species) under the lowest climate scenario to 25 (45% of species) under the highest scenario; under the highest scenario, 53 out of 56 assessed species (95%) would lose the main part of their suitable habitat [xxvii]. The risk of exposure to extreme climates was investigated using four global circulation model outputs and three emissions scenarios. In total, 1149 species were simulated (104 amphibians, 248 reptiles, 288 mammals and 509 breeding birds). The results showed that the main hotspots of biodiversity for terrestrial vertebrates may be significantly influenced by climate change, with a regional hotspot in the Mediterranean [xxviii]. In the Arctic and sub-Arctic, warmer and wetter future conditions allow a considerable number of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and birds to expand their distribution range. However, various species (especially habitat specialists) are expected to contract their range over time. Furthermore, a number of new species are predicted to be able to invade the region, altering community composition and biotic interactions in ways difficult to anticipate [xxix]. As the climatic conditions of some locations in Europe change, they may become more favourable to the establishment and survival of alien species, making native species, communities and ecosystems more vulnerable [xxx]. On the other hand, climate change may also offer some opportunities to control alien species that are predicted to suffer from climate change. Whereas some components of global change, such as rising CO2, usually promote invasion, other components, such as changing temperature and precipitation, can help or hinder plant invasion. Therefore, in some cases climate change can offer unprecedented opportunities for restoration of species distribution.

"assessment  Phenology of plant and animal species     The timing of seasonal events has changed across Europe. A general trend towards earlier spring phenological stages (spring advancement) has been shown in many plant and animal species, mainly due to changes in climate conditions.   As a consequence of climate-induced changes in plant phenology, the pollen season starts on average 10 days earlier than it did and is longer than it was in the 1960s.   The life cycles of many animal groups have advanced in recent decades, with events occurring earlier in the year, including frogs spawning, birds nesting and the arrival of migrant birds and butterflies. This advancement is attributed primarily to a warming climate.   The breeding season of many thermophilic insects (such as butterflies, dragonflies and bark beetles) has been lengthening, allowing, in principle, more generations to be produced per year.   The observed trends are expected to continue into the future. However, simple extrapolations of current phenological trends may be misleading because the observed relationship between temperature and phenological events may change in the future.     species specific trends CLIM CLIM023 023,Past trends A variety of studies show that there has been a general trend for plant, fungi and animal species to advance their springtime phenology over the past 2050 years [i]. An analysis of 315 species of fungi in England showed that, on average, they increased their fruiting season from 33 to 75 days between 1950 and 2005 [ii]. Furthermore, climate warming and changes in the temporal allocation of nutrients to roots seem to have caused significant numbers of plant species to begin fruiting in spring as well as autumn. A study on 53 plant species in the United Kingdom found that they have advanced leafing, flowering and fruiting on average by 5.8 days between 1976 and 2005 [iii]. Similarly, 29 perennial plant species in Spain have advanced leaf unfolding on average by 4.8 days, with first flowering having advanced by 5.9 days and fruiting by 3.2 days over the period 19432003, whereas leaf senescence was delayed on average by 1.2 days [iv]. For plants, a medium spring advancement of four to five days per 1C increase has been observed in Europe [v]. Short warm and cold spells also can have a significant effect on phenological events, but this depends strongly on their timing and the species [vi]. Remote sensing data can support the estimation of the trend of phenological phases over large areas. Continental-scale change patterns have been derived from time series of satellite-measured phenological variables (19822006) [vii]. North-eastern Europe showed a trend towards an earlier and longer growing season, particularly in the northern Baltic areas. Despite the earlier leafing, large areas of Europe exhibited a rather stable season length, indicating that the entire growing season has shifted to an earlier period. The northern Mediterranean displayed on average a shift in the growing season towards later in the year, while some instances of earlier and shorter growing seasons were also seen. The correlation of phenological time series with climate data shows a cause-and-effect relationship over the semi-natural areas. In contrast, managed ecosystems have a heterogeneous change pattern with less or no correlation with climatic trends. Over these areas, climatic trends seemed to overlap in a complex manner, with more pronounced effects of local biophysical conditions and/or land management practices. One study demonstrated that the growing season was starting earlier between 2001 and 2011 for the majority of temperate deciduous forests in western Europe, with the most likely cause being regional spring warming effects experienced during the same period [viii]. A combination of ground observations and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) both indicated that spring phenology significantly advanced during the period 19822011 in central Europe. The average trend of 4.5 days advancement per decade was not uniform and weakened over the last decade investigated, where ground observations and NDVI observations showed different trends (see Figure 1). One possible explanation for the weakening trend from 2000 to 2010 is the response of early spring species to the cooling trend in late winter during that time frame [ix]. However, while individual studies find good agreement between in situ observations and experimental warming, a meta-analysis [x] suggests that experiments can substantially under predict advances in the timing of flowering and leafing of plants in comparison with observational studies. The phenology of numerous animals has advanced significantly in response to recent climate change [xi]. Several studies have convincingly demonstrated that the life-cycle traits of animals are strongly dependent on ambient temperatures, in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats [xii]. Mostly, the observed warming leads to an advanced timing of life history events. For example, temporal trends for the appearance dates of two insect species (honey bee, Apis mellifera, and small white butterfly, Pieris rapae) in more than 1000 localities in Spain have closely followed variations in recorded spring temperatures between 1952 and 2004 [xiii]. The predicted egg-laying date for the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) showed significant advancement between 1980 and 2004 in western and central Europe, but delays in northern Europe, both trends depending on regional temperature trends in the relevant season [xiv]. Data from four monitoring stations in south to mid-Norway of nest boxes of the pied flycatcher from 1992 to 2011 show, contrary to the regional temperature estimated trends, that there were no significant delays in the egg-laying date for the pied flycatcher, but there was an annual fluctuation, making a rather flat curve for the median over these years [xv]. Two studies on Swedish butterfly species showed that the average advancement of the mean flight date was 3.6 days per decade since the 1990s [xvi]. Of the 66 investigated butterfly species, 57 showed an advancement of the mean flight date, which was significant for 45 species. A study from the United Kingdom found that each of the 44 species of butterfly investigated advanced its date of first appearance since 1976 [xvii]. A study indicated that average rates of phenological change have recently accelerated in line with accelerated warming trends [xviii]. There is also increasing evidence about climate-induced changes in spring and autumn migration, including formerly migratory bird species becoming resident [xix]. Warmer temperatures shorten the development period of European pine sawfly larvae (Neodiprion sertifer), reducing the risk of predation and potentially increasing the risk of insect outbreaks, but interactions with other factors, including day length and food quality, may complicate this prediction [xx]. Warmer temperatures also extend the growing season. This means that plants need more water to keep growing or they will dry out, increasing the risk of failed crops and wildfires. The shorter, milder winters that follow might fail to kill dormant insects, increasing the risk of large, damaging infestations in subsequent seasons. For climate change factors other than temperature, the phenology of emissions of volatile compounds from flowers seems affected not only by warming or drought but also by the phenological changes in the presence of pollinators. Nevertheless, experimental evidence suggests that phenological effects on pollinatorplant synchrony may be of limited importance [xxi]. Projections Phenology is primarily seen as an indicator to observe the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and their constituent species. However, an extrapolation of the observed relationship between temperature and phenological events into the future can provide an initial estimate of future changes in phenology. Plants and animal species unable to adjust their phenological behaviour will be negatively affected, particularly in highly seasonal habitats [xxii]. Obviously, there are limits to possible changes in phenology, beyond which ecosystems have to adapt by changes in species composition. For six dominant European tree species, flushing is expected to advance in the next decades, but this trend substantially differed between species (from 0 to 2.4 days per decade) [xxiii]. Interestingly, the projected advancement is quite similar to the recently observed rates and does not increase, as could have been expected from increasingly rising temperatures. This might indicate some physiological limitations in temporal adaptation to climate change. Leaf senescence of two deciduous species, which is more difficult to predict, is expected to be delayed by 1.4 to 2.3 days per decade. Earlier spring leafing and later autumn senescence are likely to affect the competitive balance between species. Species unable to adjust their phenological behaviour will be negatively affected, particularly in highly seasonal habitats. For instance, many late-succession temperate trees require a chilling period in winter, followed by a threshold in day length, and only then are sensitive to temperature. As a result, simple projections of current phenological trends may be misleading, as the relative importance of influencing factors can change [xxiv]. Projections for animal phenology are mainly carried out for species of high economic interest [xxv]. Quantitative projections are hampered by the high natural variability in phenological data, particularly in insects [xxvi]. The projected future warming is expected to cause further shifts in animal phenology, with both positive and negative impacts on biodiversity. For example, increasing spring temperatures may have positive fitness effects in sand lizard populations in Sweden [xxvii]. Nevertheless, climate change can lead to an increase of trophic mismatching, unforeseeable outbreaks of species, a decrease of specialist species and changes in ecosystem functioning [xxviii]. A recent study suggests that many pollinator species are not threatened by phenological decoupling from specific flowering plants [xxix]. Other studies simulated the consequences of the phenological shifts in plantpollinator networks and found that the breadth of the diet of pollinators might decrease because of the reduced overlap between plants and pollinators and that extinctions of plants, pollinators and their crucial interactions could be expected as consequences of these disruptions. Empirical evidence shows that climate change over the last 120 years has resulted in phenological shifts that caused interaction mismatches between flowering plants and bee pollinators. As a consequence, many bee species were extirpated from this system, potentially as a result of climate-induced phenological shifts. Although the plantpollinator interaction networks are quite flexible, redundancy has been reduced, interaction strengths have weakened and pollinator service has declined [xxx].   [i] Benjamin I.

"assessment  Water temperature     Water temperatures in major European rivers have increased by 13 C over the last century. Several time series show increasing lake and river temperatures all over Europe since the early 1900s.   Lake and river surface water temperatures are projected to increase further with projected increases in air temperature.   Increased water temperature can result in marked changes in species composition and functioning of aquatic ecosystems.     climate change impacts rivers and lake temperature  CLIM CLIM019 019,Past trends The surface water temperatures of major rivers in Europe have increased by 13C over the last century (Figure 1). For example, the average temperature in the Rhine near Basel, Switzerland, has risen by more than 2C since the 1960s [i]. The temperature of the downstream part of the Rhine increased by nearly 3C between 1910 and 2013. A similar increase of 2.4C has been observed in the Meuse. Two-thirds of the increase of the downstream part of the Rhine is attributed to the increased use of cooling water and one-third is attributed to the increase in air temperature as a result of climate change [ii]. The annual average temperature of the Danube increased by around by 1C during the 20th century [iii]. Increases in surface water temperature were also found in lakes. Lake Vrtsjrv in Estonia had a 0.7C increase between 1947 and 2014, and the summer (August) water temperature of Lake Saimaa, Finland, increased by more than 1C over the last century (Figure 1). Many other time series indicate a general trend of increasing water temperature in European rivers and lakes in the range of 0.05 to 0.8C per decade, with some water bodies warming by more than 1C per decade [iv]. Projections Inland surface water temperatures are projected to increase further, in parallel with the projected increases in air temperature. The exact amount of warming depends on the magnitude of air temperature increase, on the region, on the season and on lake properties and river catchment. An average increase in summer surface water temperature of 2C (1.22.9C) by 2050 has been estimated for 15 Austrian lakes, depending on the present thermal regime and geographical region [v]. A global study estimated that mean river water temperatures of major European rivers will increase by 1.62.1C during the 21st century (20712100 relative to 19712000, mean of a General circulation model (GCM) ensemble driven by IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 and B1 scenarios) [vi]. A detailed assessment for the Rhine gives an estimated increase in mean annual and August temperature in the range of 3.03.5C during the 21st century, due to climate change. The number of days with water temperatures above 25C, which is the threshold for significant stress to river fauna and flora, would increase at least five-fold (e.g. from 215 days in the reference period 20012010 to 3275 days in 20712100) [vii].

"assessment  River floods     Almost 1 500 floods have been reported for Europe since 1980, of which more than half have occurred since 2000.   The number of very severe flood events in Europe increased over the period 19802010, but with large interannual variability. This increase has been attributed to better reporting, land-use changes and increased heavy precipitation in parts of Europe, but it is not currently possible to quantify the importance of these factors.   Global warming is projected to intensify the hydrological cycle and increase the occurrence and frequency of flood events in large parts of Europe.   Pluvial floods and flash floods, which are triggered by intense local precipitation events, are likely to become more frequent throughout Europe. In regions with projected reduced snow accumulation during winter, the risk of early spring flooding could decrease. However, quantitative projections of changes in flood frequency and magnitude remain highly uncertain.     climate change impacts floods projections river floods rcp0.5     CLIM CLIM017 017,Past trends Figure 1 shows that the number of very severe flood events in Europe increased over the period 19802010, but with large interannual variability. The underlying data is obtained from a combination of information available in global databases such as the Dartmouth Flood Observatory([1]) and the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED)([2]), data reported by EU Member States under the EU Floods Directive and an additional country consultation in all EEA member and cooperating countries [i]. Less extreme events or events with small spatial extent are not included, but the combination of data sources still leads to a large improvement over an overview based on global data sources only. Furthermore, selection of larger floods only (here with severity class very high) is expected to reduce the reporting bias [ii]. For comparison, the NatCatSERVICE database in total contains more than 1200 flood events that have happened since 1990, which, on average, is over 50 per year. Losses from flooding in Europe have increased substantially since the 1970s [iii]. In recent years, some flood events have been so much stronger than previous events that they have led to significant changes in flood risk estimation methods for that region, e.g. in the United Kingdom [iv]. The trend for increasing losses from river floods is primarily attributable to socio-economic factors, such as increasing wealth located in flood zones, but increases in heavy precipitation in parts of Europe may also play a role. Robust attribution is not yet possible because of insufficient data [v]. In terms of regional GDP, flood risks are highest in large parts of eastern Europe, Scandinavia, Austria and the United Kingdom and parts of France and Italy [vi]. A shift from a purely technically oriented flood defense toward a more integrated flood risk management system that also considers nonstructural measures to minimize adverse effects of flooding has led to more effective flood management and to a reduction of damage caused by the 2013 floods in Germany, compared to the 2002 floods [vii]. Projections Future changes in the risk of river floods in Europe have been simulated using a hydrological model driven by an ensemble of climate simulations [viii]. Of particular interest is the frequency analysis of flood peaks above the 100-year flood level, which is the average protection level of the European river network (albeit with significant differences) [ix]. Figure 2 shows the change in the level of one-in-a-century (Q100) floods between the reference period and three future time periods based on the hydrological model LISFLOOD and an ensemble of seven climate models [x]. Blue rivers indicate an increase in flood level and red rivers indicate a decrease. For the end of the 21st century, the greatest increase in Q100 floods is projected for the British Isles, north-west and south-east France, northern Italy and some regions in south-east Spain, the Balkans and the Carpathians. Mild increases are projected for central Europe, the upper section of the Danube and its main tributaries. In contrast, decreases in Q100 floods are projected in large parts of north-eastern Europe owing to a reduction in snow accumulation, and hence melt-associated floods, under milder winter temperatures. These results are consistent with earlier studies [xi]. While the ensemble mean presented in Figure 2 provides the best assessment of all model simulations together, individual simulations can show important differences from the ensemble mean for individual catchments. This is partly the result of significant decadal-scale internal variability in the simulated climate [xii]. Furthermore, the LISFLOOD analysis is restricted to the larger rivers in Europe, which may not be representative of a whole country or region. For example, in northern Europe, rainfall-dominated floods in smaller rivers may increase because of projected increases in precipitation amounts, even where snowmelt-dominated floods in large rivers are projected to decrease [xiii]. Changes in flood frequencies below the protection level are expected to have less significant economic effects and affect fewer people than even small changes in the largest events (e.g. with a return period of 500years). For a number of European river basins, including the Po, Duero, Garonne, Ebro, Loire, Rhine and Rhone, an increase in extreme floods with a return period above 500 years is projected; this includes river basins such as Guadiana and Narva, where the overall frequency of flood events is projected to decline [xiv]. A follow-up study combined the results of this flood hazard assessment with detailed exposure maps to estimate the economic and health risks from river floods in Europe. The results suggest that a high climate change scenario could increase the socio-economic impact of floods in Europe more than three-fold by the end of the 21st century. The strongest increase in flood risk is projected for Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia [xv]. A combination of different adaptation measures has been estimated to reduce economic damage from (fluvial and coastal) floods substantially by 67 to 99% and reduce the number of people flooded by 37 to 99% for the 100-year event [xvi].

"assessment  River flow     Available studies suggest that run-off in near-natural rivers during the period 19632000 increased in western and northern Europe, in particular in winter, and decreased in southern and parts of eastern Europe, in particular in summer. However, comprehensive observation data on river flows are not available across Europe.   Long-term trends in river flows due to climate change are difficult to detect because of substantial interannual and decadal variability, as well as modifications to natural water flows arising from water abstractions, morphological changes (such as man-made reservoirs) and land-use changes.   Climate change is projected to result in significant changes in the seasonality of river flows across Europe. Summer flows are projected to decrease in most of Europe, including in regions where annual flows are projected to increase. Where precipitation shifts from snow to rain, spring and summer peak flow will shift to earlier in the season.     change in river flow change in streamflow climate change   CLIM CLIM016 016,Past trends Human interventions in catchments, including water abstractions, river regulation and land-use change, have considerably altered river flow regimes in large parts of Europe, making it difficult to discern any climate-driven changes in river flow data. An inventory of river flows in Europe was produced by combining over 400 time series (from 1962 to 2004) of river catchments with near-natural flow conditions for Europe and an ensemble of eight large-scale hydrological models (for 19632000) [i]. According to this inventory, run-off showed positive trends in western and northern Europe and negative trends in southern and parts of eastern Europe (Figure 1). The European pattern of annual run-off trends modelled by the ensemble mean shows a regionally coherent picture. The areas where models disagreed on the trend direction were largely located in areas of weak trends, notably in the transition areas between regions with consistent negative and positive trends. The pattern of changes in regional high flows is very similar to the pattern of changes in annual flows, whereas summer low flows have also decreased in various regions where annual flows have increased. Overall, positive trends in annual stream flow appear to reflect the marked wetting trends of the winter months, whereas negative annual trends result primarily from a widespread decrease in stream flow in spring and summer months, consistent with a decrease in summer low flow in large parts of Europe. The model uncertainties were largest in complex terrain with high spatial variability and in snow-dominated regimes. The magnitude of the observed seasonal changes clearly raises concerns for water resource management both today and in future decades. To date, however, despite the evidence of changes in the seasonality of flows, there is no conclusive evidence that low river flows have generally become more severe or frequent in Europe during recent decades [ii]. Whereas many studies detect significant hydrological changes in observed datasets, more scientific rigour is needed in the attribution of river flow changes, as these studies often fall short in proving and quantifying the relationship between these changes and potential drivers [iii]. Projections Annual river flows are projected to decrease in southern and south-eastern Europe and increase in northern and north-eastern Europe [iv]. Changes are projected in the seasonality of river flows, with large differences across Europe. For most parts of Europe, the peak of the average daily flow at the end of the 21st century is projected to occur earlier in the year than currently [v]. In snow-dominated regions, such as the Alps, Scandinavia and parts of the Baltic, the reduction in winter retention as snow, earlier snowmelt and, in some cases, reduced summer precipitation are projected to lead to increases in river flows in winter and reductions in summer [vi]. Reductions of flow can be exacerbated by water abstractions, especially in summer when consumption is highest and input is typically low. These changes result in a further decrease of water availability in summer (see Figure 2) [vii].   [i] K.

"assessment  Ocean oxygen content      Dissolved oxygen in sea water affects the metabolism of species. Therefore, reductions in oxygen content (i.e. hypoxic or anoxic areas) can lead to changes in the distribution of species, including so called dead zones.   Globally, oxygen-depleted areas have expanded very rapidly in recent decades. The number of dead zones has roughly doubled every decade since the 1960s and has increased from about 20 in the 1950s to about 400 in the 2000s.   Oxygen-depleted zones in the Baltic Sea have increased more than 10-fold, from 5 000 to 60 000 km 2 , since 1900, with most of the increase happening after 1950. The Baltic Sea now has the largest dead zone in the world. Oxygen depletion has also been observed in other European seas in recent decades.   The primary cause of oxygen depletion is nutrient input from agricultural fertilisers, causing eutrophication. The effects of eutrophication are exacerbated by climate change, in particular increases in sea temperature and in water-column stratification.     eutrophication oxygen-depleted oxygen depletion observed hypoxia baltic sea climate change adaptation      CLIM CLIM054 054,Past trends Dissolved oxygen in marine ecosystems has changed drastically in a very short period compared with other variables of the marine environment. While hypoxic zones occur naturally in some regions, increased nutrient loads from agricultural fertilisers have caused oxygen-depleted areas or even anoxic areas (so-called dead zones) to expand globally since the mid-20th century. The number of dead zones globally has increased from about 20 in the 1950s to about 400 in the 2000s [i]. Extensive areas with oxygen depletion or even anoxic areas have been observed for decades in all European seas (Figure 1) [ii]. The largest area of human-induced hypoxia in Europe, and in fact globally, is found within the Baltic Sea (including the adjacent seas towards the North Sea). The Baltic Sea is a shallow basin with restricted inlets, meaning that the water has a high residence time, making this water body prone to hypoxia. Hypoxic areas in the Baltic Sea have increased more than 10-fold, from 5000 to 60000km2, since 1900, with most of the increase happening after 1950 (Figure 2). This expansion is primarily linked to increased inputs of nutrients from the land, but increased respiration from higher temperatures during the last two decades (since the early 1990s) has contributed to worsening oxygen levels [iii]. Oxygen depletion initially affects benthic organisms (i.e. those living on or in the seabed). Benthic organisms carry out important ecosystem functions, such as bioturbation, bioirrigation and sediment nutrient cycling. Benthic organisms also play a crucial role in the marine food web, so reductions in benthic organisms can have large impacts to commercial fisheries. The loss of benthic macrofauna in the Baltic Sea (including adjacent seas) as a result of hypoxia has been estimated at 3 million tonnes or about 30% of Baltic secondary production [iv]. Projections Sea surface temperature is projected to continue to increase in the Baltic Sea and other European seas. As a result, oxygen-depleted areas will further expand, in particular in the Baltic Sea, unless nutrient intakes are reduced [v]. The combined effects of oxygen loss and ocean warming could force polewards movement and vertical contraction of metabolic viable habitats and species distribution ranges during this century [vi].

"assessment  Distribution shifts of marine species     Increases in regional sea temperatures have triggered a major northwards expansion of warmer water plankton and a northwards retreat of colder water plankton in the North-east Atlantic. This northerly movement has amounted to about 10  latitude (1 100 km) over the past 40 years, and it seems to have accelerated since 2000.   Sub-tropical species are occurring with increasing frequency in Europes seas, and sub-Arctic species are receding northwards.   Wild fish stocks are responding to changing temperatures and food supply by changing their distribution. This can have impacts on those local communities that depend on those fish stocks.   Further changes in the distribution of marine species, including fish stocks, are expected with the projected climate change, but quantitative projections of these distribution changes are not widely available.     climate change CLIM CLIM015 015,Past trends Increases in regional sea temperatures have triggered a major northwards movement of species. As a result, sub-tropical species are occurring with increasing frequency in European waters, and sub-Arctic species are receding northwards. However, in areas with geographical constraints, i.e. where a coastline hinders northwards movement, some species shift into deeper and cooler waters [i]. Some examples are provided below. Plankton in the Greater North Sea have shown a northerly movement of about 10 latitude over the past 40 years. This corresponds to a mean polewards movement of around 250km per decade, which appears to have accelerated since 2000 [ii]. As a result, the ratio of the coldwater Calanus finmarchicus to the warmwater Calanus helgolandicus copepod species has changed considerably over time (Figure 1). While C. helgolandicus is becoming more abundant in the North Sea, the overall Calanus biomass has declined by 70% since the 1960s [iii]. Such rapid shifts in distribution range can reorganise marine species communities and have an impact on human communities that depend on them. For example, it has been shown that occurrences of European sprat are positively correlated with C. finmarchicus, while species such as Atlantic horse mackerel are positively correlated with C. helgolandicus [iv]. Benthic invertebrates are also shifting their distribution range as temperatures change in the Greater North Sea, but their response lags behind the temperature increase. Unless the individual species are able to withstand a change in thermal regime, this mismatch could lead to a drop in benthic diversity [v]. Such reorganisation will have an impact upon human communities and challenge traditional approaches to management of, for example fisheries, which have to consider species responses to temperature when planning future fishing opportunities [vi]. Very fast rates of northwards movement were observed in the coastal waters of southern Norway from 1997 and 2010. About 1600 benthic marine species were found, and of these 565 species had expanded their distribution northwards along the coast, at rates of 500800km per decade [vii]. Phytoplankton and highly mobile pelagic species are the fastest migrating organisms; their migration rate can be an order of magnitude faster than those of terrestrial species [viii]. Increases in the surface temperature of the North Sea in recent decades have triggered establishment of warmwater swimming crabs, which in turn has allowed establishment of colonies of lesser black-backed gulls in Belgium and northern France [ix]. There is also evidence that the overwintering distributions of many water birds have changed. In recent decades, in response to warming, their distributions have shifted northwards and eastwards out of the United Kingdom [x]. In the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the introduction of warmwater and tropical alien species from the Red Sea has been exacerbated by observed warming, leading to a 150% increase in the annual mean rate of species entry after 1998 [xi]. Impacts on fisheries Climate change is also affecting fish stocks of commercial interest. Wild fish stocks seem to be responding to changing temperatures and food supply by changing their geographical distribution and their phenology. Mackerel and horse mackerel are spawning earlier in the English Channel, and both earlier and further north on the Porcupine Bank (off the west coast of Ireland). International commercial landings from the North-east Atlantic Ocean of fish species identified as warm-adapted (e.g. grey gurnard, red mullet and hake) have increased by 250% since the 1980s, while landings of cold-adapted species (e.g. cod, haddock and whiting) have halved [xii]. A striking example for the potentially large economic consequences of the northwards movement of marine species is the recent establishment of the Northeast Atlantic mackerel in Greenlandic waters. This temperature-sensitive epipelagic fish was first observed in Greenlandic waters in 2011, following record-high summer temperatures. Following the rapid development of a large-scale fishery, mackerel already contributed 23% to the export value of all goods from Greenland in 2014 [xiii]. In the North-east Atlantic Ocean, 72% of commonly observed fish species have responded to warming waters by changing their abundance and/or distribution (Figure 2). Traditionally exploited fish species have moved further northwards in the region, while new species have moved in, most likely as a result of a shift in the thermal regime. While warming can lead to an increase in fish biodiversity in a region, there is often a concurrent decrease in the size structure of the fish population. For example, in the Greater North Sea, the relatively small species sprat, anchovy and horse mackerel have increased in recent decades, whereas the larger species cod and plaice have decreased at their southern distribution limit [xiv]. This change may have important socio-economic consequences, as the stocks moving out tend to have a higher value than the stocks moving in. Pronounced changes in community structures and species interactions of demersal fish are projected over the next 50 years, as fish will experience constraints in the availability of suitable habitat [xv]. Global projections of changes in total catch of marine fish and invertebrates in response to ocean warming suggest a large-scale redistribution of global catch potential, with an increase in high-latitude regions and a decline in the tropics. In Europe, a considerable increase in catch potential is expected in the Arctic [xvi]. Projections As sea surface temperatures increase, marine species will continue to seek out the most optimal temperature regime for their metabolic demands, thus leading to further northwards movement of marine species. However, quantitative projections are not widely available. Furthermore, non-indigenous species might become invasive if conditions favour their metabolic demands, while native species are weakened [xvii].   [i] Nicholas K.

"assessment  Sea surface temperature     All European seas have warmed considerably since 1870, and the warming has been particularly rapid since the late 1970s. The multi-decadal rate of sea surface temperature rise during the satellite era (since 1979) has been between 0.21 C per decade in the North Atlantic and 0.40 C per decade in the Baltic Sea.   Globally averaged sea surface temperature is projected to continue to increase, although more slowly than atmospheric temperature.     water water temperature  CSI CSI046 CLIM CLIM013 046 013,Past trends The production of consistent, long time series of SST faces challenges owing to different measurement devices (in situmeasurements from ships and buoys, as well as remote measurements from satellites), associated different definitions (e.g. water depth and time of day of measurement), different bias correction methods, and different interpolation methods to account for incomplete spatial and temporal coverage. As a result, substantially different values for absolute SST and for SST trends may be reported for a particular ocean basin, depending on the underlying global or regional SST dataset. In fact, there is still considerable uncertainty about the trend in global SST for the recent period 19792012 [i]. Furthermore, observed SST trends for regional seas reflect the combined effects of anthropogenic warming and natural climate variability (e.g.Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) [ii]. Despite those uncertainties, it is undisputed that SST has been increasing globally and in Europe during the last century. The current indicator primarily uses information from the Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST1) dataset [iii]. Information on the Mediterranean for the satellite era is complemented by data from the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The trends, although not necessarily the absolute SST levels, are consistent between HadISST1 and available high-resolution SST datasets for the regional seas (Mediterranean Sea, Baltic Sea and North Sea). The trends reported here cannot be directly compared with those in previous versions of this indicator, which used different underlying datasets. All European seas have warmed considerably since 1870, and the warming has been particularly rapid since the late 1970s (Figure 1). The multi-decadal rate of SST rise during the satellite era (19792015) has been between 0.21C per decade in the North Atlantic and 0.40C per decade in the Baltic Sea. Projections It is very likely that globally averaged ocean temperatures at the surface and for different ocean depths will further increase in the near-term and beyond. Owing to the thermal inertia of the ocean, global SST is projected to rise more slowly than atmospheric temperature [iv]. Quantitative SST projections are available only for some regional seas in Europe [v]. For the Baltic Sea, the increase in summer SST during the 21st century under medium to high emissions scenarios is projected to be about 2C in the southern parts and about 4C in the northern parts [vi]. An increase in harmful algal blooms, with increased risks to human health, ecosystems and aquaculture, has been projected for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea as a result of the projected warming [vii].

"assessment  Ocean heat content     The warming of the oceans has accounted for approximately 93 % of the warming of the Earth since the 1950s. Warming of the upper (0700 m) ocean accounted for about 64 % of the total heat uptake.   A trend for increasing heat content in the upper ocean has become evident since the 1950s. Recent observations also show substantial warming of the deeper ocean (between depths of 700 and 2 000 m and below 3 000 m).   Further warming of the oceans is expected with the projected climate change. The amount of warming is strongly dependent on the emissions scenario.     global heat marine ocean   CLIM CLIM044 044,Past trends The warming of the oceans has accounted for approximately 93% of the warming of the Earth since the 1950s [i]. Ocean heat content (OHC) has increased since around 1970 (Figure 1). Differences in the values for yearly and five-yearly averages are the result of the particular method used for spatial gap filling. The linear warming trends of the uppermost 700m of the ocean and the 7002000m layer over the time period 19552013 were 0.27W/m2 and 0.39W/m2 (per unit area of the ocean), respectively. It is likely that the ocean warmed between 700 and 2000m from 1957 to 2014 and between 3000m and the bottom of the ocean from 1992 to 2005, while trends in ocean temperature between depths of 2000 and 3000m were not statistically significant [ii]. Two-thirds of the observed increase in OHC has occurred in the upper 700m of the ocean, with increases in the layers below a depth of 700m accounting for the remaining third. The strongest warming is found near the sea surface, with the upper 75m having warmed by more than 0.1C per decade since 1971. It has been estimated that heat uptake has doubled in recent decades [iii]. At a depth of 700m, the warming decreases to about 0.015C per decade [iv]. Recently, it has been determined that past increases in OHC have been substantially underestimated because of poor sampling of the Southern Hemisphere and limitations of the analysis methods [v]. These concerns have not yet been considered in the datasets presented here. Projections All available ocean temperature projections suggest that the global ocean will continue to warm. The largest warming is projected for the upper few hundred metres of the sub-tropical gyres, similar to the observed pattern of ocean temperature changes. Mixing and advection processes will gradually transfer the additional heat to deeper levels. The rate of increase of OHC is approximately proportional to the global mean change in surface air temperature. Under the low-to-medium (RCP4.5) emissions scenario, half of the energy taken up by the ocean by the end of the 21st century will be by the uppermost 700m, and 85% will be by the uppermost 2000m. Projected ocean warming varies considerably across forcing scenarios. Globally averaged projected surface warming ranges from about 1C for RCP2.6 to more than 3C for RCP8.5 during the 21st century, and at a depth of 1000m ranges from 0.5C for RCP2.6 to 1.5C for RCP8.5[vi].

"assessment  Ocean acidification     Ocean surface pH has declined from 8.2 to below 8.1 over the industrial era as a result of the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This decline corresponds to an increase in oceanic acidity of about 30 %.   Ocean acidification in recent decades has been occurring 100 times faster than during past natural events over the last 55 million years.   Observed reductions in surface water pH are nearly identical across the global ocean and throughout continental European seas, except for variations near the coast. The pH reduction in the northernmost European seas, i.e. the Norwegian Sea and the Greenland Sea, is larger than the global average.   Ocean acidification already reaches into the deep ocean, particularly at the high latitudes.   Models consistently project further ocean acidification worldwide. Ocean surface pH is projected to decrease to values between 8.05 and 7.75 by the end of 21st century, depending on future CO2 emissions levels. The largest projected decline represents more than a doubling in acidity.   Ocean acidification is affecting marine organisms and this could alter marine ecosystems.     climate change acidification ocean acidification   CLIM CLIM043 043,Past trends The annual mean atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 397ppm in 2014, which is 40% above the pre-industrial level (280ppm); half of that increase has occurred since the 1980s. Over the same time period, ocean pH has been reduced from 8.2 to below 8.1, which corresponds to an increase of about 30% in ocean acidity (defined here as the hydrogen ion concentration). This change has occurred at rates ranging between 0.0014 and 0.0024 per year, which is about a hundred times faster than any change in acidity experienced during the last 55million years [i]. The measured reduction in surface pH in the surface mixed layer (depths to 100m) is consistent with that calculated on the basis of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, assuming thermodynamic equilibrium between the ocean surface and the atmosphere [ii]. The northernmost seas, i.e. the Norwegian Sea and the Greenland Sea, have experienced surface water pH reductions of 0.13 and 0.07, respectively, since the 1980s, both of which are larger than the global average [iii]. Figure 1 shows the decline in ocean surface pH over the period 19882014 from a station offshore of Hawaii, for which the longest time series is available [iv]. The changes observed at two other ocean stations suitable for evaluating long-term trends (offshore of the Canary Islands and Bermuda) are very similar [v]. Projections Average surface water pH is projected to decline further to between 8.05 and 7.75 by 2100, depending on future CO2 emissions (Figure 2). Similar declines are also expected for enclosed, coastal seas such as the Baltic Sea [vi]. The largest projected decline represents more than a doubling in acidity [vii]. Surface waters are projected to become seasonally corrosive to aragonite in parts of the Arctic within a decade and in parts of the Southern Ocean within the next three decades in most scenarios. Aragonite is a less stable form of calcium carbonate and under-saturation will become widespread in these regions at atmospheric CO2 levels of 500600ppm [viii]. The waters of the Baltic Sea will also become more acidic before the end of the century [ix]. Such changes affect many marine organisms and could alter marine ecosystems and fisheries. These rapid chemical changes are an added pressure on marine calcifiers and ecosystems of Europes seas. Without substantial reductions in CO2 emissions, recovery from human-induced acidification will require thousands of years for the Earth system to re-establish roughly similar ocean chemical conditions [x] and millions of years for coral reefs to return, based on palaeo-records of natural coral reef extinction events [xi].

"assessment  Glaciers     The vast majority of glaciers in the European glacial regions are in retreat. Glaciers in the European Alps have lost approximately half of their volume since 1900, with clear acceleration since the 1980s.   Glacier retreat is expected to continue in the future. It has been estimated that the volume of European glaciers will decline between 22 and 84 % compared with the current situation by 2100 under a moderate greenhouse gas forcing scenario, and between 38 and 89 % under a high forcing scenario.   Glacier retreat contributed to global sea level rise by about 0.8 mm per year in 20032009. It also affects freshwater supply and run-off regimes, river navigation, irrigation and power generation. Furthermore, it may cause natural hazards and damage to infrastructure.     europe climate change cryosphere mass-balance glaciers     CLIM CLIM007 007,Past trends A general loss of glacier mass since the beginning of the measurements has occurred in all European glacier regions, except some glaciers in Norway (Figure 1). The Alps have lost roughly 50% of their ice mass since 1900 [i]. Norwegian coastal glaciers were expanding and gaining mass up to the end of the 1990s owing to increased winter snowfall on the North Atlantic Coast; now these glaciers are also retreating [ii]. Some ice caps at higher elevations in north-eastern Svalbard, Norway, seem to be increasing in thickness, but estimates for Svalbard as a whole show a declining mass balance [iii]. The centennial retreat of European glaciers is attributed primarily to increased summer temperatures. However, changes in winter precipitation, reduced glacier albedo due to the lack of summer snowfall and various other feedback processes, such as the increasing debris cover on the glacier, can influence the behaviour of glaciers, in particular on regional and decadal scales. The melting of glaciers is contributing significantly to global sea level rise. For the period 20032009, the global contribution was 0.710.08mm per year, accounting for 2913% of the observed sea level rise [iv]. Projections The retreat of European glaciers is projected to continue throughout the 21st century (Figure 2). One study estimates that the volume of European glaciers will decline between 22 and 84% relative to their extent in 2006 under a moderate greenhouse gas forcing scenario (RCP4.5) and between 38 and 89% under a high forcing scenario (RCP8.5) (all European regions combined) [v]. The relative volume loss is largest in central Europe (8310% for RCP4.5 and 954% for RCP8.5). Similar results were achieved in other studies [vi]. In Norway, nearly all smaller glaciers are projected to disappear and, overall, glacier area as well as volume may be reduced by about one-third by 2100, even under the low SRES B2 emissions scenario [vii].

"assessment  Snow cover     Snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere has declined significantly over the past 90 years, with most of the reductions occurring since 1980. Over the period 19672015, snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased by 7 % on average in March and April and by 47 % in June; the observed reductions in Europe are even larger, at 13 % for March and April and 76 % for June.   Snow mass in the Northern Hemisphere is estimated to have decreased by 7 % in March from 1982 to 2009; snow mass in Europe has decreased more rapidly than the average for the Northern Hemisphere, but with large interannual variation.   Model simulations project widespread reductions in the extent and duration of snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere and in Europe over the 21st century.   Changes in snow cover affect the Earths surface reflectivity, water resources, flora and fauna and their ecology, agriculture, forestry, tourism, snow sports, transport and power generation.     climate change cryosphere snow mass snow cover snow cover extent     CLIM CLIM008 008,Past trends Satellite observations of monthly snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere are available from 1967 onwards [i]. A detailed analysis based on multiple sources shows there have been significant decreases in Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent during the spring melt season since about 1980 (March to June; Figure 1, left) [ii]; in other seasons, the snow cover extent has remained stable or even slightly increased. A separate analysis for Europe (EEA-39 region) shows even larger reductions of 13% for March and April, and 76% for June between 1980 and 2015 (Figure 1, right). Decreases in snow cover extent are caused by an earlier onset of melting and a shorter duration of the snow season. Since 1972, the duration of the snow season averaged over the Northern Hemisphere declined by fivedays per decade, but with substantial regional variation. The duration of the snow season has decreased by up to 25days in western, northern and eastern Europe due to earlier spring melt, whereas it has increased by up to 15days in south-eastern Europe due to an earlier onset of the snow season [iii]. The snow mass (i.e. the amount of water that the snow contains) is an important variable, as it affects the role of snow in the hydrological cycle. For the whole of the Northern Hemisphere, a 7% decrease in March snow mass was observed between 1982 and 2009 [iv]. An extension of this data focusing on EEA member countries demonstrates a stronger average decline of 30% for the period 19802015, although the year-to-year variation is large (Figure 2). Winter increases in precipitation have also led to an increase in snow mass at higher altitudes in Norway. Projections Northern Hemisphere snow cover will continue to shrink and snow seasons shorten as temperatures rise [v], although in the coldest regions snowfall can also increase in the middle of winter [vi]. The multi-model mean from the CMIP5 modelling exercise projects changes in March/April snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere during the 21st century ranging from 7% for a low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) to 25% for a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) (Figure 3). The projected snow mass generally follows the snow cover extent with an estimated range of reduction from about 10% for RCP2.6 to about 30% for RCP8.5; projected reductions in the duration of the snow season range from about 10days for RCP2.6 to about 40days for RCP8.5 [vii]. Specific regional studies suggest significant reductions in snow mass in, for example, the Alps in general [viii], Switzerland [ix], the alpine range of Italy [x], the Pyrenees [xi], Norway [xii], the Turkish mountains [xiii] and the Balkan mountains [xiv]. These changes can have dramatic downstream effects as melt water contributes up to 6070% to annual river flows. Despite the projected decrease in long-term mean snow mass in the Northern Hemisphere, model simulations indicate occasional winters of heavy snowfall, but these become increasingly uncommon towards the end of the 21st century.

"assessment  Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets     The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are the largest bodies of ice in the world and play an important role in the global climate system. Both ice sheets have been losing large amounts of ice at an increasing rate since 1992.   The cumulative ice loss from Greenland from 1992 to 2015 was 3 600 Gt and contributed to global sea level rise by approximately 10 mm; the corresponding figure for Antarctica is 1 500 Gt, which corresponds to approximately a 5 mm global sea level rise since 1992.   Model projections suggest further declines of the polar ice sheets in the future, but the uncertainties are large. The melting of the polar ice sheets is estimated to contribute up to 50 cm of global sea level rise during the 21st century. Very long-term projections (until the year 3000) suggest potential sea level rise of several metres with continued melting of the ice sheets.     sea level rise greenland ice sheet cryosphere antarctic ice sheet climate change     CLIM CLIM009 009,Past trends The mass balance of the polar ice sheets is affected by numerous factors, including changes in precipitation patterns over the ice sheets, snowfall, changes in the snowline, summer melting of snow, changes in ice sheet albedo, changes in the extent of supraglacial lakes, submarine melting of the floating ice shelves at the tongue of marine outlet glaciers, and icebergs breaking off of glaciers [i]. The changing balance between ice accumulation, on the one hand, and melting and sublimation of ice and snow, submarine melting and calving, on the other hand, determines the future development of the ice sheets. Both ice sheets have lost significant amounts of ice since 2005 (Figure 1). Several different methods have been used to monitor the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet. The overall conclusion of all available studies is that Greenland is losing mass (Figure 1). Average ice loss increased from 34 (uncertainty interval: 6 to 74) billion tonnes per year over the period 19922001 to 215 (157 to 274) billion tonnes per year over the period 20022011. In 2012, an exceptional loss estimated at more than 500 billion tonnes was recorded. From 1992 to 2012, the contribution to the global sea level has been estimated to have been approximately 8.0mm (6.6 to 9.4mm) [ii]. In 20132015, the net loss of ice was slower than in 2012, with a total of approximately 280 billion tonnes net loss over the period [iii]. In Greenland, the area subject to summer melt has increased significantly over recent decades [iv]. The increased melting has been attributed to changes in general circulation in summer, creating warmer conditions over Greenland [v]. Ice core data suggest that large-scale melting events such as the one observed in 2012 have occurred once every few hundred years on average, with previous ones in 1889 and in the 12th century. It is not currently possible to tell whether the frequency of these rare extensive melt events has changed [vi]. Another important process that may accelerate the loss of ice from the ice sheets is enhanced submarine melting of glaciers terminating in the sea. Its importance may be greater than previously assumed. The process has been documented for both the Greenland and the Antarctic ice sheets [vii]. East Antarctica had a slightly positive mass balance of +14 (29 to +57) billion tonnes per year over the period 19922011, but, overall, the Antarctic ice sheet has lost on average approximately 70 billion tonnes of ice per year, as West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula have lost 65 (39 to 91) and 20 (6 to 34) billion tonnes per year, respectively. The floating ice shelves have also become thinner [viii]. From 1992 to 2015, the ice loss of the Antarctic ice sheet has contributed approximately 5mm (2 to 7mm) to the global sea level [ix]. All in all, the ice sheets have contributed to about one-third of the total sea level rise since the 1990s [x]. A recent study of Antarctica suggests, however, that the snow accumulation has exceeded the mass loss from ice discharge, leading to the equivalent of an annual 0.23mm sea level depletion between 2003 and 2008 [xi]. Projections All recent studies indicate that the mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet will increase the global sea level, with greater radiative forcing leading to greater sea level rise. Recent studies suggest an upper bound of 16cm of sea level rise from the Greenland ice sheet during the 21st century for a high emissions scenario and somewhat lower values for lower emissions scenarios [xii]. One recent study estimated that the Greenland ice sheet contribution until the year 3000 will be 1.4, 2.6 and 4.2m for the emissions scenarios SRES B1, A1B and A2 (with stabilised greenhouse concentrations after 2100), respectively [xiii]. On multi-millennial time scales, the Greenland ice sheet shows threshold behaviour due to different feedback mechanisms. If a temperature above the threshold is maintained for an extended period, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet could self-amplify, which would eventually result in near-complete ice loss (equivalent to a sea level rise of about 7m). Coupled climateice sheet models with a fixed topography (that do not consider the feedback between surface mass balance and the height of the ice sheet) estimate that the global mean surface air temperature threshold above which the Greenland ice will completely melt lies between 2 and 4C above pre-industrial levels [xiv]. In contrast, a study modelling the ice sheet dynamically suggests that the threshold could be as low as about 1C above pre-industrial levels [xv]. The complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet is not inevitable because it has a long time scale. Complete melting would take tens of millennia if near the threshold and a millennium or more for temperatures a few degrees above the threshold [xvi]. The uncertainties around future ice discharge from Antarctica, and the associated sea level rise, are larger than for Greenland. However, mass loss of the Antarctic ice sheet has a greater impact on the sea level in the Northern Hemisphere than a comparable loss of the Greenland ice sheet, owing to gravitational forces. A comprehensive analysis applying various climate, ocean and ice sheet models estimates that the additional ice loss for the 21st century is 7cm (90% range: 023cm) of global sea level equivalent for a low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) and 9cm (90% range: 137cm) for a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) [xvii]. By 2100, the rise of global sea level will be clearly influenced by the development of the Antarctic ice sheet. A recent study suggests that the Antarctic ice sheet has the potential to contribute more than a metre to sea level rise by 2100 and more than 15metres by 2500, if emissions continue unabated [xviii]. Several studies that were published after the release of the IPCCAR5 suggest that melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) has been accelerating recently and that a WAIS collapse is already inevitable and irreversible. There are also indications of instability in some parts of the much larger East Antarctic Ice Sheet. These new results suggest that the global mean sea level contribution from Antarctica alone could be several metres on a time scale of a few centuries to a millennium [xix]. The long-term development of the ice sheets is hugely important in determining the consequences of climate change. Amplifying feedback mechanisms, including slowdown of meridional overturning circulation, may accelerate ice sheet mass loss [xx]. A coupled ice sheetice shelf model suggests that, if atmospheric warming exceeds 1.5 to 2C above present, the major Antarctic ice shelves would collapse, which would trigger a centennial- to millennial-scale response of the Antarctic ice sheet and cause an unstoppable contribution to sea level rise [xxi]. Although current estimates of sea level rise by 2100 suggest that they will fall in a range of some tens of centimetres [xxii], collapsing ice sheets could, in the long term, result in a faster and greater rise in sea level than currently assumed, underlining the urgency of climate change mitigation [xxiii]. The uncertainties in the long-term projections are significant, however. Assumptions concerning, for example, bedrock uplift and sea surface drop associated with ice sheet retreat have a significant effect on the results with respect to sea level rise [xxiv].   [i] J. E.

"assessment  Arctic and Baltic sea ice      The extent and volume of the Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly since global data became available, especially in summer. Over the period 19792015, the Arctic has lost, on average, 42 000 km 2  of sea ice per year in winter and 89 000 km 2  per year by the end of summer.   The nine lowest Arctic sea ice minima since records began in 1979 have been the September ice cover in each of the last nine years (20072015); the record low Arctic sea ice cover in September 2012 was roughly half the average minimum extent of 19812010. The annual maximum ice cover in March 2015 and March 2016 were the lowest on record, and the ice is also getting thinner.   The maximum sea ice extent in the Baltic Sea shows a decreasing trend since about 1800. The decrease appears to have accelerated since the 1980s, but the interannual variability is large.   Arctic sea ice is projected to continue to shrink and thin. For high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in September is likely before mid-century. There will still be substantial ice in winter.   Baltic Sea ice, in particular the extent of the maximal cover, is projected to continue to shrink.     cryosphere climate change arctic sea ice ocean baltic sea sea ice extent northern hemisphere arctic sea ice         CLIM CLIM010 010,Past trends In the period 19792015, the sea ice extent in the Arctic decreased by 42000km2 per year in winter (measured in March) and by 89000km2 per year in summer (measured in September) (Figure 1), which, based on historical records, is likely unprecedented since the 14th century [i]. The maximum sea ice extent in March 2015 and March 2016 were the lowest on record. Arctic sea ice loss is driven by a combination of warmer ocean waters and a warmer atmosphere, including an earlier onset of summer surface melt [ii]. In contrast, Antarctic sea ice has reached record high levels in recent years, but the expansion of the Antarctic sea ice has been less than half of the loss of Arctic sea ice [iii]. Changes in Arctic sea ice may trigger complex feedback processes. Warming and a longer melt season result in increased solar heat uptake by the ocean, which delays the autumn refreeze [iv]. However, a warmer atmosphere means that there are more clouds and, in summer, these reflect sunlight, thus representing a negative feedback mechanism. Even so, some evidence suggests that winter regrowth of ice is inhibited by the warmer ocean surface [v]. Thinner winter ice leads to more heat loss from the ocean and a warmer atmosphere, and hence thicker cloud cover, which inhibits the escape of heat to space [vi], which is a positive feedback mechanism. The minimum Arctic sea ice cover at the end of the melt season in September 2012 broke all previously observed records. All years since 2002 have been below the average for 19812010 (Figure 1). Comparison of recent sea ice coverage with older ship and aircraft observations suggests that summer sea ice coverage may have halved since the 1950s [vii]. Since more reliable satellite observations started in 1979, summer ice has shrunk by 10% per decade [viii]. Between 1979 and 2011, the reduction of sea ice has significantly reduced albedo, corresponding to an additional 6.40.9W/m2 of solar energy input into the Arctic Ocean region since 1979. Averaged over the globe, this albedo decrease corresponds to a forcing that is 25% of that due to the change in CO2 during this period [ix]. The Arctic sea ice is also getting thinner and younger, as less sea ice survives the summer to grow into thicker multi-year floes [x]. A recent analysis has found that annual mean ice thickness has decreased from 3.59m in 1975 to 1.25m in 2012, i.e. a 65% reduction in less than 40 years [xi]. This supports findings from calculations of sea ice volume from satellites and an earlier estimate by the Pan Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS)([1]), which suggests that the mean monthly sea ice volume has decreased by about 3000km3/decade since 1979 [xii]. Information on sea ice extent in the Baltic Sea goes back to 1720. The maximum sea ice extent has displayed a decreasing trend most of the time since about 1800 (Figure 2). The decrease in sea ice extent appears to have accelerated since the 1980s, but large interannual variability makes it difficult to demonstrate this statistically [xiii]. The frequency of mild ice winters, defined as having a maximum ice cover of less than 130000km2, has, however, increased from seven in 30 years in the period 19501979 to 15 in the period 19862015. The frequency of severe ice winters, defined as having a maximum ice cover of at least 270000km2, has decreased from six to four during the same periods. Projections Improving the ability to track the observed rapid summer-time melting of Arctic sea ice has been a challenge for modelling [xiv], but observations fall well within the model range in recent modelling studies [xv]. All model projections agree that Arctic sea ice will continue to shrink and thin. For high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in September is likely to occur before mid-century (Figure 3) [xvi]. An extension beyond 2100 suggests that, for the highest emissions scenario (RCP8.5), the Arctic could become ice-free year-round before the end of the 22nd century; on the other hand, a recovery of Arctic sea ice could become apparent in the 22nd century if stringent policies to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, and eventually concentrations, are successfully implemented [xvii]. Projections of Baltic Sea ice extent under different emissions scenarios suggest that the maximal ice cover and ice thickness will continue to shrink significantly over the 21st century. The best estimate of the decrease in maximum ice extent from a model ensemble is 6400km2/decade for a medium emissions scenario (RCP4.5) and 10900km2/decade for a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5); for the latter scenario, largely ice-free conditions are projected by the end of the century [xviii].

"assessment-6  Persistent organic pollutant emissions     The emissions of a number of compounds categorised as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) decreased between 1990 and 2014 in the EEA-33, e.g. hexachlorobenzene (HCB) by 95 %, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by 71 %, dioxins and furans by 85 % and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by 60 %.   Although the majority of countries report that POP emissions fell during this period, some report that emissions increased.    In 2014, the most significant sources of emissions for these POPs included the Commercial, institutional and households (13 % of HCB, 39 % of dioxins and furans, 54 % of PAHs and 15 % of PCBs) and Industrial processes and product use (16 % of HCB and 51 % of PCBs) sectors.      hcb furans air pollution polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pops pah dioxins air pollution indicators air emissions pcb hch persistent organic pollutants dioxins and furans pollution              APE APE006 006,Important emission sources of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) typically include residential combustion processes (open fires, coal and wood burning for heating purposes, etc.), industrial metal production processes and the road transport sector. Commercial, institutional and households: Current emissions from Commercial, institutional and households sources account for just over half of total PAH emissions and more than one third of the total dioxin and furan emissions for the EEA-33. Emissions from households have declined since 1990 as a result of a decrease in the residential use of coal. Industrial processes and product use: Industrial processes and product use sources account for half of the PCB emissions in the EEA-33, but emissions from this sector have decreased by around 80 % since 1990. Reductions in POP emissions in the 'Industrial processes and product use' sector have resulted from improvements in abatement technologies for metal refining and smelting. Road transport: Road transport emissions do not make particularly large contributions to total POP emissions in the EEA-33. ,   In the EEA-33 region, emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) decreased by 60 % between 1990 and 2014 (Figure 1). A combination of targeted legislation, details of which are set out in the 'Indicator specification  policy context' section, coupled with improved controls and abatement techniques, has led, in general, to significant progress being made in most countries to reduce PAH emissions (Figure 6).   Although the majority of individual countries report that PAH emissions have decreased since 1990, three countries (Denmark, Iceland and Malta) have reported an increase in PAH emissions. Of these countries, emissions in Iceland and Malta have increased by more than 50 % since 1990. One cause of these increased emissions is the introduction of policy measures that have encouraged the burning of renewable materials (e.g. wood by Danish households). Wood burning produces emissions of PAHs and hence, in this instance, policies that have been implemented to address one environmental issue (climate change) have had unintended consequences on another (air pollution). In absolute terms, the emissions of PAHs from these countries are relatively low compared with other countries, but the effect on local populations and environmental quality may, nevertheless, be notable. Of the EEA-33 countries, Germany and Spain report the highest PAH emissions; in these countries, emissions are nearly five times greater than the average reported estimate.   Emissions ofhexachlorobenzene (HCB) have fallen sharply in the EEA-33 since 1990, mostly because of a decrease of 5.6 tonnes in HCB emissions in the United Kingdom between 1998 and 1999, which accounts for 98 % of the decrease in EEA-33 emissions in 1999 (Figure 2). This large decrease was due to the introduction of regulations in the United Kingdom to control the use of hexachloroethane (HCE) tablets as a degassing agent in secondary aluminium production. A total of 61 % of the reduction in HCB emissions across all EEA-33 countries since 1990 can be explained by the fall in HCB emissions in the United Kingdom, from 59 % of EEA-33 emissions in 1990 to just 12 % in 2014.   Emissions of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the EEA-33 decreased by 89 % between 1990 and 2014, mainly because of reductions in 'Industrial processes and product use' emissions, which accounted for 69 % of the decrease over this period (Figure 6). Within the EEA-33 region, five countries have reported emissions of PCBs that are higher than emissions in 1990: Austria, Cyprus,Portugal, Spain and Sweden (Figure 4). In 2014, 23 countries reported lower emissions than in 1990, and the remaining five countries either did not report data or reported zero emissions for 1990.   The reported emissions of dioxins and furans in the EEA-33 countries decreased by 84 % between 1990 and 2014. Of the 31 countries which reported non-zero emissions, only Latvia and Malta reported an increase in emissions between 1990 and 2014 (Figure 5). The overall decrease in emissions across all EEA-33 countries was due to significantly reduced emissions from the 'Energy production and distribution' (28 % of overall decrease), 'Waste' (23 %) and 'Commercial, institutional and households' (22 %) sectors (Figure 6). In 2014, 39 % of dioxin and furan emissions were from sources in the 'Commercial, institutional and households' sector, 16 % were from the 'Energy use in industry' sector and 16 % were from the 'Waste' sector (Figure 6).  "
"assessment-3  Emissions of the main air pollutants in Europe     Anthropogenic emissions of the main air pollutants decreased significantly in most EEA member countries between 1990 and 2014:     emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x ) decreased by 51 % (55 % in the EU-28);   emissions of sulphur oxides (SO x ) decreased by 80 % (88 % in the EU-28);   emissions ofnon-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) decreased by 57 % (60 % in the EU-28);   emissions of ammonia (NH 3 ) decreased by 11 % (24 % in the EU-28);   emissions of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) decreased by 36 % (36 % in the EU-28).     The EU-28 met its continuing obligation to maintain emissions of NO x , SO x , NH 3  and NMVOCs below legally binding targets, as specified by the National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD). A number of EU Member States reported emissions that were above their NECD emission ceilings: three countries(Austria, Ireland and Luxembourg) exceeded emission ceilingsfor NO x , five (Austria, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain)exceeded emission ceilingsfor NH 3 and two (Ireland and Luxembourg)exceeded emission ceilingsfor NMVOCs.There are no emission ceilings for primary PM 2.5 .   Three additional EEA member countries (Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland)had emission ceilings for 2010 that were set in the Gothenburg Protocol under the 1979 United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution. Liechtenstein and Norway reported emissions above their NH 3  ceilings.   Emission reduction commitments for 2020 have been set under the revised Gothenburg Protocol for NO x , SO x , NMVOC, NH 3 and PM 2.5 . The EU-28 as a whole is on track to meet its reduction commitments.     europe trends emissions by sector group main air pollutant emissions    CSI CSI040 APE APE010 040 010,The National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD) and the Gothenburg Protocol under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) set emission ceilings for European countries for sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and ammonia (NH3). The NECD emission ceilings had to be met by 2010 and for the years thereafter. The 2012 amended Gothenburg Protocol sets 2010 and 2020 emission ceilings for these same four pollutants, and it also includes ceilings for primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions for 2020(see Indicator Specification for details). The aim of the NECD and the Gothenburg Protocol is to restrict the emissions of selected air pollutants, including ozone and particulate matter (PM) precursors and pollutants that contribute to ecosystem acidification and eutrophication. Information on the exceedance of air quality standards for the protection of human health, and the exposure of ecosystems to acidification, eutrophication and ozone is available from EEA indicators CSI004 and CSI005, respectively. In 2013, 24 countries reported emissions above their 2020 NOxNECD reduction commitments, 19 reported emissions above their NH3 ceilings, 20 reported emissions above their NMVOCs ceilings, 13reported emissions above their SO2 ceilings and 23 reported emissionsabove their PM2.5 ceilings.  Sulphur oxides In 2014, SOx emissions were approximately 13 % of 1990 levels for the EU-28. Emissions continue to fall, and for the EEA-33 they are just below 20 % of 1990 emission levels. All countries continue to meet their 2010 emission ceiling commitments. Nitrogen oxides NOxemissions for the EEA-33 and the EU-28 continue to fall, and are about half of their 1990 values. These reductions have primarily been due to the introduction of three-way catalytic converters for cars. However, the observed emission reductions from some modern vehicles have not met initial expectations, and actual emissions from vehicles (often termed real-world driving emissions) may exceed the emissions reported during the test-cycle specified by the European emission standards for each vehicle type. Non-methane volatile organic compounds NMVOC emissions for the EEA-33 and the EU-28 have fallen to less than half of their 1990 levels, and nearly all countries have reported emissions below their 2010 emission ceilings. Ammonia NH3 emissions have fallen less than those of the other NECD pollutants. They decreased by approximately 25 % for the EU-28 and 11 % for the EEA-33 (a slight increase from 2013 to 2014)compared with 1990 levels. The majority of countries have reported meeting their 2010 NECDemission ceiling commitments. The NECD does not include a stricter ceiling for environmental objectives, as is the case for the other main air pollutants. Fine particulate matter Emissions of primary PM2.5 have decreased to about a third, for both the EEA-33 and the EU-28, of their 1990 levels. The timeline of emissions reductions shows that the EU-28 as a whole is on track towards achieving the total reduction target set by the Gothenburg Protocol. The country-specific PM2.5 timelines suggest that some countries (approximately one third) are not on track to meet their individual commitments by 2020. These countries may therefore need to implement emission reduction measures beyond those currently in place.,European legal instruments directly and indirectly addressthe mitigation of air pollutant emissions from specific source sectors (for details see Indicator Specification). The newer Member States of the European Union have, in a number of cases, undergone major economic structural changes since the early 1990s, which has led to significant reductions. In many cases, these changes have led to a general decline in some activities that previously contributed significantly to the total emissions of air pollutants (e.g. heavy industry), such as the closure of older, less efficient power plants, etc. Over recent years, there has also been a modernisation of the road vehicle fleet, including the introduction of more vehicles with improved emissions control. Sulphur oxides Emissions of SOx are dominated by emissions from the 'Energy production and distribution' sector, which typically accounts for 60 % of total emissions from the EEA-33. This source is also responsible for the largest reduction in emissions since 1990. Stationary combustion: Substantial SOx emissions reductions have been made across a number of sectors. The three largest sectors ('Energy production and distribution', 'Energy use in industry' and 'Commercial, institutional and households') have all reduced their emissions by more than 75 % since 1990. However, despite these large reductions, the 'Energy production and distribution' sector (encompassing activities such as power and heat generation) still remains the most significant source of SOx in the EEA-33 region, contributing over half of the current total of SOx emissions. Shipping: Across Europe, there has also been an increase in the awareness of the contribution madeby national and international shipping traffic to SOx emissions, particularlythe contribution made to air pollution in nearby urban areas by ships at berth (a more detailed discussion of this issue is contained in the 'Transport and environment reporting mechanism' (TERM) indicator fact sheet TERM03  Transport emissions of air pollutants). Acombination of measures has led to reductions in SOx emissions:  Fuel switching: There have been substantial changes from high-sulphur solid (e.g. coal) and liquid (e.g. heavy fuel oil) fuels to low-sulphur fuels (such as natural gas) for power and heat production purposes within the energy, industry and domestic sectors. Abatement equipment: Where high-sulphur fuels are used, flue gas desulphurisation equipment is now installed in new industrial facilities, and has also been retro-fitted to existing facilities. Improvements in energy efficiency: Improvements in energy efficiency have brought about decreases in the demand for energy, which has reduced associated emissions. Sulphur content of fuel: The implementation of several directives within the EU limiting the sulphur content of transport fuel has also contributed to the decrease.   Nitrogen oxides Emissions from 'Road transport' and 'Non-road transport' combine to account for around half of the current NOx emissionsin the EEA-33. Road transport: Since 1990, there have been considerable reductions in NOx and other ozone precursor pollutants in the road transport sector, despite the general increase in transport activity within this sector over the period. This sector alone has contributed to over 40 % of the totalreduction in NOx emissions. These emissions reductions have primarily been achieved as a result of fitting three-way catalytic converters to petrol-fuelled cars (driven by the legislative European emissions standards).Disparities between trends in NOx emissions and ambient NO2 concentrations (see CSI004) are due in part to the increase in the use of diesel vehicles, and the fact that the real-world emissions performances of modern diesel vehicles have not improved to the extent initially suggested by the test-cycle emissions factors used in emission inventories  however, improvements have been made to many emission inventories for the EU-28 countries in an attempt to address this. The disparities are also due to the increase in the proportion of NOx emitted directly as NO2 (primary NO2) from the exhausts of modern diesel vehicles, as a result of emission control systems that aim to reduce total NOx and particulate matter emissions. Energy production and energy use in industry: Emissions of NOx have also declined in the 'Energy production and distribution' sector, and current emissions are approximately half of those in 1990. Furthermore, there have been substantial reductions in emissions from the Energy use in industry sector. These reductions have been achieved through the implementation of measures such as combustion modification (for example the use of low NOx burners), the introduction of flue-gas abatement techniques and fuel-switching from coal to gas. One of the most common forms of combustion modification is the use of low-NOx burners, which can typically reduce emissions by up to 40 %. Flue gas treatment techniques (such as NOx scrubbers, or selective catalytic reduction (SCR) or selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) techniques) can also be used to remove NOx from flue gases. Emissions of NOx are higher from coal-fired power plants than from gas-fired plants, as coal (unlike gas)contains significant amounts of nitrogen. Shipping: There has been an increase in the focus on the relative contribution made to NOx pollutant emissions by national and international shipping traffic (a more detailed discussion of this issue is available in the TERM indicator fact sheet TERM03  Transport emissions of air pollutants).  Non-methane volatile organic compounds Solvent and product use: The largest source of current NMVOC emissions is the 'Solvent and product use' sector (approximately 50 % of the EEA-33 emissions total). Emissions have been reduced to less than two thirds of 1990 emission levels. Important EU regulatory measures  the Solvent Emissions Directive (1999) and the Paints Directive (2004)  were introduced and have led to reductions in the solvent content of products and emissions from industries using solvents. Road transport and non-road transport: Emissions from the 'Road transport' and 'Non-road transport' sectors combine to contribute approximately 15 % of the total NMVOC emissions. Emissions from the Commercial, institutional and households sector make a similar contribution to the total. Since 1990, a considerable reduction in ozone precursor pollutant emissions (NMVOCs and NOx) has occurred in the road transport sector, despite the general increase in transport activity within this sector over the period. Road transport alone accounts for half of the total NMVOC reductions since 1990. These emissions reductions have primarily been achieved as a result of fitting three-way catalytic converters to petrol-fuelled cars (driven by the legislative European emissions standards).  Ammonia Agriculture: Agriculture dominates emissions of NH3, amounting to 94 % of total emissions in the EEA-33 region. Emissions ariseprimarily from the decomposition of urea in animal wastes and uric acid in poultry wastes. Emissions depend on the animal species, age, weight, diet, housing system, waste management and liquid manure storage techniques. Emissions of NH3 have reduced by approximately 10 % since 1990, as a result of changes in the agriculture sector. These changes include a reduction in livestock numbers (especially cattle), and changes in the handling and management of both organic manure and synthetic fertilisers.  Fine particulate matter Commercial, institutional and households: Emissions from the Commercial, institutional and households sector account for over half of the current primary PM2.5 emissions for the EEA-33 region. Within this sector, emissions are almost exclusively from households (over 95 %). Current emissions are 9 % lower than those in 1990. However, since 2007, emissions have fluctuated  this has been strongly influenced by PM2.5 emissionsfrom wood combustion in the residential sector. Energy production and energy use in industry: These sources account for a combined contribution to current EEA-33 emissions of only approximately 12 %, but they account for nearly half of the emissions reductions since 1990. This reflects several changes in the electricity generating and heavy industrial sectors. Fuel switching away from coal has reduced emissions of PM2.5, and the introduction of abatement equipment, such as electrostatic precipitators, has also significantly reduced the emissions of PM2.5. Road transport: Emissions from road transport account for approximately 13 % of the PM2.5emissions total in the EEA-33 region, but account for one quarter of the reduction in total EEA-33 emissions since 1990. This reflects the improved emissions control technologies that have been introduced, particularly for diesel vehicles.  [i]Emissions from Turkey were not reported."
"assessment-6  Heavy metal emissions     Across the EEA-33 countries, emissions of lead decreased by 92 %, mercury by 73 % and cadmium by 66 % between 1990 and 2014.   Across the EEA-33 countries, emissions of lead from the road transport sector decreased by 98 % between 1990 and 2014. Nevertheless, the road transport sector still remains an important source of lead, contributing around 15 % of total lead emissions in the EEA-33 region. The largest sources are industrial processes and product use, which together account for 23 % of emissions. However, since 2004, little progress has been made in reducing emissions further; 99 % of the total reduction in emissions of lead from 1990 levels had been achieved by 2004.     mercury lead heavy metals cadmium air pollution indicators air emissions pollution       APE APE005 005,The largest current emission sources for the heavy metals cadmium, mercury and lead are energy-related sources associated with fuel combustion. The major contributors are public power and heat-generating facilities, and fuel combustion for energy use in industrial facilities. The emissions from the Commercial, Institutional and Households sector are also a large source of Cd, accounting for 20 % of current EEA-33 emissions. Lead from Road Transport: As noted earlier, the promotion of unleaded petrol within the EU and in other EEA member countries, through a combination of fiscal and regulatory measures, has been a key success story within Europe. Large reductions in Pb emissions from the road transport sector (over 98 %) has been responsible for the vast majority of the overall reduction in Pb emissions since 1990. Nevertheless, the road transport sector still remains an important source of Pb, contributing approximately 15 % of total Pb emissions in the EEA-33. Residual Pb in fuel, from engine lubricants and parts, and from tyre and brake wear, contribute to continued Pb emissions from this sector. Industrial Processes: Emissions of Pb and Cd from some industrial processes, such as metal refining and smelting activities, have also both decreased. This reflects improved pollution abatement control and, in some countries, is a result of economic restructuring and the closure of older and more polluting industrial facilities. Mercury from Energy Production: Since 1990, the largest reduction (in absolute terms) in Hg emissions has been achieved by the 'Energy production and distribution' sector, i.e. public power and heat generation. Emissions of Hg from this sector are closely linked to the use of coal, which contains Hg as a contaminant. Changes in fuel use within the'Energy production and distribution' sector since 1990 are mainly responsible for past decreases in emissions from this sector, particularly fuel switching from coal to gas and other energy sources in many countries, the closure of older, inefficient coal-burning plants, and improved pollution abatement equipment etc.  ,There are only a few areas in Europe[1] where ambient air concentrations of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), arsenic (As) and nickel (Ni) are above the limit or target values. Exceedances of the limit or target values and human exposure at these locations is very much a local problem, typically caused by specific industrial plants. However, the atmospheric deposition of toxic metals contributes to the exposure of ecosystems and organisms to toxic metals. Bioaccumulation can subsequently occur in the food chain, thus affecting human health. Within the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, emissions of heavy metals are controlled by the Amended Protocol on Heavy Metals [2], which requires parties to reduce emissions of selected metals to below 1990 levels. Releases of Hg are also controlled by the United Nations Environment Programme Minimata Convention [3]. In the EEA-33 region, emissions of Cd and Hg make up approximately a third and a quarter of the corresponding total emissions in 1990, respectively. Emissions of Pb have declined to approximately one tenth of the total emissions in 1990.  A combination of targeted legislation (for details see Policy context in the Indicator specification), improved controls and abatement techniques have, in general, led to significant progress being made in most countries to reduce heavy metal emissions.  Cadmium (Cd) EEA-33 emissions of Cd have declined by approximately one third since 1990. This is largely due to improvements in abatement technologies for wastewater treatment and incinerators, and in metal refining and smelting facilities. EC Directives and Regulations that mandate reductions, and limits on heavy metal emissions (e.g. the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) [4] and associated permitting conditions) have also contributed to reducing Cd emissions. Around one half of EEA-33 countries (that reported the relevant data) have achieved emission reductions for Cd in excess of 66 % since 1990. In recent years, by far the largest emitter of Cd is Poland  accounting for 20 % of total EEA-33 emissions.  Mercury (Hg) EEA-33 emissions of Hg have declined by approximately one quarter since 1990. This is attributed chiefly to changes in the industrial sector, such as improvements in emission controls on Hg cells and their replacement by diaphragm or membrane cells, and fuel switching from coal to gas and other energy sources in the power and heat generating sectors in many countries. In addition, emissions have been reduced by the effect of various EU Directives and Regulations that mandate reductions in heavy metal emissions. All of the EEA-33 (with the exception of Lichtenstein and Cyprus) have reported a decrease in emissions of Hg from 1990 levels. A third of the countries show emissions reductions of more than 80 %. Since 1990, the largest reduction in Hg emissions has been achieved by the 'Energy production and distribution' sector i.e. public power and heat generation. Emissions of Hg from this sector are closely linked to the use of coal, which contains Hg as a contaminant. Changes in fuel use within this sector since 1990 are mainly responsible for past decreases in emissions from this sector, particularly fuel switching from coal to gas and other energy sources in many countries, the closure of older, inefficient coal-burning plants and improved pollution abatement equipment etc.  Lead (Pb) EEA-33 emissions of Pb have declined to less than one tenth of total emissions in 1990. This is primarily due to reductions in emissions from the road transport sector made by countries. The promotion of unleaded petrol within the EU, through a combination of fiscal and regulatory measures, has been a particular success story. EU Member States and other EEA member countries have now phased out the use of leaded petrol, a goal that was regulated in the EU by the Directive on the Quality of Petrol and Diesel Fuels (98/70/EC). The largest emitter of Pb is currently Poland (20% of total EEA-33 emissions). The only country to report current Pb emission levels that are higher than those in 1990 is Malta. This is primarily caused by changes in the energy production and distribution sector, which give rise to very large increases when expressed on a relative basis.

"assessment  Energy intensity    Between 1990 and 2014, energy intensity (the ratio of gross inland energy consumption and gross domestic product (GDP)) decreased by 1.7 % per year in both the EU-28 and the group of EEA countries. In 2014, energy intensity was 35 % below 1990 levels in the EU-28 and in the group of EEA countries .    During this period, the rate of decrease of energy intensity in the EU-28 has been rather constant. The 1990-2005   period   is characterised by relatively high economic growth and the more moderate growth of gross inland energy consumption. The 2005-2014   period, however,   is characterised by lower economic growth and decreasing gross inland energy consumption. As a result, the rate of decrease of energy intensity is rather similar in both periods .     In all EEA member countries [1]   energy intensity   decreased between 2005 and 2014, except for Estonia, Iceland and Turkey. The largest decreases were observed in central and eastern European countries (e.g. Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia) because of changes in their economic structure .    [1] The 33 EEA member countries include the 28 European Union Member States together with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey.     gdp energy soer2015 intensity soer2015 european     CSI CSI028 ENER ENER017 028 017,Energy intensity in the EU-28  Between 1990 and 2005, a relative decoupling of economic growth from gross inland energy consumption occurred in the EU-28, as energy consumption grew more slowly than GDP. Since the 2005/2006 peak in EU-28 gross inland energy consumption, an absolute decoupling of economic growth from gross inland energy consumption has taken place. In 2014, gross inland energy consumption in the EU-28 was 12.3 % lower than in 2005, while the economy grew by 7.5 % during this period. In 2014, gross inland energy consumption in the EU-28 was 3.7 % below 1990 levels, an average decrease of 0.2 % per year (see ENER 026), while GDP, measured in 2010 constant prices, grew by 1.6 % per year. As a consequence, energy intensity in the EU-28 fell by 1.7 % per year during this period (see Figure 1). Between 2005 and 2014, gross inland energy consumption in EU-28 decreased by 1.4 % per year, while GDP increased by 0.8 % per year. As a consequence, energy intensity in the EU-28 decreased by an average of 2.2 % per year during this period. In 2014, energy intensity in the EU-28 was 34 % below 1990 levels. Since 2005, energy efficiency improvement has accelerated. Average per capita gross inland energy consumption in the EU-28 was 3.2 tonnes of oil equivalent (TOE) in 2014. In the EU-28, the observed reduction of energy intensity was influenced by improvements in energy efficiency both for final users and for power generation as well as by the increase of renewable energy in the power mix and by structural changes within the economy. The latter included an increase in the contribution of services to GDP and a shift within the industrial sectors from energy intensive industries to less energy intensive industries that have a higher value added.   Energy intensity in EEA member countries  Between 1990 and 2014, all countries except Iceland, showed an absolute or relative decoupling of GDP growth from gross inland energy consumption development. Countries in which GDP grew while gross inland energy consumption fell (absolute decoupling) are: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and the United Kingdom. Countries in which GDP grew and gross inland consumption grew too, but at a lower pace (relative decoupling) are: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Turkey. In Iceland, the growth of gross inland energy consumption exceeded economic growth between 1990 and 2014 (and in particular after 2005). In Turkey, growth in GDP and gross inland energy consumption have been closely linked between 1990 and 2014, but with GDP growing slightly more strongly, a slight relative decoupling has resultsed. For Switzerland, data on gross inland energy consumption were not available. Except for Estonia (+0.3 % per year), Iceland (4.9 % per year) and Turkey (+0.4 % per year), all EEA member countries show a decrease in energy intensity between 2005 and 2014. The largest decreases since 1990 were observed in central and eastern European countries (e.g. Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia) because of the changes in their economic structure resulting from the closure of energy inefficient industries in the early 1990s followed by economic growth in less energy intensive sectors during the 2000s. In 2014, significant differences in energy intensity [1] were observed between the EU-28 Member States. The highest energy intensity was observed in Estonia, Finland, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic. The lowest energy intensity was observed in Ireland, Denmark, Malta and Italy. In 2014, the lowest values for gross inland energy consumption per capita were observed in Turkey, Romania and Croatia (less than 2 TOE per capita), while the highest values (more than 6 TOE per capita) were observed in Iceland, Luxembourg and Finland.  [1]To enable the comparison, energy intensity was measured, in this case, in purchasing power standards relative to the EU-28 average."
"co2-emissions-from-cars-and  CO2 emissions from cars and vans: all larger manufacturers met their 2015 targets  Based on current testing rules in force, virtually all car and van manufacturers have met their specific CO2 emissions target in 2015, according to a new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA). The report confirms preliminary findings published earlier this year showing that the EU as a whole is well below its average emissions target for the same year.    The new EEA report, ' Monitoring CO 2  emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2015 ', provides a summary of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission levels of new passenger cars and vans in the European Union (EU) in 2015 based on laboratory tests following a standard European vehicle test protocol used for vehicle type-approval.   The new findings largely confirm preliminary data published for  cars  and  vans  earlier this year. They show that new cars sold in the EU in 2015 had CO 2  average emissions of 119.5 g CO 2 /km, which was 8.0 % below the 2015 target of 130 g CO 2 /km, and 27 % lower than in 2004.  Similarly, the average emissions from vans sold in 2015 were 168.3 g CO 2 /km, below the 2017 target of 175 g CO 2 /km. This represents a reduction of 6.5 % since monitoring commenced in 2012. In order to meet their respective future targets, i.e. 147 g CO 2 /km for vans by 2020 and 95 g CO 2 /km for cars by 2021, the average CO 2  emissions need to continue decreasing at a similar pace.   The report also presents data on manufacturer’s individual performances. The majority of car and van makers met their CO 2  specific emissions target in 2015. Two manufacturers, Aston Martin Lagonda and Ferrari, exceeded their specific emissions target by a small amount and therefore excess emission premiums will be imposed.   Other key findings     As in previous years, conventional diesel and petrol cars accounted for the large majority of new sales in 2015 (97.2 %). Diesel vehicles remained the most sold vehicles in Europe, constituting 52 % of sales, slightly lower than in 2014 when 53 % of all new cars were fuelled by diesel. The proportion of plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles increased from 0.8 % in 2014 to more than 1 % in 2015. For vans, the vast majority of vehicles are fuelled with diesel (97 %).   Diesel cars, which on average are 300 kg heavier than petrol cars, emitted on average 119.2 g CO 2 /km. This is 3.3 g CO 2 /km less than the average for petrol cars. The emission difference between diesel and petrol cars has been narrowing in the last decade. In 2000 the difference was 17.1 g CO 2 /km.   Amongst the largest car manufacturers, Automobiles Peugeot, Automobiles Citroen, Renault and Toyota Motor Europe continue to produce most of the lowest-emitting cars. Improving their performance by more than 5 g CO 2 /km, Automobiles Peugeot (104 g CO 2 /km) and Automobiles Citroen (106 g CO 2 /km) had the lowest average CO 2  emissions for new passenger cars registered in 2015.   Toyota Motor Europe had the highest percentage of new vehicles having emissions below 95 g CO 2 /km (41 %).   The largest reductions in average emission levels in the last year were achieved by Jaguar Land Rover Limited (14.4 g CO 2 /km) and Daimler AG (6.9 g CO 2 /km).   For the third year in a row, Automobile Dacia SA achieved the lowest average CO 2  emissions from vans (133 g CO 2 /km).

The EEA report documents the latest official data submitted by Member States and vehicle manufacturers. However, it is not possible to assess the extent to which incorrect data from vehicle manufacturers may alter the analysis and conclusions. The final CO 2  performance for each manufacturer and pool is confirmed by Commission Decision.     Laboratory versus real world driving emissions    Member States report new vehicles’ CO 2  emission levels, measured under  standardised laboratory conditions, following the requirements of the  New European Driving Cycle  (NEDC) test procedur e. This cycle allows a comparison of emissions by manufacturers, but it does not necessarily represent real-world driving conditions. There is now wide recognition of the increasing divergence between real world CO 2  emissions and those measured according to the NEDC test procedure.  In order to address this increasing gap, the European Commission has proposed in June 2016 the implementation of a more robust test procedure, the World Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). This new test procedure will ensure more strict and representative test conditions. It is foreseen that the new WLTP test will be mandatory for all new vehicle types from September 2017 and for all new vehicles from September 2018.    Additional information   The  European Commission press release :  CO 2  emissions from new cars and vans continue to fall    emissions from transport road transport van emissions eu emission standards for road vehicles car emissions,The new EEA report, 'Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2015', provides a summary of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission levels of new passenger cars and vans in the European Union (EU) in 2015 based on laboratory tests following a standard European vehicle test protocol used for vehicle type-approval.

"european-hazardous-waste-management-improving  European hazardous waste management improving, but its prevention needs attention  Despite improvements in hazardous waste management, more measures would be required to prevent the build-up of hazardous waste across Europe, according to a European Environment Agency (EEA) report released today. The report reviews the application of waste prevention programmes across European countries regarding waste types that are considered to be most dangerous to human health and the environment.    The EEA report ‘ Prevention of hazardous waste in Europe – the status in 2015 ,’  is the third annual review of waste prevention programmes done by the EEA. This year’s review focuses on the prevention of hazardous waste that is one of the priorities of environmental policies in Europe. The assessment looks at current trends in the amounts of hazardous waste generated both in Europe and in individual countries, based on the latest data available. It provides an overview of waste prevention objectives, targets, indicators, and measures.   At a reported 100 million tonnes, hazardous waste accounted for close to 4% of the 2.5 billion tonnes of waste generated across the European Union in 2012. The predominant types of hazardous waste were mineral and solidified wastes, chemical and medical wastes, with the waste management, construction, mining and quarrying, and household sectors as the top sources. Total hazardous waste generation has increased slightly since 2008, according to the report.   More than half of the reviewed waste prevention programmes include measures to reduce the generation of hazardous waste. Most of the measures are linked to curbing production and including bans on toxic materials. However, prevention of hazardous waste appears to have lower priority than management aspects, and limited financial support. Prioritisation at the EU level is one of the drivers for better prevention at national or regional levels, the report says.   The report also raises data quality issues, and highlights that changes in waste classification and definition of hazardous waste cause reporting and interpretation problems and may affect the accuracy and comparability of national data. This is also likely to affect national target setting and indicator development.     More information about waste prevention programmes is available in  individual country/region fact sheets.     waste generation waste prevention electronic waste eu waste types hazardous waste waste management targets,The EEA report ‘Prevention of hazardous waste in Europe – the status in 2015,’  is the third annual review of waste prevention programmes done by the EEA.

"assessment-1  Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption   The consumption of renewable energy continued to increase in 2014. The amount of renewable energy as a share of gross final energy consumption in the EU-28 countries reached 16.0 % in 2014, representing 80 % of the EU's 20 % renewable energy target for 2020. Renewable energy contributed 17.7 % of gross final energy consumption for heating and cooling, 27.5 % of final electricity consumption and 5.9 % of transport fuels consumption in 2014.   In 2014, 27 Member States (i.e. all except the Netherlands) met or exceeded their indicative targets set under the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), while 22 Member States (i.e. all except France, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal) reached or exceeded the indicative trajectories set in their National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAPs).   In 2014, nine countries ( Bulgaria,    Croatia,  the Czech Republic,    Estonia,  Finland,  Italy,  Lithuania,  Romania and  Sweden  ) managed to reach their binding renewable energy share targets for 2020 set under the RED  .   CSI CSI048 ENER ENER028 048 028,In 2014, energy from renewable sources accounted for 16.0 % of gross final energy consumption [1]in the EU-28, representing some 80 % of the EUs 20 % renewable energy target for 2020 (see Figure 1). The consumption of renewable energy increased annually by 5.7 % between 2005 and 2014 (including by 5.8 % from 2010 to 2014). It is worth noting that gross final energy consumption decreased, on average, by 1.2 % per year between 2005 and 2014, (including by 2.2 % per year from 2010 to 2014). Between 2005 and 2014, the largest increases in the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption were observed in Denmark (+13.2 percentage points), Sweden (+12.0 percentage points), Finland (+9.9 percentage points), Italy (+9.5 percentage points) and Austria (+9.3 percentage points). In 2014, the share of renewable energy in transport (RES-T) [2]reached 5.9 % in the EU-28. It was 1.4 % in 2005, 4.8 % in 2010 and 5.4 % in 2013. In accordance with the sustainability requirements of the Renewable Energy Directive, biofuels consumed in transport may only be counted towards renewable energy targets if Member States have shown compliance with Article 17 of that Directive. However, not all countries have been able to show compliance for all biofuels from 2011 onwards, in which case these biofuels have not been included in the figures for those years. The share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption [3]across non-EU EEA countries amounted to 77.1 % in Iceland (linked to the high shares of geothermal energy and hydropower in2014), 69.2 % in Norway (linked to the high share of hydropower in 2014),12 % in Turkey (2011 data) and 22 % in Switzerland (2010 data). In 2014, all countries in Europe had policies and support schemes for renewables in place. In accordance with the reporting requirements set out in the Renewable Energy Directive, every two years the European Commission publishes a Renewable Energy Progress Report based on national progress reports submitted by countries. The Commissions progress report of 2015 assesses Member States' progress in the promotion and use of renewable energy towards their intermediate trajectories and 2020 renewable energy targets. Various forms of support scheme are used within Member States, such as feed-in tariffs, feed-in premiums, auction/tender systems or quota obligations [4]. The Renewable Energy Directive provides three types of cooperation mechanism that allow Member States to achieve their national 2020 renewable energy targets. Until now, these cooperation mechanisms have hardly been used, with Sweden and Norway the only two countries to have reported a joint undertaking in 2014. To contribute towards a more harmonised approach in supporting renewables across the EU, in 2014 the European Commission published Guidelines on state aid for environmental protection and energyfor the period until 2020.   [1]In the Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC), gross final energy consumption is defined as energy commodities delivered for energy purposes to final consumers (industry, transport, households, services, agriculture, forestry and fisheries), including the consumption of electricity and heat by the energy branch for electricity and heat production, and including losses of electricity and heat in distribution and transmission.  [2]The share of renewable energy in transport is defined in Article 3 of the Renewable Energy Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. [3]Normalised consumption for these countries was calculated according to the requirement of the Renewable Energy Directive. [4]More information is available on the European Commission website in the RES Progress reportsand the RES-Legal database, and in the database of the World Energy Council on policies and measures. ,In 2014, renewable electricity[1]accounted for 43 % of gross final renewable energy consumption in the EU-28, while renewable energy for heating and cooling accounted for 50 %, and renewable energy in transport for 7 % (see also Figure 3). In 2014, renewable electricity accounted for 27.5 % of gross final electricity consumption in the EU-28, compared with 14.9 % in 2005 and 19.7 % in 2010.  Hydropower was the greatest contributor to renewable electricity in the EU-28, representing 40 % of total renewable electricity production. However, the relative importance of hydropower decreased substantially after 2005, when it still generated 70 % of renewable electricity, because wind and solar energy were developing rapidly over this period. Wind accounted for 29 % of renewable electricity in 2014, compared with 14 % in 2005. Solar energy accounted for 11 % of renewable electricity in 2014, compared with 0.3 % in 2005. Solid biofuels accounted for 12 % of renewable electricity in 2014, compared with 11 % in 2005. All other renewables accounted for 9 % of renewable electricity in 2014, compared with 4 % in 2005. There was a large variation in renewable electricity between countries in Europe: from 3.3 % in Malta and 5.9 % in Luxembourg, to 70.0 % and 63.3 % in Austria and Sweden, respectively. This reflects, among other things, different starting points in the deployment of renewables in each country, differences in the physical capacity to produce renewable energy and, to a lesser extent, differences in policies to stimulate renewables.  In 2014, renewable energy for heating and cooling accounted for 17.7 % of total final energy consumption for heating and cooling in the EU-28, compared with 10.8 % in 2005 and 14.8 % in 2010.  Final energy consumption of renewables represented 77 % of total renewable energy for heating and cooling. Renewable heat production from large biomass combined heating and power (CHP) and heat plants connected to heat-distribution networks (derived heat) accounted for 14 % of total renewable energy for heating and cooling. Renewable heating and cooling from heat pumps represented 9 % of total renewable energy for heating and cooling.    In 2014, renewable energy accounted for 5.9 % of energy in the transport sector for the EU-28, compared with 1.4 % in 2005. Between 2005 and 2014, there was an annual average increase of 18.0 % in biofuel consumption in the transport sector (if all biofuels in transport are included). The total consumption of biofuels in transport reached 14.1 Mtoe in 2014, of which 12.9 Mtoe was shown to be compliant with sustainability criteria. The 5.9 % share of renewable energy consumption in transport in the European Union in 2014 is higher than the 2003 biofuel directive target of 5.75 % in 2010[2].   In 2014, only Finland and Sweden exceeded the target of a 10 % share of renewables in final transport energy consumption by 2020. In the same year, Austria,the Czech Republic,France, Germany, Hungary and Slovakia had a share of renewables in final transport energy consumption of between 6 % and 10 %. In absolute terms however, France and Germany were by far the largest consumers of biofuels in transport, amounting each to roughly one fifth of the EU-28 market in 2014. In 2014, 27 Member States (i.e. all except the Netherlands) met or exceeded their indicative targets set under the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), while 22 Member States (i.e. all except France, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal) reached or exceeded the indicative trajectories set in their National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAPs). In 2014, nine countries (Bulgaria, Croatia,the Czech Republic, Estonia,Finland,Italy,Lithuania, Romaniaand Sweden) managed to reach their binding renewable energy share targets for 2020 set under the RED.   [1] With normalised hydropower and electricity from wind.  [2] The 5.75 % target for biofuels in transport, introduced by Directive 2003/30/EC on the promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport, was in force until January 2012. Those countries that underperformed in 2010 still had another year to meet the Directive's demands. Following that deadline, the target was replaced by the specific target in the Renewable Energy Directive of a 10 % share of renewables in final transport energy consumption by 2020. "
"assessment  Overview of electricity production and use in Europe   In 2014, low-carbon energy sources (renewables and nuclear energy) continued to dominate the electricity mix for the second year in a row,   together   generating more power than fossil fuel sources.      In 2014, fossil fuels were responsible for 42 % of all gross electricity generation, a decrease of 25 % compared with 1990 across  the EU-28  .    By way of contrast, the share of electricity generated from renewable sources is growing rapidly and reached more than one quarter of all gross electricity generation in the EU-28 (29 %  in 2014  ), more than twice as much as in 1990. As such, renewable sources generated more electricity in 2014 than nuclear sources or coal and lignite.    Nuclear energy sources contributed roughly one quarter of all gross electricity generation in 2014 (27.5 %).         Final electricity consumption (the total consumption of electricity by all end-use sectors plus electricity imports and minus exports) has increased by 25 % in the EU-28 since 1990, at an average rate of around 0.9 % per year (see ENER 016). In the EU-28, the strongest growth was observed in the services sector (2.5 % per year), followed by households (1.1 % per year).       With regard to the non-EU EEA countries, between 1990 and 2014 electricity generation increased by an average of 6.5 % per year in Turkey, 6.3 % per year in Iceland and 0.5 % per year in Norway.    energy consumption electric sector electricity energy electricity consumption ghg retrospective      ENER ENER038 038,Power generation is becoming more efficient in the EU-28, with the average efficiency having increased from 36 % in 1990 to 44 % in 2014. Efficiency depends mainly on the mix of fuels (fossil, nuclear or renewables) and the mix of power and heat generation:  high efficiencies are related to hydro and wind (100 % efficiency, given that electricity is the first measurable primary equivalent energy for these renewable energy technologies); low efficiencies are associated with old fossil fuel fired power and/or heat plants (<30 %), nuclear power plants (typically 33 %, with heat being the first measurable primary equivalent energy), direct biomass burning (20-25 %) or geothermal power and/or heat generation (around 10 % or less, with heat being the first measurable primary equivalent energy). The co-firing of fossil fuel plants with biomass does not decrease the efficiency of these plants significantly. between 1990 and 2014, the share of electricity in the output of conventional thermal plants and district heating (electricity and heat) increased slightly in combination with increasing efficiencies(seeENER 019).   The EEA member countries with an average power generation efficiency of 50 % or more in 2014 were: Norway (99 %), Austria (75 %), Luxembourg (74 %), Croatia (65 %), Portugal (58 %), Ireland (55 %) and Spain (51 %). The largest increases occurred in Romania and Croatia due to the decommissioning of inefficient fossil fuel-fired power plants and the increased share of hydro and/or wind: Romania increased from 23 % in 1990 to 46 % in 2014, while Croatia increased from 46 % to 65 % in the same period.,Electricity consumption Between 1990 and 2014, final electricity consumption (i.e. the total consumption by all end-use sectors plus electricity imports and minus exports) increased in the EU-28 by 25.1 %, at an average annual growth rate of 0.9 % per year(seeFigure 3). Power stations' own electricity consumption (for instance in transformers, per unit of electricity produced) and the associated transmission and distribution network losses led to a slightly lower growth rate for electricity consumption than for electricity generation.  Most countries in the EU-28 experienced an overall increase in electricity consumption over this period, except for Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria and Latvia. However, the average annual growth rate of electricity consumption varied greatly by country, ranging from -1.1 % per year in Lithuania and Romania to about 3.4 % per year in Cyprus and Malta. The decrease or low growth in electricity consumption in the new Member States was a combined result of economic restructuring in the 1990s, price adjustments and the decrease or low growth of the population in those countries. Within the EU-28, electricity consumption peaked in 2008, after which it began to decrease slowly, driven by a more pronounced decrease in the industry sector (see Fig.3). By 2014, the final energy consumption of electricity was 5.5 % below the 2008 level (before the recession) but still above the 1990 level.   In the non-EU EEA countries, Iceland, Norway and Turkey, electricity consumption increased between 1990 and 2014 by 0.5 % per year (Norway), 6.3 % per year (Iceland) and 6.5 % per year (Turkey). The growth of electricity consumption in non-EU EEA countries was dominated by the increased electricity consumption in Turkey. Here, the high consumption rate is due to Turkey's rapid transition to a modernised economy, with the associated increase in electricity generation and use. Between 2005 and 2014, there was a continued increase of 8.9 % per year for Iceland and 5.3 % per year for Turkey, while in Norway electricity consumption decreased by 0.2 % per year. Electricity consumption by sector The increase in electricity consumption since 1990 can be traced back to an increase in consumption in the services (83 %) and households (29 %) sectors (see Figure 3). Since 2005, electricity consumption in the services sector continued to increase (by 10 %), while electricity consumption in the household sector decreased by 2 %. Electricity consumption in industry also decreased (by 12 %) over the same period due to improvements in industrial processes and a slightly decrease in activity. In 2014:  Industry remained the largest electricity-consuming sector in the EU-28, accounting for 37 % of all electricity consumption (compared with 46 % in 1990). Between 1990 and 2005, electricity consumption in the industry sector increased by 0.9 % per year, while it decreased by an average of 1.4 % per year from 2005 to 2014. The services sector and the households sector come second, with each responsible for almost one third of all electricity consumption in the EU-28:  The consumption of electricity in the services sector was 30 % in 2014, compared with 20 % in 1990. It is the sector with the fastest growing consumption. Since 1990, electricity consumption in the service sector has increased by 82.8 %, at an average annual rate of 2.5 %. The main reasons for increased electricity consumption in the services sector were the sustained growth of this sector throughout the EU and the increased use of air conditioning and IT equipment (see ENER 037). Electricity consumption in the households sector accounted for 29 % of all electricity consumption in the EU-28, compared with 28 % in 1990. Between 1990 and 2014, electricity consumption in the household sector grew by 29 %, at an average annual rate of 1.1 %. Between 2005 and 2014, electricity consumption in the household sector actually decreased by 0.2 %. Improvements in the energy efficiency of large electrical appliances such as refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, dishwashers, TVs and dryers were offset by the use, number and size of large appliances as well as by a growing number of smaller appliances, including new IT appliances (explanatory factors for the energy consumption of households are shown in ENER 037).  The transport sector was responsible for only 2.3 % of all electricity consumption in the EU-28 in 2014 (2.9 % in 1990). Between 1990 and 2014, electricity consumption in the EU-28 transport sector increased from 5.5 Mtoe in 1990 to almost 6.3 Mtoe in 2002. After 2002, it decreased to slightly below the 1990 level (5.3 Mtoe in 2014). The increased consumption of electricity for transport purposes (railways) in some countries, such as France and Italy, counterbalanced a decrease in electricity consumed for railways in some new Member States, such as Poland and the Czech Republic. Agriculture, forestry and fishing were responsible for a mere 2 % of all electricity consumption in the EU-28 (2.6 % in 1990). Electricity consumption in these sectors decreased by 1 % per year between 1990 and 2005, and has been growing since 2005 at an average annual rate of 1.5 % (-0.1 % per year over the whole 1990-2014 period).   With regard to non-EU EEA countries, between 1990 and 2014, overall electricity consumption in all sectors increased by 357 % in Turkey, 331 % in Iceland and 12 % in Norway. The average rate of increase was 6.5 % per year, 6.3 % per year and 0.5 % per year, respectively. In the main sectors, the average growth rates recorded between 1990 and 2014 were:   Industry: 5.4 % per year (Turkey), 7.6 % per year (Iceland) and 0.04 % per year (Norway) Services: 8.9 % per year (Turkey), 3.2 % per year (Iceland) and 0.8 % per year (Norway)  Households: 7.0 % per year (Turkey), 1.6 % per year (Iceland) and 0.9 % per year (Norway).    In 2014, the share of electricity consumption in the agricultural, fishing and forestry sectors of Turkey, Iceland and Norway were 2.5 %, 1.6 % and 1.8 %, respectively. This constituted an average annual change of +8.1 % in Turkey, -0.2 % in Iceland and +4.6 % in Norway since 1990, and an annual rate of 2.6 % in Turkey, -1.0 % in Iceland and -0.7 % in Norway since 2005. For all three countries, electricity consumption in the transport sector had a share of less than 1 % in 2014. Electricity consumption per capita Electricity consumption per capita increased by 17 % in the EU-28 between 1990 (4 553 kWh/capita) and 2014 (5338 kWh/capita). The EU-wide consumption average varies greatly between countries, with a low per-capita consumption observed in some new Member States in 2014, including Romania (2 101 kWh/capita), Lithuania (3 138 kWh/capita), Latvia (3 289 kWh/capita), Poland (3 311 kWh/capita), Croatia (3493 kWh/capita) and Hungary (3 513 kWh/capita), and a high per-capita consumption observed in other Member States, including Finland (14 517 kWh/capita) and Sweden (12 669 kWh/capita). In Sweden, this is due to the high market penetration of electrical heating linked to the low-cost of hydropower produced electricity (see Figure 5 and ENER 037). The increasing use of air conditioning in southern European countries also contributes to a large increase in electricity consumption during the summer months. Between 1990 and 2014, electricity consumption per capita in non-EU EEA countries decreased at an average annual rate of 0.3 % in Norway, while it grew rapidly in Iceland and Turkey at an average annual rate of 5.2 % and 5.1 %, respectively. In 2014, per capita electricity consumption reached 21 224 kWh for Norway and 51724 kWh for Iceland, whereas for Turkey it was one order of magnitude smaller (2 680 kWh).,Electricity generation Between 1990 and 2014, gross electricity generation[1]in the EU-28 increased by 23 % at an average rate of 0.9 % per year. After2005, a small decrease of 0.5% per year has been observed.  [1]Gross electricity generation (also called electricity production) refers to gross generation in all types of power plants (not to be confused with final electricity consumption).  Contribution of fuels to 2014 electricity generation In 2014, electricity generation by fuelin the EU-28 was as follows (Figure 2):   29 % from renewables (compared with 13 % in 1990); 28 % from nuclear energy (compared with 31 % in 1990); 25 % from coal and lignite (compared with 39 % in 1990); 15 % from natural and derived gas (compared with 9 % in 1990); 2 % from oil (compared to 9 % with 1990); and 1 % from other fuels (unchanged from 1990).    Fossil fuel electricity generation Taken together, fossil fuels continue to dominate the EU-28 electricity mix, although their share ofgross electricity generation fell by 25 %, from 56 % in 1990 to 42 % in 2014.  Electricity generated from coal and lignite decreased by 21 % over the same period, at an average rate of 1 % per year. The reduction in the share of solid fuels was driven by changes in the prices of solid fuels compared with natural gas, as well as by support policies for renewables and more stringent environmental regulations. The electricity produced from natural and derived gas increased by 119 % between 1990 and 2014, at an average rate of 3 % per year. The use of these fuels increased rapidly between 1990 and 2005 (8 % per year) but, on average, it decreased from then on by 4 % per year. The observed coal-to-gas switch during the nineties was driven by several factors, including greater health and environmental concerns, consistently falling gas prices in the late 1980s and 1990s, and the attractiveness of combined-cycle gas plants[2]. Since 2008, the share of natural gas in electricity generation has declined by 9percentage points against the backdrop of increasing gas prices driven by the gas-to-oil price indexation, lower economic activity and low CO2prices under the EU-ETS.    [2]Combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGT) became more attractive due to a combination of factors, especially their relatively low capital expenditure (CAPEX), higher efficiency rate, the possibility to run the plants in a more flexible mode (i.e. start-up and shut-down operations) and favourable coal-gas price differentials since the late 1980s and early 1990s. Nuclear electricity generation Nuclear electricity increased by 10 % between 1990 and 2014, at an average annual rate of 0.4 %. A closer look at the trend reveals an increase between 1990 and 2005 of 1.5 % per year and, after 2005, an average decrease of 1.4 % per year. Nuclear electricity totally disappeared in Lithuania as a result of decommissioning the last nuclear reactor in 2009, but there are plans for a new nuclear power plant. Furthermore, nuclear electricity decreased between 2005 and 2014 in Germany (-5.6 % per year), Belgium (-3.8 %) and the United Kingdom (-2.7 %), while it increased in countries such as Romania (8.6 % per year), the Czech Republic (2.3 % per year) and Hungary (1.4 % per year). In the wake of the Fukushima accident of 2011, several countries plan to step up the decommissioning of nuclear power plants (e.g. Belgium, Germany, Spain and Switzerland, with Germany planning to decommission all of its nuclear plants by 2022 and Spain banning the construction of new reactors). Other countries, however, are still considering to increase their nuclear capacity (Romania, United Kingdom), have new nuclear power plants under construction (e.g. Bulgaria, Finland, France and Slovakia) or have paved the way to extend the lifetime of existing nuclear reactors (Sweden). However, the costs of nuclear electricity generation have increased since the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011 (e.g. by about 20 % in France between 2010 and 2013, because of investments in maintenance and safety measures). Renewable electricity generation The electricity produced from renewable sources increased by 184 % between 1990 and 2014 at an average annual rate of 4.5 %. After 2005, the rate increased to 7.3 % per year. The acceleration observed since 2005 occurred in the context of national and EU renewable energy support policies and significant cost reductions achieved by certain renewable energy technologies, such as solar photovoltaics in recent years. In 2014, 44 % of renewable electricity was generated from hydro (94 % in 1990), 27 % from wind (0 % in 1990), 18 % from biomass (4 % in 1990), 11 % from solar (0 % in 1990) and 1 % from geothermal (1 % in 1990). Carbon intensity of EU-28 electricity production In the light of the increased role of renewable electricity and the fuel shifts observed between 1990 and 2014, the carbon intensity of thetotal electricity generation in the EU-28 is over one third (36 %) lower today than in 1990 (decreasing from431 gCO2/kWh in 1990 to 276 gCO2/kWh in 2014) (Figure 1b). Between 2007 and 2014, the CO2 emissions per kWh generated decreased by 22 % on average (3.5 % per year). This was because of increased production efficiency and the transition from fossil fuels to renewables for the generation of electricity. The share of fossil fuels in gross electricity production decreased by 10 percentage points over this period. Member countries differ significantly with regard to the CO2 intensity of their electricity production.Greece (830 g CO2/kWh in 2014), Estonia (762 g CO2/kWh) and Malta (715 g CO2/kWh) had the highest intensities, as a result of the low amount of renewables and nuclear sources in their national electricity mixes. On the other hand, Sweden (10 g CO2/kWh in 2014), France (35 g CO2/kWh) and Austria (60 g CO2/kWh) had the lowest CO2 intensities for their electricity production. France (-80 %) and Austria (-69 %), together with Slovakia (-77 %) and Luxembourg (-69 %) had the highest decarbonisation rate in electricity production over the 1990-2014 period. Iceland, whose electricity production is entirely based on renewable energy sources (hydro power and geothermal energy), has zero CO2 emissions for its electricity production. The CO2 emission intensity from conventional thermal power stations and district heating decreased by one quarter in the EU-28 between 1990 (745 g CO2/kWh) and 2014 (558 g CO2/kWh) (Figure 1a) [HCW2]. This indicator only considers main activity power stations and heating plants and does not take into account electricity production from nuclear and renewable sources. On the contrary, it includes emissions for heating purposes. Between 1990 and 2010, the CO2 emissions per kWh generated decreased by 28 % on average (1.6 % per year). This was due to increased production efficiency and the transition from coal to gas for the generation of public electricity and heat. Since 2010, however, CO2 emission intensity has increased by 0.9 % per year, mainly due to an increase in the share of electricity and heat generated from coal and lignite at the expense of gas. Non-EU EEA member countries  An assessment of electricity generation for non-EU EEA countries could be performed for Iceland, Norway andTurkey for which energy data were available. In Turkey, electricity generation increased by 338 % between 1990 and 2014, at an average rate of 6.3 % per year. Between 2005 and 2014, electricity production increased by 5.0 % per year. Natural gas contributes almost half of the electricity production (49 %) in Turkey, followed by coal (29 %) and renewables (21 %). In Iceland, electricity generation increased by 302 % between 1990 and 2014, at an average rate of 6.0 % year. Between 2005 and 2014, electricity production increased by 8.5 % per year. All electricity produced in Iceland (100 %) comes from renewables (hydro and geothermal). In Norway, electricity generation increased by 17 % between 1990 and 2014, at an average rate of 0.6 % year. Between 2005 and 2014, electricity production decreased by 1.8 % per year. Renewables (mainly hydro) contribute to almost all electricity production in Norway (98 %)."
"climate-finance-resources-for-low  Climate finance: resources for low-carbon, climate-resilient Europe  Our climate is changing. We must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit the rate of climate change, and at the same time, take measures that help us prepare for current and future impacts. Both of these strands of action require unprecedented redirection of investments. This was acknowledged by the climate conferences in Paris and recently in Marrakesh. The finance sector can and will play an instrumental role in supporting Europe’s transition towards a low- carbon, climate-resilient society.   Europe needs to invest substantially in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Estimates of the actual amounts needed vary significantly and, depending on the scope, scale or methodology, can amount up to hundreds of billions of Euros per year. Compared to the overall financing capacity of the finance system, these investments needs are relatively small. Yet, despite its extensive capacity, the finance system currently meets only a fraction of the investment need.   The main challenges for boosting climate-friendly investments include, among others, overcoming existing barriers and lock-ins in the finance system which prolong and promote unsustainable activities; and redirecting funds towards initiatives that boost climate resilience and reduce carbon emissions. For coherent and effective measures on the ground, investment needs should be addressed in a systematic way at all levels — European, national and local. Coherent and complete disclosure of climate risks by companies is a pre-requisite for making informed investment decisions. In addition to improving transparency on climate risks, long-term planning and commitment also send clear signals to investors.   Clear policy signals facilitate long-term investments   The 2015 Paris agreement has set the global objective to ‘make all financial flows consistent with a pathway towards low-emissions, climate-resilient development’. This objective was also confirmed by the 2016 climate change conference in Marrakesh.   The  clean energy package , recently proposed by the European Commission, confirms the EU’s commitment to a low-carbon and climate-resilient transition. The package expounds the target of at least 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions and proposes the targets of at least 30% for energy efficiency and of at least 27% for renewable energy by 2030. It also highlights the important role that investments in clean energy transition and their economic co-benefits. According to the European Commission, by mobilising up to EUR 177 billion of public and private investment per year from 2021, the proposed package can generate up to a 1% increase in GDP over the next decade and create 900 000 new jobs.   The EU policy framework and targets are in general implemented through strategies and concrete actions in the countries, including the national Low Carbon Development Strategies. A preliminary assessment of these strategies by the EEA shows that they vary considerably in scope and depth as well as ambition level. They include very limited information on financing needs and plans to redirect investments. Moreover, a long-term vision at national level in line with EU’s decarbonisation targets is often lacking. Similarly, many countries have also adopted national adaptation strategies and action plans, but details on financing these are often not available. To strengthen investors’ confidence, the Low Carbon Development Strategies and national adaptation plans should be complemented with national climate financing strategies.

Hans Bruyninckx EEA Executive Director   The editorial published in the  EEA Newsletter 04/2016, December 2016    climate finance paris agreement climate and energy framework 2030,Europe needs to invest substantially in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Estimates of the actual amounts needed vary significantly and, depending on the scope, scale or methodology, can amount up to hundreds of billions of Euros per year. Compared to the overall financing capacity of the finance system, these investments needs are relatively small. Yet, despite its extensive capacity, the finance system currently meets only a fraction of the investment need. The main challenges for boosting climate-friendly investments include, among others, overcoming existing barriers and lock-ins in the finance system which prolong and promote unsustainable activities; and redirecting funds towards initiatives that boost climate resilience and reduce carbon emissions. For coherent and effective measures on the ground, investment needs should be addressed in a systematic way at all levels — European, national and local. Coherent and complete disclosure of climate risks by companies is a pre-requisite for making informed investment decisions. In addition to improving transparency on climate risks, long-term planning and commitment also send clear signals to investors. Clear policy signals facilitate long-term investments The 2015 Paris agreement has set the global objective to ‘make all financial flows consistent with a pathway towards low-emissions, climate-resilient development’. This objective was also confirmed by the 2016 climate change conference in Marrakesh. The clean energy package, recently proposed by the European Commission, confirms the EU’s commitment to a low-carbon and climate-resilient transition. The package expounds the target of at least 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions and proposes the targets of at least 30% for energy efficiency and of at least 27% for renewable energy by 2030. It also highlights the important role that investments in clean energy transition and their economic co-benefits. According to the European Commission, by mobilising up to EUR 177 billion of public and private investment per year from 2021, the proposed package can generate up to a 1% increase in GDP over the next decade and create 900 000 new jobs. The EU policy framework and targets are in general implemented through strategies and concrete actions in the countries, including the national Low Carbon Development Strategies. A preliminary assessment of these strategies by the EEA shows that they vary considerably in scope and depth as well as ambition level. They include very limited information on financing needs and plans to redirect investments. Moreover, a long-term vision at national level in line with EU’s decarbonisation targets is often lacking. Similarly, many countries have also adopted national adaptation strategies and action plans, but details on financing these are often not available. To strengthen investors’ confidence, the Low Carbon Development Strategies and national adaptation plans should be complemented with national climate financing strategies. Public sector investments will not be enough for financing the transition but can help mobilise and leverage private capital, which is indispensable for redirecting investment at the scale needed.

"air-quality-remains-a-hot  Air quality remains a hot topic for many Europeans  Last month the European Environment Agency (EEA) released its latest ‘Air quality in Europe’ report which showed that while air quality is slowly improving, air pollution remains the single largest environmental health hazard in Europe. We sat down with Alberto González Ortiz, an EEA air quality expert, to discuss the report’s findings and how technologies like satellite imagery are helping to improve air quality research.   What were the key findings of the 2016 report?   This year’s report highlights the fact that concentrations of air pollution across Europe continue to slowly improve. However, we are still seeing significant effects on health. Air pollution continues to result in a lower quality of life due to illnesses. Our updated report also provides a new estimate of the health impacts of the most harmful air pollutants like PM 2.5  which was responsible for estimated 467,000 premature deaths per year in 2013 across 41 European countries.   The health hazards of air pollution are well known, thanks to organisations like the World Health Organization, and people across Europe are increasingly aware that the problem is a serious one. We are exposed to it every day. You don’t see it but you can really feel it when air pollution levels are high.   What about road transport and air pollution in cities?    The report highlights the impact of road transport on air pollution, which has been in the news recently in connection with several European cities, including Paris and London.   Road transport is the main emitter of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) which is one of the main pollutants harming health. This pollutant is also a precursor of ozone and particulate matter that can form in the air. Transport is also an important source of primary particulate matter, not only due to fuel combustion, but also by the wear of tyres and brakes, and last but not least, transport is a very important source of greenhouse gas emissions.   Road transport also takes up a large part of our public spaces, take traffic congestion for example. It causes noise as well. So, it’s a multidimensional problem.   Of course, no one questions the important role transport and mobility play in our everyday lives, but getting around can be made more sustainable. We are seeing that many cities are already taking action across Europe, trying to set up more sustainable mobility systems. Measures like congestion charges are short-term remedies, so we have to consider longer-term fundamental and innovative changes to our transport system to improve our overall well-being.   The reports also draws attention to emissions from residential and commercial buildings. How big of a problem are they?    As far as wood stoves and fireplaces are concerned, it’s a bigger problem than people might think, particularly in winter time. Many people, especially in eastern and northern Europe, light their fireplaces or wood stoves, which emit a lot of PM 2.5 . Fuel combustion of all types for heating households, commercial and other institutional buildings is actually the largest emitter of PM 2.5 . The entire sector emits more than half of the total PM 2.5  at the European level.   Another problem in winter can be that in calm weather conditions, most of these emissions tend to hang and stay close to the ground because of thermal inversion. Under these conditions colder air stays in the lower layers of the atmosphere. Colder air, which is thicker, prevents the mixing and dispersion of emissions upwards in the atmosphere, so the pollution stays close to the ground.   What is the EEA doing to improve air quality in Europe?   One of the main contributions of the EEA is to provide the knowledge and the data required to help policy makers make better informed decisions on air quality. And our work also helps to raise public awareness of the problem, which is equally important.   We collect official data on air pollution from European countries, which we then use to make our regular air quality assessments via reports and indicators. We also share our air pollution data with many other stakeholders including the general public, national or regional authorities and the EU’s Copernicus satellite programme. And we participate regularly in seminars, conferences and meetings across Europe and internationally to share and discuss the issue and our findings, which help to spur action by policy makers. Air pollution is linked to a wide range of policy areas, so one of our priorities is to promote integrated cross-sectoral policies and measures.   Are any new technologies used to improve the monitoring of air pollution?   The vast majority of our data is collected through fixed air quality monitoring stations, which are operated by national and local authorities in our member countries. However, we are now seeing the use of other technologies as well, such as data collection by the use of satellites under the EU’s Copernicus programme. This is fairly new. The EEA works with Copernicus atmospheric services, and in the EEA air quality team, we also use some of this data in our work. By combining the information from satellites with modelling, we can get a better spatial distribution of pollutant concentrations. So instead of getting data at certain intervals from only certain measuring stations, we can get a much wider picture. But it’s essential to confirm model results with real-life observations, and this is where the EEA’s data received from countries across Europe is imperative.   We are also starting to see grass-roots, citizen-driven monitoring of air pollution with the use of sensors. It is a new source of information, but the accuracy of these devices still needs to be improved. They are not totally reliable yet, but it’s an emerging technology and it’s a great way of raising public awareness and community participation in addressing air pollution problems. At some point, this technology might become a good complementary source of information as well.        Alberto González Ortiz   The interview published in the  EEA Newsletter 04/2016, December 2016    copernicus health effects particulate ma greenhouse gas emissions nitrogen dioxide road transport world health organisation particle emissions carbon emissions air quality,What were the key findings of the 2016 report?

"term-2016-fundamental-changes-needed  TERM 2016: Fundamental changes needed for sustainable mobility   What changes are needed in order to move towards a more sustainable mobility system in Europe? A European Environment Agency (EEA) report released today assesses the latest environmental trends in transport and presents examples of the different transitions needed in terms of technology, urban planning and societal behaviour to make transport more sustainable.   The EEA report ‘ TERM 2016: Transitions towards a more sustainable mobility system ’ assesses the progress that European Union Member States are making to improve the environmental performance of transport in line with related EU policy targets. The report also looks at the big changes underway in the sector, from emerging technologies such as  electric  and driverless cars, to recent innovations that are becoming increasingly popular, such as shared or on-demand mobility services for commuters.   It is clear that Europe’s environment will continue to face transport-related pressures, such as air pollution, biodiversity fragmentation, traffic congestion, inefficient use of urban space and noise. Transport activity across Europe is expected to continue growing under current trends and policies. From 2010 to 2050, it is estimated that passenger transport will grow by about 40 %, with aviation as the fastest growing sector. Freight transport is expected to grow by 58 %. Consistent with these outlooks, greenhouse gas emissions under current policies are forecast to increase slightly between 2030 and 2050 to 15 % above 1990 levels, significantly higher than the  60 % reduction target proposed for 2050 . Reaching Europe’s long term environmental targets will therefore still require substantial efforts.   So what changes can society make to our mobility system to significantly improve its sustainability? The report stresses that while technological developments will continue to largely determine the future environmental performance of the transport sector, many past beneficial technological advances have historically been offset by the ever increasing demand for transport. Meeting decarbonisation and other environmental goals for the sector requires not only incremental changes such as improvements to the fuel efficiency of road vehicles, planes and ships, but also more far reaching changes, such as the widespread introduction of electric vehicles and changes to lifestyles and habits which greatly influence the way that society uses transport.   Looking to the future, the report identifies the scale of change required, in terms of transport’s environmental performance, in order to meet the EU’s long-term decarbonisation targets for 2050. It also looks at the strong links and interdependencies between the transport system and the food, land use and tourism sectors. Various barriers and ‘lock-ins’ that can hold up or delay the shift to a more sustainable mobility system are presented. One clear example of a ‘lock-in’ is society’s continued dependence on the fossil-fuel powered internal combustion engine, coupled with continued investments in traditional road transport infrastructure, which can hamper efforts to shift to more sustainable modes of transport.   Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism (TERM)   The annual TERM reports published by EEA use the latest available European data in order to assess key trends, measures and overall progress of the transport sector towards its environmental policy targets. Each year, the reports also address a specific issue. Recent TERM reports have for example evaluated the environmental impacts associated with urban and long-distance transport, the impact of transport on air quality, and the effect of transport policies on the past evolution of the sector and its pressures on the environment.       Related content      TERM transport indicator fact sheets                  transport and environment reporting mechanism sustainable transport transport indicators shipping low carbon transport aviation eu emission standards for road vehicles clean transport,The EEA report ‘TERM 2016: Transitions towards a more sustainable mobility system’ assesses the progress that European Union Member States are making to improve the environmental performance of transport in line with related EU policy targets.

"exceedances-of-air-quality-objectives-9  Exceedances of air quality objectives due to traffic        It is still a challenge to achieve good air quality levels in Europe, especially in urban areas with high volumes of road traffic.   Despite considerable improvements over recent decades, air pollution is still responsible for around 467 000 premature deaths in Europe each year. It also continues to damage vegetation and ecosystems.   Transport contributes significantly to the emission of many air pollutants and the resulting poor air quality, particularly in urban areas with high road traffic volumes.   The annual EU limit value for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2  ), one of the main air quality pollutants of concern and typically associated with vehicle emissions, was widely exceeded across Europe in 2014, with 94 % of all exceedances occurring at roadside monitoring locations.    In 2014, 16% of the EU-28 urban population were exposed to PM 10  levels above the EU daily limit value, whereas 8% were exposed to PM  2.5  levels above the EU target value.In 2014, transport also contributed to15 % and24 % of the total PM  10   and PM  2.5   primary emissions, respectively, in the EU Member States. Non-exhaust emissions are estimated to be about 50 % of the exhaust emissions of primary PM  10  and about34 % of those of primary PM  2.5  .                  pm10 transport air pollution   TERM TERM004 004,Air quality in urban areas is significantly influenced by local road traffic. While considerable progress has been made over the past twenty years in improving urban air quality, a number of issues remain.Despite considerable improvements, air pollution is still responsible for more than 467 000 premature deaths in Europe each year. It also continues to damage vegetation and ecosystems.Since the late 1990s, concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10) in urban areas have not declined in line with emission trends. Although emissions from transport have been declining, there are still many areas where limit values forNO2 andPM10 are exceeded across Europe, mainly due to road traffic.  For example, the annual EU limit value for NO2, one of the main air quality pollutants of concern and one typically associated with vehicle emissions, was widely exceeded across Europe in 2014, with 94 % of all exceedances occurring at roadside monitoring locations. Also, in 2014, about 16 % of the EU28 urban population was exposed toPM10 levels above the EU daily limit value. The disparity between trends in emission estimates and ground level concentrations of these pollutants can be partly explained by the difference between the laboratory and realworld emission performances of vehicles. However, there are further specific features of traffic and the urban environment that add to this disparity. For example,an increase inNO2emitted directly into the air from diesel vehicles (the proportion ofNO2in the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions of a diesel vehicle is far higher than the proportion ofNO2in the NOxemissions of a conventional-petrol vehicle) has been reported. Some cities in Europe recorded an increase in NO2 concentrations measured close to traffic, mainly because of the increasing number of diesel vehicles. Moreover, vehicle composition in urban areas is generally different to national composition. Actions to improve air quality need to take account of local composition to ensure targeted measures are implemented. For example, buses, mopeds and motorcycles make up a higher proportion of vehicle composition in urban areas than they do nationally. Buses can emit high levels of NOx and PM unless measures are taken to ensure they meet strict emission standards. Mopeds and motorcycles are high emitters of carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organiccompounds (VOC), particularly older models. In addition, 'slow, stop and start' congested urban traffic conditions and frequent short journeys can result in higher emissions per kilometre compared with free-flowing longer journeys. This is a consequence of increased cold engine operation, and the higher fuel consumption and less efficient performance of exhaust emission abatement systems. Measures to reduce traffic congestion may therefore also benefit air quality in the immediate area, although the full impacts need to be assessed over a wider area to ensure that traffic and emissions are not simply moved elsewhere. Other characteristics of the urban environment can increase the impact of traffic emissions on air quality. For example, the presence of high buildings on either side of roads, common in many city centres, creates a 'street canyon', which reduces the dispersion of the pollutants emitted from traffic sources and can lead to significantly higher concentrations locally. The monitoring data reported by the countries (Air Quality e-Reporting Database (http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/aqereporting)) provide the basis for estimating exposure of the urban European population to exceedances of the most stringent European air quality standards and WHO guidelines. Exposure is estimated based on concentrations measured at all urban and suburban background monitoring stations for most of the urban population, and at traffic stations for populations living within 100 m of major roads. The methodology is described by the EEA indicator, Exceedance of air quality limit values in urban areas (Indicator CSI 004)."
"fluorinated-gases-continue-to-be  Fluorinated gases continue to be phased down in Europe  The production, import and export of fluorinated-gases (F-gases) continued to decline in the European Union, according to a new report published today by the European Environment Agency (EEA). F-gases, which are mainly used in cooling and heating equipment, have a high global warming potential and their phase-down is therefore essential to global efforts to mitigate climate change.   F-gases were in many cases introduced to replace chemicals that were found to be harming the ozone layer. Currently, F-gases are mainly used in refrigerators, heat pumps and air-conditioning equipment in buildings and in cars.   The EEA report  ‘Fluorinated greenhouse gases 2015 ’ tracks progress towards the EU target of reducing F-gas emissions by two thirds by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. According to the report, the production, imports, exports and supply of F-gases in the EU decreased in 2015, both in physical amounts as well as in amounts weighted by the global warming potential of the gas in question, measured in CO 2 -equivalent tonnes (CO 2 -eq.).   The F-gas share of the global warming potential of the EU’s overall greenhouse gas emissions was 3 % in 2014, but this share has been on the increase. Curbing F-gas emissions is therefore an important part of the EU’s overall commitment to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 40 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.   Large reductions in F-gas use and emissions are expected from a new phase-down measure, which will progressively cap the sales of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) on the EU market down to 21 % of baseline levels by 2030. Furthermore, bans on the use of F-gases that have a high global warming potential are expected to result in additional reductions.   The Montreal Protocol to reduce the production and consumption of ozone depleting substances was amended to regulate HFCs, in October 2016, in Kigali, Rwanda. Both developed and developing countries have taken on mandatory commitments to reduce production and consumption of HFCs in the next three decades.   Key findings of ‘Fluorinated greenhouse gases 2015’, based on reporting by companies in the EU:     Production of F-gases in the EU declined by 5 % (as  CO  2  -eq. ) in 2015.   F-gas imports to the EU decreased by about 40 %, compared with the exceptionally high amounts reported in 2014 (both by weight and as  CO  2  -eq. ).   EU exports of F-gases decreased by 2 % (by weight) or 1 % ( CO  2  -eq. ) compared with 2014. However, compared to 2013, exports in 2015 increased by 18 % (by weight) and 23 % ( CO  2  -eq. ).   Supply of F-gases in the EU decreased by about 24 % (by weight and as  CO  2  -eq. ) since 2014.     f-gases ozone depleting substances air and climate climate change,F-gases were in many cases introduced to replace chemicals that were found to be harming the ozone layer.

"assessment  Waste recycling   Latest available trends show that recycling ratesfor both municipal waste and packaging waste have increased substantially: recycling rates for municipal waste increased by 13 percentage points between 2004 and 2014, and recycling rates for packaging waste by 10 percentage points between 2005 and 2013. In 2014, 43 % of the municipal waste generated in the EU-27 and Norway was recycled, while in 2013, 65 % of packaging waste generated was recycled. These improvements are, among others, driven by EU targets for the recycling of these two waste streams introduced in 1994 and 2008, respectively. Higher overall recycling rates for packaging waste compared to municipal waste probably result from the earlier introduction of packaging waste targets, producer responsibility schemes and the relative ease of recycling packaging waste from commercial sources.   For municipal waste, large differences in recycling rates between European countries prevail; in 2014, the rates ranged from 64 % in Germany to 1 % in Serbia. In six countries, recycling rates were equal or higher than 50 %, while five countries recycled less than 20 %.  In 2014, 24 countries recycled 55 % or morepackaging waste  and overall recycling rates ranged from 81 % in Belgium to 41 % in Malta. These differences indicate a large potential for improvement.   packaging waste soer2015 cross-country comparisons soer2015 recycling rate material recycling waste municipal waste       CSI CSI052 WST WST005 052 005,A key principle of EU waste legislation is to move waste management up the waste hierarchy (i.e. waste prevention, preparing for reuse, recycling, other methods of recovery and disposal). This approach is a key way to extract more value from resources, and recycling plays a crucial role. The main aim is to increasingly meet the material demand of the economy by using secondary raw materials made of recycled waste, preventing the environmental impacts associated with extracting and refining virgin materials, and contributing to the security of supply. This indicator shows how theprogress Europe is making towards the goal to recycle more waste, using municipal solid waste (in the text called municipal waste) and packaging waste as examples. For these two waste streams, legally binding quantitative targets for recycling exist in EU legislation. The Waste Framework Directive sets a target of 50 % of municipal waste (more precisely the target applies to specific types of household and similar wastes) to be recycled by 2020 in individual countries (except Turkey and Switzerland). The Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (94/62/EC) requires EU Member States to recycle at least 55 % of packaging waste by 2008. Several countries have different target years for meeting the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive targets: 2012 for the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Lithuania, Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia; 2013 for Malta; 2014 for Poland; 2015 for Latvia. In addition, Romania and Bulgaria have been granted specific derogations, defined in their respective Treaties of Accession. In December 2015, the European Commission proposed a new set of more ambitious targets for recycling of both municipal and packaging waste, as part of its circular economy strategy. The recycling rate of municipal waste grew continuously by 13 percentage points in the EU-27 countries and Norway in the period 2004-2014 (Figure 1), which clearly indicates improvements in waste management. In 2014, 43 % of municipal waste generated in the EU-27 and Norway was recycled, including both material recycling and composting, and anaerobic digestion. The difference in municipal waste recycling performance between the countries with the highest and lowest recycling rates is large. In 2014, rates ranged from 64 % in Germany to 1 % in Serbia (Figure 2). Six countries, notably Germany, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden, achieved (in descending order) recycling rates of 50 % or higher, while another six countries recycled less than 20 %, including two countries with less than 10 %. Ten countries  the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia and the United Kingdom  made substantial progress, with an increase in recycling rates of over 15 percentage points between 2004 and 2014. In nine countries, the share of recycled municipal waste has barely changed since 2004 (less than five percentage points change). It is important to note that these recycling rates cannot be used to assess the countries progress against the 50 % recycling target of the Waste Framework Directive, because countries can choose between four different methods to calculate compliance with the target. The data shown in figures 1 and 2 only show recycling rates according to one of those methods, the only one where time-series data is available. Moreover, the target in the Waste Framework Directive includes preparing for reuse while this is not included in the data used in this indicator. Developments in the area of packaging waste are similar to those in municipal waste: the recycling rate of packaging waste grew from 55 % in 2004 to 65 % in 2013, i.e. by 10 percentage points in the EU-27 and Norway (Figure 1).  At the county level, 24 countries recycled 55 % or more of their packaging waste in 2014 (Figure 3). The recycling rate in 2014 varied from 81 % in Belgium to 41 % in Malta, but on average, the differences (measured as standard deviation) in recycling rates between countries has decreased since 2004. The highest increases since 2004 were of over 30 percentage points and they occurred in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Malta and Slovenia, which indicates that these countries have caught up quickly. Another nine countries managed to increase their recycling rates by more than 15 percentage points. In Austria, Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg - countries with high recycling rates already in 2004 - recycling increased by less than five percentage points. Hungary and Malta missed their targets in 2014, Greece in 2013, and Iceland in 2012. Greece and Iceland had to meet the target by 2008, Hungary by 2012, and Malta by 2013. It seems that the introduction and implementation of EU and national policies and targets have acted as drivers for the improvements made in the past years. However, regional and local policies within countries continue to play a significant role in the process. Recycling rates for packaging waste are consistently higher than for municipal waste, and differences in recycling rates between countries are higher for municipal waste than for packaging waste (measured as standard deviation). One reason for this is that targets for packaging waste recycling were already introduced in 1994, with 2001 and 2008 as target years, while the recycling target for municipal waste was only introduced in 2008 and has to be met by 2020. In addition, the target for packaging waste is more ambitious than that for municipal waste. The majority of countries introduced producer responsibility schemes for packaging waste, thus creating a mechanism for moving towards the targets. Moreover, packaging waste from households was, in many countries, the first waste type targeted for recycling of municipal waste. Finally, packaging waste from commercial sources is easier to recycle because it contains larger and cleaner streams than municipal waste. However, it should be kept in mind that the two waste streams overlap as municipal waste includes packaging waste from households and similar sources. All in all, while there is considerable progress reported by the countries for both waste streams, there is still room for further improvement - both for packaging and municipal waste - on the road to a circular economy."

Policy targets and progress    In line with the 7th EAP objective, the overall aim of the EU Biodiversity Strategy (EC, 2011) includes halting the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services in the EU by 2020. The EU Birds and Habitats Directives (EU, 1992 and 2009) aim to ensure that species of European interest are maintained or restored to good status throughout their natural range within the EU. Target 1 of the Biodiversity Strategy sets out the specific goal that, by 2020, 34% of species assessed under the Habitats Directive should have a favourable or improved conservation status, and that 78% of species assessed under the Birds Directive should have a secure or improved status.   The latest assessments (covering the 20072012 period) for the conservation status and trends for species under the Habitats Directive show that the total proportion of these species having either favourable (23%) or improved (4%) status was 27% (the adjusted 2020 target is 34.5%). A total of 22% are still deteriorating and 14% are without a known trend.   As can be seen inFigure1, the majority of species are assessed as being in unfavourable status (60%). For all taxonomic groups, moreover, the number of species whose status is deteriorating is significantly higher than those whose status is improving towards favourable status. The largest negative trend is observed in fish, molluscs and amphibians. With more than 66% of assessments categorised as unknown and only 7% as favourable, the status of marine species gives rise to particular concern.      Figure 1: Conservation status and trends for species assessed as unfavourable under the Habitats Directive (2007-2012), EU         For birds, the total proportion of species assessments with either secure status (52%) or non-secure but improving status (8.5%) was around 61% of species (the target for 2020 is 78%). The proportion of secure species did not change compared with the assessment in 2004 (EC, 2015; EEA, 2015a).   The EU population status of bird species (see Figure2)indicates that around 15% are near threatened, declining or depleted, while another 17% of species are threatened. It should also be noted that the EU population status for another 17% of bird species remains unknown. Populations of some common birds appear to be stabilising but other species  especially those linked to fragile freshwater, coastal and agricultural ecosystems  continue to decline (EC, 2015).        Figure 2: EU population status of bird species        There has been limited progress, with recovery of some species due to dedicated conservation efforts and improved site management. The EU-wide network of nature conservation areas (Natura 2000) has been expanded to cover 18% of EU land and is now considered complete (the coverage of protected marine areas has increased to 6% but still requires additional effort). Conserving and managing the Natura 2000 network effectively through implementation of conservation measures under the Birds and Habitats Directives is central to improving the conservation status of EU protected species. It is also important to enhance the networks coherence through developing green infrastructure, such as wildlife corridors.   Nonetheless, EU protected species continue to face many pressures: the highest ranked pressures and threats to terrestrial species are reported to be agriculture (including both intensification and abandonment) and changes to hydrology (especially in wetlands) (EEA, 2015a). Many of these threats and pressures arise from a wide range of sectors and policies (including agriculture, fisheries, forestry, transport etc.) and are expected to continue. Consequently, the fate of European biodiversity is closely intertwined with developments in these areas, including implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy reform. The adequate integration of biodiversity considerations into certain economic sectors and regional policies therefore remains critical in attempting to reduce pressures on biodiversity (EEA, 2015b).   Given the limited progress in improving the conservation status of species and the ongoing cumulative pressures on their habitats, it is unlikely that the 2020 target will be met.    Country level information    At the EU Member States level, almost half of the countries have 30% or less of species assessments considered asfavourable, and only four Member States (Ireland, Bulgaria, Estonia and Cyprus) have more than 50% of species assessments as favourable (see Figure3). Theproportion of species assessments classified as unfavourabledeclining exceeds 20% innine countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Italy, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden, while for Italy up to 40% of its species assessments are classified as unfavourabledeclining (see Figure3).       Figure 3: Conservation status and trends of species assessed under the Habitats Directive (2007-2012), by country        Outlook beyond 2020   Dedicated conservation efforts under the Habitats and Birds Directives can be expected to result in the recovery of some species, but achieving favourable conservation status for all EU protected species in the longer term is very challenging. Many species are expected to continue their decline beyond 2020 since widespread pressures are expected to be ongoing. Intensification of agriculture is expected to continue or increase in Eastern Europe, for example, and some pressures (including climate change and invasive alien species) are set to increase. The fate of marine species is a particular concern given the high proportion of unknown assessments and given also that a substantial increase in the network of marine protected areas still needs to be implemented.   About the indicator   This indicator covers the status of and trends in: (1) around 450 wild bird species that are naturally present in the EU (Birds Directive, EU, 2009); and (2) more than 1250 other species of wild animals and plants (Habitats Directive, EU, 1992) considered to be rare, threatened or endemic. The protected species are often collectively referred to as species of European interest. They cover many taxonomic groups, trophic levels and habitats.   Conservation status of species under the Habitats Directive is assessed every 6 years (latest period 20072012) at the national and EU biogeographical levels. Population status of species of the Birds Directive is also assessed every 6 years (latest period 20082012) at the EU level.   Assessments cover the status of the species and their evolution during this period (trend). The indicator thus reflects combined results forboth status and trend.   For bird species, the population status is categorised as secured, near threatened, declining or depleted, threatened or unknown, and conservation trends (for near threatened, declining or depleted and threatened species) categorised as increasing, stable, fluctuating, deteriorating, or unknown.

This briefing presents trends in EPE; promotingactivities and technologies aimed at preventing pollution and environmental degradation can reduce the environmental and climate impacts of economic activity. This can also lead to economic development via growth and increasing employment in the environmental goods and services sector (EGSS) ( AIRS_PO2.12, 2016 ). 1  However, increased spending can also reflect responses to growing environmental pressures and impacts on the environment.          Policy targets and progress        The 7th EAP Priority Objective 6 identifies the need to increase both public and private sector environment and climate-related expenditure.EPE has grown over the 20032013 period by 18% in real terms, although most of this growth took place before 2008 (Figure1). The proportions of expenditure of the public sector, industry and specialised producers (a mixture of public and privately run environmental specialist services such as waste and wastewater companies) remained relatively constant over the same period. Specialised producers accounted for half of total expenditure, industry for 20% and the public sector for 30%. Expenditure by industry has lagged behind the other two sectors, growing at half the speed.   Overall EPE experienced a dip due to the financial crisis and did not recover to 2008 levels in real terms (fixed prices) until 2011. However, the reduction was mainly driven by industry and specialised providers. Public expenditure actually increased during and immediately following the crisis as governments in EU Member States tried tostabilisetheir economies by increasing investments, includinggreen investments (Grlach et al., 2014). This increasing trend in EPE in the public sector also protected the EGSS in Europe from the economic downturn ( AIRS_PO2.12, 2016 ). 1  However, it should be noted that the main reason for growth in the EGSS was a continuous increase in renewable energy activities, and the EPE indicator does not capture this.       Figure 1. Trends in EU-28 environmental protection expenditure by organisation type, in absolute value (2010 fixed prices) and proportion of GDP          Public expenditure on environment activities as part of policy interventions to stabilise economies also affected the proportion of overall EPE in GDP. This showed a 7% increase over the 20032013 period with a peak in 2009, following 2 years of increased government expenditure (from EUR85 billion in 2007 to EUR90 billion in 2009), while the overall economy shrank. Public sector EPE then dropped toEUR86 billion in 2010 (at 2010 prices),then stagnated after 2009 as the economy began to grow again, reducing the EPE proportion of GDP to 2006 levels by 2013.    Figure 2. Environmental protection expenditure by specialised producers and the public sector split by environmental domain, EU        Figure2 shows EPE trends according to environmental domain in the same period. Data are available only for the public sector and specialised producers (approximately 80% of overall EPE).   Most expenditure was on waste management, followed by wastewater treatment. The growth in EPE has been driven primarily by growth in waste management expenditure. EPE related to air pollution and climate was very limited but this is in part due to industry expenditure not being included in the figures. If this was included, it would add an extra EUR12 billion EPE in 2013, in addition to the EUR4 billion spent on air and climate, as shown in Figure2 (Eurostat, 2015a).    The EPE will only partly capture climate-related expenditure. Nevertheless, given current EU budgetallocation commitments and the clear increase in EPE since 2003, it seems unlikely that this trend will be reversed by 2020. Therefore, the prospects for increased environmental expenditure by 2020 appear positive.        Country level information          Figure3 shows  developments at country level in total EPE as percentages of GDP in the 20032013 period, where data are available. While trends varied between countries, of the 11 countries with data for all 3 years, eight saw increasing proportions of GDP.      Figure 3. Environmental protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP        EPE as a proportion of GDP varies strongly across countries.Austria, Estonia, Italy and Romania have proportions over 3% whileSerbia and Turkey have proportions lower than 0.75% (Figure3). This wide gap reflects differences in economic structure (e.g. type of industry, type of energy sources used). In most countries, public sector expenditure is concentrated on waste management and wastewater treatment.   The division between EPE current expenditure and investment differs across countries according to the date when they entered the EU. For Member States that have joined the EU since 2004, investment accounts for more than 35% of total EPE. Thisexpenditurecan be explained by the new fixed assets necessary to meet EU water quality and waste management directives.    Outlook beyond 2020    Progress towards a circular economy will require increases in investments and current expenditure in the waste management sector, but also within the business sector as a whole, to close resource loops. The EU intends to invest EUR5.5 billion of structural funds in accelerating the circular economy (EC, 2015). This could also provide a catalyst for expenditure by the public sector and businesses in Member States up to and beyond 2020.   The EUs agreed long-term target (EC, 2014) for further reducing greenhouse gas emissions (a 40% reduction compared with 1990 by 2030) also implies additional investments, not all of which will be captured by the EPE indicator. The air quality targets for 2030 proposed by theEuropean Commission in late 2013 (A Clean Air Programme for Europe; EC, 2013b) could also lead to an increase in EPE beyond 2020. Additional efforts will be needed beyond 2020 to achieve the water quality targets of the Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000) which are also likely to be reflected in an increase in EPE.   About the indicator   This briefing uses data from the environmental protection expenditure account (EPEA), which is one of the European environmental accounts. Environmental accounts analyse the interaction between the economy and the environment by organising environmental information in a way that is consistent with national accounts.EPE illustrates the investments aimed at preventing, reducing and eliminating pollution and environmental degradation. The EPE indicator estimates country spending on these activities in fixed prices (2010 reference year) in euros and as a percentage of GDP.   EPE data are available by environmental domain (protection of ambient air and climate; wastewater management; waste management; protection and remediation of soil, groundwater and surface water; noise and vibration abatement; protection of biodiversity and landscape; protection against radiation; research and development; and other environmental protection activities). EPE data are also available by type of organisation (public, industrial and specialist producers, which can be a mixture of public and privately run environmental specialist services such as waste management companies etc.). EPE can also be split between investments and current (ongoing) expenditure.   European environmental accounts are established by Regulation 691/2011 on European environmental economic accounts.From 2017, reporting of data on the EPEA will be mandatory and standardised. Currently, data on expenditure by certain sectors, particularly industry, is missing in some years for some countries, and in these cases it is estimated by Eurostat. Moreover, industry EPE data broken down by environmental domain are missing.    Although the EPEA includes investment in reducing air pollutants (including greenhouse gases), it does not capture investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency or any form of climate adaptation.

This can also lead to economic development via growth and increasing employment in the environmental goods and services sector (EGSS) (AIRS_PO2.12, 2016).1 However, increased spending can also reflect responses to growing environmental pressures and impacts on the environment.   Policy targets and progress   The 7th EAP Priority Objective 6 identifies the need to increase both public and private sector environment and climate-related expenditure.EPE has grown over the 20032013 period by 18% in real terms, although most of this growth took place before 2008 (Figure1). The proportions of expenditure of the public sector, industry and specialised producers (a mixture of public and privately run environmental specialist services such as waste and wastewater companies) remained relatively constant over the same period. Specialised producers accounted for half of total expenditure, industry for 20% and the public sector for 30%. Expenditure by industry has lagged behind the other two sectors, growing at half the speed. Overall EPE experienced a dip due to the financial crisis and did not recover to 2008 levels in real terms (fixed prices) until 2011. However, the reduction was mainly driven by industry and specialised providers. Public expenditure actually increased during and immediately following the crisis as governments in EU Member States tried tostabilisetheir economies by increasing investments, includinggreen investments (Grlach et al., 2014). This increasing trend in EPE in the public sector also protected the EGSS in Europe from the economic downturn (AIRS_PO2.12, 2016).1 However, it should be noted that the main reason for growth in the EGSS was a continuous increase in renewable energy activities, and the EPE indicator does not capture this.  Figure 1. Trends in EU-28 environmental protection expenditure by organisation type, in absolute value (2010 fixed prices) and proportion of GDP  Public expenditure on environment activities as part of policy interventions to stabilise economies also affected the proportion of overall EPE in GDP. This showed a 7% increase over the 20032013 period with a peak in 2009, following 2 years of increased government expenditure (from EUR85 billion in 2007 to EUR90 billion in 2009), while the overall economy shrank. Public sector EPE then dropped toEUR86 billion in 2010 (at 2010 prices),then stagnated after 2009 as the economy began to grow again, reducing the EPE proportion of GDP to 2006 levels by 2013. Figure 2. Environmental protection expenditure by specialised producers and the public sector split by environmental domain, EU  Figure2 shows EPE trends according to environmental domain in the same period. Data are available only for the public sector and specialised producers (approximately 80% of overall EPE). Most expenditure was on waste management, followed by wastewater treatment. The growth in EPE has been driven primarily by growth in waste management expenditure. EPE related to air pollution and climate was very limited but this is in part due to industry expenditure not being included in the figures. If this was included, it would add an extra EUR12 billion EPE in 2013, in addition to the EUR4 billion spent on air and climate, as shown in Figure2 (Eurostat, 2015a).  The EPE will only partly capture climate-related expenditure. Nevertheless, given current EU budgetallocation commitments and the clear increase in EPE since 2003, it seems unlikely that this trend will be reversed by 2020. Therefore, the prospects for increased environmental expenditure by 2020 appear positive.   Country level information   Figure3 shows developments at country level in total EPE as percentages of GDP in the 20032013 period, where data are available. While trends varied between countries, of the 11 countries with data for all 3 years, eight saw increasing proportions of GDP.  Figure 3. Environmental protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP  EPE as a proportion of GDP varies strongly across countries.Austria, Estonia, Italy and Romania have proportions over 3% whileSerbia and Turkey have proportions lower than 0.75% (Figure3). This wide gap reflects differences in economic structure (e.g. type of industry, type of energy sources used). In most countries, public sector expenditure is concentrated on waste management and wastewater treatment. The division between EPE current expenditure and investment differs across countries according to the date when they entered the EU. For Member States that have joined the EU since 2004, investment accounts for more than 35% of total EPE. Thisexpenditurecan be explained by the new fixed assets necessary to meet EU water quality and waste management directives. Outlook beyond 2020 Progress towards a circular economy will require increases in investments and current expenditure in the waste management sector, but also within the business sector as a whole, to close resource loops. The EU intends to invest EUR5.5 billion of structural funds in accelerating the circular economy (EC, 2015). This could also provide a catalyst for expenditure by the public sector and businesses in Member States up to and beyond 2020. The EUs agreed long-term target (EC, 2014) for further reducing greenhouse gas emissions (a 40% reduction compared with 1990 by 2030) also implies additional investments, not all of which will be captured by the EPE indicator. The air quality targets for 2030 proposed by theEuropean Commission in late 2013 (A Clean Air Programme for Europe; EC, 2013b) could also lead to an increase in EPE beyond 2020. Additional efforts will be needed beyond 2020 to achieve the water quality targets of the Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000) which are also likely to be reflected in an increase in EPE. About the indicator This briefing uses data from the environmental protection expenditure account (EPEA), which is one of the European environmental accounts. Environmental accounts analyse the interaction between the economy and the environment by organising environmental information in a way that is consistent with national accounts.EPE illustrates the investments aimed at preventing, reducing and eliminating pollution and environmental degradation. The EPE indicator estimates country spending on these activities in fixed prices (2010 reference year) in euros and as a percentage of GDP. EPE data are available by environmental domain (protection of ambient air and climate; wastewater management; waste management; protection and remediation of soil, groundwater and surface water; noise and vibration abatement; protection of biodiversity and landscape; protection against radiation; research and development; and other environmental protection activities). EPE data are also available by type of organisation (public, industrial and specialist producers, which can be a mixture of public and privately run environmental specialist services such as waste management companies etc.). EPE can also be split between investments and current (ongoing) expenditure. European environmental accounts are established by Regulation 691/2011 on European environmental economic accounts.From 2017, reporting of data on the EPEA will be mandatory and standardised. Currently, data on expenditure by certain sectors, particularly industry, is missing in some years for some countries, and in these cases it is estimated by Eurostat. Moreover, industry EPE data broken down by environmental domain are missing.  Although the EPEA includes investment in reducing air pollutants (including greenhouse gases), it does not capture investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency or any form of climate adaptation. Therefore it does not fully capture expenditure to achieve climate policy objectives. "

According to a scenario assuming that current legislation is fully implemented, it will, nevertheless, fall short of the 2020 objective             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016             Setting the Scene    The 7th EAP ( EU, 2013 ) includes the objective of reducing the impact of air pollution on ecosystems and biodiversity, with the long-term aim of not exceeding critical loads and levels. Currently, the most important impact of air pollution on ecosystems and biodiversity is eutrophication caused by airborne nitrogen pollution.Excessive atmospheric deposition of nitrogen to ecosystems results in loss of sensitive species, increased growth of species that benefit from high nutrient levels, changes to habitat structure and function, the homogenisation of vegetation types, etc.    Policy targets and progress    The EU Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution includes an objective for 2020 of a 43% reduction in areas or ecosystems exposed to eutrophication, i.e. areas where eutrophication critical loads are exceeded  (  EC, 2005 a ) . The reference measure for this objective is the area in exceedance in 2000 ( EC, 2005 b). This is in line with the long-term objective of not exceeding critical loads.    In 2000, the area of ecosystems where the critical load was exceeded was almost 70% of the total in the EU Member States (approximately 60% in all 33 EEA member countries for which data were available, including the 28 EU Member States) and decreased in 2010 to 63% in the EU (55% in all 33 EEA member countries). Assuming that current legislation is fully implemented, the area in exceedance is projected to be 54% in the EU (48% in all 33 EEA member countries) in 2020 ( EEA, 2015 ). The reduction is approximately 15% for the EU, as well as for all the 33 EEA member countries, between 2000 and 2020, which is below the 43% reduction milestone suggested by the air pollution thematic strategy for this period.   Nevertheless, as illustrated in Figure 1, the magnitude (though not the area) of the exceedance is projected to reduce considerably in most areas, except for a few hot spot areas, particularly in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as in northern Italy. The risk of eutrophication increases slightly when only Natura 2000 protected areas are addressed ( EEA, 2014 ).   Figure 1.Exposure of ecosystems to eutrophication  area and magnitude of exceedance in 2000 and 2020              Source:  CCE (Coordination Centre for Effects), UNECE.      Note: The maps show areas where critical loads for eutrophication of freshwater and terrestrial habitats are exceeded    The main sources of eutrophication are emissions of nitrogen compounds to the atmosphere. Nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emissions for the EU decreased by approximately 43% between 2000 and 2014 ( EEA, 2016a ). This reduction has been primarily due to the introduction of three-way catalytic converters for cars. However, emission reductions from modern vehicles have not been as large as was originally anticipated. Standard diesel vehicles, for example, can emit up to seven times more NO x  in realworld conditions than in official tests ( EEA, 2016 b).   NH 3  emissions have not fallen by as much. In 2014, they had fallen by approximately 9% compared with their value in 2000 for the EU. Agriculture dominates emissions of NH 3  ( AIRS_PO3.2, 2016 ). 1 ; they amount to approximately 95% of total emissions in the EEA-33 region. Emissions primarily arise from the decomposition of urea in animal wastes and uric acid in poultry wastes.   A key driver behind the observed reductions was the implementation of the National Emission Ceilings Directive ( EU, 2001 ), which regulates, inter alia, emissions of the eutrophying air pollutants NO x  and NH 3 . However, eutrophying emissions not only from the agriculture and road transport sectors but also from shipping and air travel have been and will remain significant contributors to eutrophication caused by air pollution.   Further reductions in eutrophying air pollutant emissions are expected, inter alia, as a result of the 2012 amended Gothenburg Protocol, which sets air pollutant emission ceilings for 2020 ( UNECE, 2012 ). Nevertheless, as illustrated by the results of the current legislation scenario (Figure 1), the decreases anticipated for 2020 are not expected to contribute sufficiently to reductions in the ecosystem area exposed to excess nitrogen deposition and affected by eutrophication. In 2020, more than 50% of the ecosystem areas are expected to be at risk of eutrophication in the EU.   The 2020 thematic strategy objective will therefore not be met unless additional measures to mitigate nitrogen emissions are introduced, through further specific and targeted (technical) measures, particularly in the agriculture and transport sectors. Dietary changes resulting in lessmeat and dairy farming andthe reduced use of petrol and diesel in cars could also contribute to reductions.   Country level information   Figure 2 shows the percentage of the area by country where the critical loads for eutrophication were exceeded in 2010 and the areas where exceedance is expected in 2020. Although a decrease is predicted by 2020, if current legislation is implemented, the area showing exceedance will be above 50% in most countries (see bars). Extremely high magnitudes of exceedance can be found in Denmark, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland, caused by high deposition rates and/or ecosystems that are very sensitive to an excess supply of nitrogen from the atmosphere (see dots), for example nutrient-poor grasslands.     Figure 2.  The ecosystem area at risk of eutrophication and the magnitude of exceedance in each country          Note: AAE is the average accumulated exceedance, showing the magnitude of exceedance in equivalents (mol nitrogen/ha per year). The data are based on the revised Gothenburg Protocol emission reduction agreements of 2012 (assuming for the 2020 scenario that current legislation is fully implemented). Data for Serbia and Montenegro are presented as aggregated data.      Outlook beyond 2020   The updated air pollution strategy proposed by the European Commission in late 2013 aims to achieve a situation in which the EU ecosystem area exceeding critical loads for eutrophication is reduced by 35% by 2030, relative to 2005 ( EC, 2013 ). This target would not be met if only current legislation was fully implemented. In the EU, the area at risk of eutrophication is projected to decrease only slightly by 2030. The 35% reduction target would be met in 2030 if the maximum number of technically feasible reduction measures was implemented ( EEA, 2015 ).   As part of the air pollution strategy package, the European Commission has put forward a revised National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive. This proposes more ambitious national commitments to reduce emissions, compared with the current Directive ( EC, 2001 ), for the two eutrophying air pollutants, NO x  and NH 3 , among other things. These new ceilings will be applicable from 2020 and 2030 and will contribute to the achievement of the objective of 35% by 2030.   Beyond 2030, a time horizon of 2050 has been proposed as an aspirational year in which to achieve Europes long-term objectives, i.e. that air pollution does not lead to unacceptable harm to human health and the environment.   About the indicator   The indicator shows area and quantitative information for ecosystems where atmospheric nutrient nitrogen deposition is above the criticalload. A critical load is a quantitative estimate of an exposure to one or more pollutants, below which significant harmful effects on specified sensitive elements of the environment do not occur according to present knowledge (  UNECE, 2015  ).Deposition loads of eutrophying airborne pollutants above the critical loads are termed an 'exceedance'.   Exposure in an ecosystem for which information on critical loads is available, is calculated as the average accumulated exceedance (AAE).

However information on the 'decisive progress' of these policies towards reducing vulnerability and enhancing resilience to climate change is limited, preventing firm conclusions with respect to the 2020 outlook             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016      Setting the Scene   The 7th EAP calls for decisive progress to be made in adapting to climate change to make Europe more climate resilient (EU, 2013). Climate change impacts can be seen in global sea level rise, changes in precipitation (e.g. increases in northern and north-western Europe and decreases in southern Europe), decreasing snow cover, glaciers, sea ice and ice sheets. These changes lead to a wide range of often adverse impacts on environmental systems, economic sectors, and human health and well-being in Europe (EEA, 2012 and 2016; IPCC, 2014). Climate change adaptation addresses the adverse effects of climate change and builds resilience to reduce vulnerabilities and risks to the environment, human health and the economy (including infrastructure).   Policy targets and progress   The European Commissions White Paper (EC, 2009) and EU strategy on adaptation to climate change (EC, 2013) encourage all Member States to adopt comprehensive adaptation strategies. The strategy promotes action in cities and the mainstreaming of adaptation in relevant EU policies and programmes. In addition, it provides funding for actions, enhances research under the Horizon 2020 programme for environment and climate action, and promotes information sharing through the European Climate Adaptation Platform. In 2017, the European Commission will assess whether or not the action being taken in the Member States is sufficient. If it deems progress to be insufficient, by reference to the coverage and quality of the national strategies, the Commission will consider proposing a legally binding instrument (EC, 2013). That 2017 report will include an adaptation preparedness scoreboard, with key process-based indicators for measuring Member States levels of readiness.   NASs usually address overarching issues that allow them to position adaptation on the policy agenda. These strategies recognise the importance of expected climate change impacts and the need to adapt, and they facilitate the process of coordinating the adaptation response, increasing awareness of adaptation and stakeholder involvement, assessing risks and vulnerabilities, and identifying knowledge gaps.   NAPs usually aim to implement NASs and to organise activities for achieving their objectives, typically through sectoral implementation. Although adaptation implementation at national level is still at an early stage, adaptation planning work is under way in most countries.    Country level information    Table 1 provides an overview of progress with the adoption of national and sectoral climate change adaptation strategies and plans by EEA member countries. To date, 20 EU Member States and three other EEA member countries have adopted NASs. In addition, nine EU Member States and three other EEA member countries have developed NAPs. Table 1 shows that over the last 5 years there has been a steady increase in the number of NASs and NAPs being adopted by EU Member States and other EEA member countries, and this is expected to continue towards 2020, with additional countries adopting strategies and plans as well as implementing more specific adaptation policies and actions in line with their strategies and plans.      Table 1.  Overview of national and sectoral climate change adaptation strategies and plans, by country             Source: EEA, 2014, information reported by EU Member States under the European mechanism for monitoring and reporting information relevant to climate change (Regulation (EU) No 525/2013) and for other EEA Member countries information provided on a voluntary basis to the EEA as of May 2016.    Regarding the implementing of adaptation policies and actions, most progress has been reported for freshwater management, flood risk management, agriculture and forestry. The adaptation actions in these sectors have mostly consisted of mainstreaming adaptation priorities into these national sectoral policy areas. Several countries have also developed national health strategies and action plans, including early warning systems for heatwaves and enhanced surveillance of infectious diseases (EEA, 2014).   A limited number of countries have started to monitor and report on adaptation policies and actions at national level (EEA, 2014). So far, even fewer countries evaluate adaptation policies at national level; there are various reasons, including the fact that implementation of adaptation has only just begun (EEA, 2015). The countries that monitor these use mainly process-based methods, assessing to what extent agreed stages in the process of taking actions have taken place. Very few countries use outcome-based approaches, assessing if and how vulnerability has decreased and/or resilience has increased, because this is methodologically very complex and also resource intensive. It will therefore not be possible to determine with any certainty whether or not decisive progress in adapting to the impact of climate change can be achieved by 2020.   Transnational cooperation in adaptation to climate change has increased with the recognition of the importance of adaptation as a cross-cutting policy area. Adaptation actions take place, for example, within the EU Baltic Sea region strategy, the Danube Commission and the Carpathian and Alpine conventions. Adaptation action is often linked to the sharing of natural resources such as transboundary water catchments (EEA, 2016).   Adaptation policy will receive new EU financial resources in the coming years. Of the EU budget for 20142020, 20% will be used for climate-related actions (i.e. adaptation and climate change mitigation).   Outlook beyond 2020   Because of expected future climate change impacts, efforts to adapt to climate change and to make Europe more climate resilient need to be strengthened in future. NASs and NAPs, together with the EUs 2013 adaptation strategy, are expected to be further implemented, and mainstreaming of climate change adaptation in policies is expected to continue. Key global agreements that can also enhance action on adaptation in Europe include the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2015), which requires countries to take adaptation action, complementary to climate change mitigation action, and the 2015 UN Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR, 2015), which acknowledges climate change as one of the drivers of disaster risk and requires countries to take risk prevention and reduction measures.     About the indicator   This indicator shows the number of Member States that have adopted an adaptation strategy and/or plan and indicates how many countries have made progress on adapting to climate change by setting this issue on the policy agenda (through strategies). Many of these action plans have been in place for only a few years (see Table 1), so implementation has started rather recently. There is limited quantitative information available, and in only a few countries, on the effectiveness of adaptation strategies and plans regarding enhanced resilience and reduced vulnerabilities and risks. This indicator is therefore not yet able to show the effectiveness of these strategies and plans in making Europe more climate resilient. More information on this is expected to become available in future when more countries implement monitoring, reporting and evaluation adaptation schemes.,    Indicator   EU indicator past trend    Selected objective to be met by2020   Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020      Number of countries that have adopted a climate change adaptation strategy and/or plan   N.A.(1)   Make decisive progress in adapting to the impact of climate change  7th EAP        There has been an increase in the number of countries that have adopted a national adaptation strategy and/or plan and this is expected to continue. However information on the 'decisive progress' of these policies towards reducing vulnerability and enhancing resilience to climate change is limited, preventing firm conclusions with respect to the 2020 outlook     For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the EEA Environmental indicator report 2016 Setting the Scene The 7th EAP calls for decisive progress to be made in adapting to climate change to make Europe more climate resilient (EU, 2013). Climate change impacts can be seen in global sea level rise, changes in precipitation (e.g. increases in northern and north-western Europe and decreases in southern Europe), decreasing snow cover, glaciers, sea ice and ice sheets. These changes lead to a wide range of often adverse impacts on environmental systems, economic sectors, and human health and well-being in Europe (EEA, 2012 and 2016; IPCC, 2014). Climate change adaptation addresses the adverse effects of climate change and builds resilience to reduce vulnerabilities and risks to the environment, human health and the economy (including infrastructure). Policy targets and progress The European Commissions White Paper (EC, 2009) and EU strategy on adaptation to climate change (EC, 2013) encourage all Member States to adopt comprehensive adaptation strategies. The strategy promotes action in cities and the mainstreaming of adaptation in relevant EU policies and programmes. In addition, it provides funding for actions, enhances research under the Horizon 2020 programme for environment and climate action, and promotes information sharing through the European Climate Adaptation Platform. In 2017, the European Commission will assess whether or not the action being taken in the Member States is sufficient. If it deems progress to be insufficient, by reference to the coverage and quality of the national strategies, the Commission will consider proposing a legally binding instrument (EC, 2013). That 2017 report will include an adaptation preparedness scoreboard, with key process-based indicators for measuring Member States levels of readiness. NASs usually address overarching issues that allow them to position adaptation on the policy agenda. These strategies recognise the importance of expected climate change impacts and the need to adapt, and they facilitate the process of coordinating the adaptation response, increasing awareness of adaptation and stakeholder involvement, assessing risks and vulnerabilities, and identifying knowledge gaps. NAPs usually aim to implement NASs and to organise activities for achieving their objectives, typically through sectoral implementation. Although adaptation implementation at national level is still at an early stage, adaptation planning work is under way in most countries. Country level information Table 1 provides an overview of progress with the adoption of national and sectoral climate change adaptation strategies and plans by EEA member countries. To date, 20 EU Member States and three other EEA member countries have adopted NASs. In addition, nine EU Member States and three other EEA member countries have developed NAPs. Table 1 shows that over the last 5 years there has been a steady increase in the number of NASs and NAPs being adopted by EU Member States and other EEA member countries, and this is expected to continue towards 2020, with additional countries adopting strategies and plans as well as implementing more specific adaptation policies and actions in line with their strategies and plans.  Table 1.Overview of national and sectoral climate change adaptation strategies and plans, by country   Source:EEA, 2014, information reported by EU Member States under the European mechanism for monitoring and reporting information relevant to climate change (Regulation (EU) No 525/2013) and for other EEA Member countries information provided on a voluntary basis to the EEA as of May 2016. Regarding the implementing of adaptation policies and actions, most progress has been reported for freshwater management, flood risk management, agriculture and forestry. The adaptation actions in these sectors have mostly consisted of mainstreaming adaptation priorities into these national sectoral policy areas. Several countries have also developed national health strategies and action plans, including early warning systems for heatwaves and enhanced surveillance of infectious diseases (EEA, 2014). A limited number of countries have started to monitor and report on adaptation policies and actions at national level (EEA, 2014). So far, even fewer countries evaluate adaptation policies at national level; there are various reasons, including the fact that implementation of adaptation has only just begun (EEA, 2015). The countries that monitor these use mainly process-based methods, assessing to what extent agreed stages in the process of taking actions have taken place. Very few countries use outcome-based approaches, assessing if and how vulnerability has decreased and/or resilience has increased, because this is methodologically very complex and also resource intensive. It will therefore not be possible to determine with any certainty whether or not decisive progress in adapting to the impact of climate change can be achieved by 2020. Transnational cooperation in adaptation to climate change has increased with the recognition of the importance of adaptation as a cross-cutting policy area. Adaptation actions take place, for example, within the EU Baltic Sea region strategy, the Danube Commission and the Carpathian and Alpine conventions. Adaptation action is often linked to the sharing of natural resources such as transboundary water catchments (EEA, 2016). Adaptation policy will receive new EU financial resources in the coming years. Of the EU budget for 20142020, 20% will be used for climate-related actions (i.e. adaptation and climate change mitigation). Outlook beyond 2020 Because of expected future climate change impacts, efforts to adapt to climate change and to make Europe more climate resilient need to be strengthened in future. NASs and NAPs, together with the EUs 2013 adaptation strategy, are expected to be further implemented, and mainstreaming of climate change adaptation in policies is expected to continue. Key global agreements that can also enhance action on adaptation in Europe include the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2015), which requires countries to take adaptation action, complementary to climate change mitigation action, and the 2015 UN Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR, 2015), which acknowledges climate change as one of the drivers of disaster risk and requires countries to take risk prevention and reduction measures. About the indicator This indicator shows the number of Member States that have adopted an adaptation strategy and/or plan and indicates how many countries have made progress on adapting to climate change by setting this issue on the policy agenda (through strategies). Many of these action plans have been in place for only a few years (see Table 1), so implementation has started rather recently. There is limited quantitative information available, and in only a few countries, on the effectiveness of adaptation strategies and plans regarding enhanced resilience and reduced vulnerabilities and risks. This indicator is therefore not yet able to show the effectiveness of these strategies and plans in making Europe more climate resilient. More information on this is expected to become available in future when more countries implement monitoring, reporting and evaluation adaptation schemes."

If the current pace of growth is maintained, the 2020 renewable energy target will be met             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016      Setting the scene   The 7th EAP supports the EUs objective of meeting its 2020 renewable energy target, as stipulated in the Renewable Energy Directive (EU, 2013). In comparison with fossil fuels, using renewable energy results in reduced greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions, reduced environmental and health impacts, and a reduced dependency on energy imports.   Policy targets and progress   The Renewable Energy Directive (EU, 2009) commits the EU to reaching 20% of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by 2020. It sets binding national targets for renewable energy consumption in 2020 and it prescribes for each Member State minimum indicative trajectories in the run-up to 2020 to ensure that national targets will be met.   The Directive also requires Member States to adopt national renewable energy action plans that outline expected trajectories for the national share of renewable energy sources (RES) from 2010 to 2020. It also requires Member States to report every 2 years on progress towards the indicative trajectories of the Directive as well as towards the trajectories that they have set themselves in their action plans.   Figure 1. Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption, EU-28        Note:    Share results 2014       As can be seen in Figure 1, the proportion of renewable energy increased continuously between 2005 and 2014, with an annual compound growth rate of 7%, to reach 15% in 2013 and 16% in 2014 (EEA, 2015a). This has put the EU well on the path to meeting its target. The increase has been more rapid than the target path. The increase was mainly the result of various support schemes that were put in place by Member States, such as feed-in tariffs, feed-in premiums, auction/tender systems, quotas, tax credits and grants.   Shrinking production costs due to the scaling up of global production volumes and technological advances have also played an important role (EC, 2015). Photovoltaics (technologies that transform solar energy to electricity) have experienced the largest reduction in costs, with costs per kilowatt hour decreasing by 53% between 2010 and 2014 (UNEP, 2014). Electricity from onshore wind turbines became 15% cheaper during the same period (UNEP, 2014). Lower final energy consumption has also helped the EU to increase its renewable energy share (see EEA, 2016, and the EEAs final energy consumption indicator, CSI027) because, if final energy consumption is lower, a lower overall quantity of energy is required from renewables to meet the target.   If Member States fully deliver on their national renewable energy action plans, the EU will slightly over-achieve its target (by about 1percentage point) (EEA, 2015b). Wind power, solar electricity and biofuels for transport are expected to have the highest growth rates to 2020 (UNEP, 2014). This was also the case during the 20052014 period, in particular with respect to wind and solar electricity. In absolute terms, however, hydropower and biomass (for heat generation) will remain the most important single RES, despite a decrease in their contribution to the overall energy produced by renewable sources. In 2012, hydropower accounted for 17%, and biomass and waste for 64%, of final renewable energy consumption.    While EU countries still lead the world in total installed renewable capacity, the EU is losing ground to China, Japan and the United States with respect to new installations (EEA, 2016). The EU was the region with the highest RES investments every single year from 2005 to 2012, surpassed by China only in 2013 (UNEP, 2014); this shows that the EU played a leading role in the development of renewables in their early stage, and for the global roll-out of RES. Of world regions with sufficient data availability, the EU came third in per capita employment in the area of renewable energy in 2014 (EEA, 2016). However, in 2013, EU investment in renewables slumped by 44% compared with the previous year. This reflected not only lower costs but also uncertainty about the future of support mechanisms and lower investment capacity due to the persistent economic downturn in some EU countries (UNEP, 2014). Feed-in tariffs, an effective renewable energy support scheme, were drastically cut in 2012 and 2013 in some Member States. In some cases these changes were applied retroactively, i.e. to existing plants (EC, 2015). Policy uncertainty increases the costs of renewable energy installation and makes Europe a less attractive prospect for investors and renewable energy developers (UNEP, 2014). This has already been observed in the solar power industry. The strong growth in the renewable energy sector in Europe is picked up in the Environmental goods and services sector briefing ( AIRS_PO2.12 )  1   and the Environmental protection expenditure briefing ( AIRS_ PO2.13 ).  2    Given this context, further action from Member States may be required to ensure that the EU remains on the path to the 2020 target. A number of European governments have introduced measures such as premiums on spot market prices, competitive tenders or capacity-dependent feed-in tariffs to help protect and increase the market penetration of renewable energy operators (EC, 2015a). In 2014, the European Commission published guidelines on state aid for environmental protection and energy for the period up until 2020 (EC, 2014), which, inter alia, should contribute towards a more harmonised approach to supporting renewable energy growth across the EU.    Country level information     Figure 2. Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption           As can be seen in Figure 2, the contribution of RES to gross final energy consumption varies greatly between countries in Europe. This reflects different starting points in the deployment of renewables in each country and differences in the availability of natural resources to produce renewable energy. It also reflects, to some extent, differences in policies to stimulate renewables. Between 2004 and 2014, 12 EU countries at least doubled their renewable energy shares and Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Lithuania, Romania and Sweden have already reached their targets for 2020.    The countries that are the furthest from their targets are the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and France (EEA, 2015b). As they account for about one third of the EUs final energy consumption, their progress in the deployment of renewable energy will play an important role in the prospects of the EU meeting its overall target.    Outlook beyond 2020    Additional deployment of RES beyond 2020 is vital if the EU is to achieve its aim of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 80  95% by 2050 compared with 1990 levels  an aim that is key to the 7th EAPs long-term vision of low-carbon growth decoupled from resource use well before 2050. EU countries have already agreed on a new, EU-wide renewable energy target of at least 27% of gross final energy consumption by 2030. The continued effort to expand renewable energy in the EU will also be a key element of the Energy Union strategy (EC, 2015b), which aims to ensure secure, sustainable and affordable energy supply for all EU citizens. Challenges for further progress in renewable energy are the expansion of the grid infrastructure to include a growing share of often decentralised RES, the increase of flexibility options in the system to accommodate a growing share of intermittent renewable technologies (e.g. through the development of demand-side management and energy storage options), and the sustainable sourcing and use of biomass (including biofuels).   About the indicator   This indicator is defined as the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption. Gross final energy consumption is defined as energy commodities delivered for energy purposes to industry, transport, households, services including public services, agriculture, forestry and fisheries, including the consumption of electricity and heat by the energy branch for electricity and heat production and including losses of electricity and heat in distribution and transmission (EU, 2009). The indicator includes the contribution of renewable sources to all of the final uses of energy (electricity, transport, and heating and cooling). RES include wind, solar, aerothermal, geothermal, hydro, ocean energy sources, biomass and the biodegradable fraction of waste.,    Indicator   EU indicator past trend   Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020     Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption        Reach a 20% share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption - Renewable Energy Directive      The EU has steadily increased the share of renewable energy in its gross final energy consumption.

The EU is losing biodiversity. Biodiversity is not only important in its own right, it also provides society with a wide range of ecosystem services upon which we depend, such as food, freshwater, pollination etc. This briefing examines trends in populations of common farmland and forest birds, and grassland butterflies. These are considered by the scientific community to be excellent barometers of the overall biodiversity and of the health of ecosystems, as they occur in many habitats and are sensitive to environmental change. For aspects of legally protected biodiversity and habitats, see the briefings on EU protected species ( AIRS_PO1.7, 2016 ) 1  and habitats ( AIRS_PO1.8, 2016 ). 2    Policy targets and progress   Halting and reversing the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services by 2020 is the central aim of the EU Biodiversity Strategy (EC, 2011). This includes preserving common biodiversity such as commonbirds and grassland butterflies. This aligns with the 7th EAP objective of halting, by 2020, the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services.   Since 1990, common bird populations have decreased by around 15% in the EU; the decline of common farmland birds was more pronounced at34%, whereas common forest birds declined by13%. The trends remain very similar when Norway and Switzerland, two other EEA member countries for which data are available, are also included in the indicator coverage; for more information see the EEAindicator: abundance and distribution ofselected species(EEA, 2016).   Figure 1. Long term trends for common bird species in 23 EU countries*          Note: * 23 EU Member States = all EU Member States except Croatia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta and Romania.    The negative trend in farmland-related biodiversity is confirmed by the population index forgrassland butterflies in Figure 2 (species with a high sensitivity to habitat degradation and loss), for which a significant decline of 30% has been observed since 1990.        Figure 2. Long term trends for grassland butterflies in 14 EU countries         The long-term trends for common farmland birds and forest birds, as well as grassland butterflies, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, demonstrate that the EU has experienced a major decline in biodiversity associated with agro-ecosystems and grasslands (EEA, 2015). This was primarily due to habitat change  including loss, fragmentation and degradation  of natural and semi-natural habitats. The habitat change was mainly caused by homogenisation and loss of habitat as a result of agricultural intensification and land abandonment, intensely managed forests and some loss of habitats to urbanisation (EEA, 2015).   This negative trend shows no sign of changing, despite progress in enacting and implementing European policies (such the Birds and Habitats Directives (EU, 1992 and 2009) and the Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000)), as well as the environmental measures within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Unfortunately, to date the CAP has not influenced agricultural practices enough to reduce overall loss of biodiversity. The outcomes of the latest Habitats Directive reporting round demonstrate the lack of any substantial progress in the conservation status of grasslands. The vast majority of assessments of the conservation status of agricultural habitats, as well as of woodland and other forest habitats, remain unfavourable (over 86 % and 80 %, respectively).   The environment-related elements set out in the EU reform package, in particular for EU agriculture and cohesion policies, backed by the initiatives for greening the EU budget under the Multi-Annual Financial Framework 20142020, are designed to support those objectives. Greening of the CAP aims to promote environmentally beneficial agricultural and forestry practices such as crop diversification, the protection of permanent grassland and grazing land, and sustainable agroforestry. Rural Development Programmes 20142020 address restoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems through payments to cover the cost of farmers adopting environment- and climate-friendly land management practices.   The mid-term review of the EU Biodiversity Strategy comprehensively assessed progress towards the headline target (and towards all six targets) and concluded that the EU is not on track to meet the objective of halting biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecosystem services by 2020 (EC, 2015). The continuing declining trends apparent for regularly monitored groups, such as grassland butterflies and farmland birds, despite environmental measures implemented so far, illustrate well that it is highly unlikely that the objective will be achieved by 2020.   Outlook beyond 2020   It is difficult to forecast how soon biodiversity, as illustrated by the abundance of bird and grassland butterfly populations, will recover, as their state is influenced by a complex combination of environmental factors and policy measures.Substantialpositive impacts of the CAP reform and the measures anticipated under the Multi-Annual Financial Framework 20142020 on common species associated with farmland might become visible in the 20202030 period, as long as these policies are implemented thoroughly and on a large scale throughout the EU.On the other hand, other factors that could adversely impact the outlook beyond 2020 include the negative impact of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystems, particularly on these specialist species groups that are dependent on non-intensive agriculture and forest ecosystems. The increased competition for land could also intensify agricultural production in the EU, through land take via urbanisation ( AIRS_PO1.3, 2016 ) 3 , as well as for the production of renewable energy and biofuels ( AIRS_PO2.6, 2016 ) 4 .   About the indicator   This indicator shows trends in the abundance of common birds and grassland butterflies over time across their European distribution. It is an index indicator (relative values, 1990 set to 100). Birds and butterflies are excellent barometers of the overall health of ecosystems, mainly because they occur in many habitats and are sensitive to environmental change. The data collection methods are scientifically sound, and birds and butterflies are familiar groups of species well known to the public. Common birds are monitored in 25 European countries (23 EUMember States(all EU-28,except Croatia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta and Romania) plus Norway and Switzerland). Butterfly monitoring has a more limited geographical coverage, with data available from 14 EU countries (Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom).,    Indicator   Indicator past trend   Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlookof the EU meetingthe selectedobjective by 2020     Abundance and distribution of selected species (common birds and grassland butterflies)   EU  Birds   Butterflies    EEA   Birds       Meet the headline target of the EU Biodiversity Strategy: to halt the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services         It is highly unlikely that the objective will be achieved by 2020 given the continuing declining trends apparent for certain groups, such as grassland butterflies and farmland birds     For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the EEA Environmental indicator report 2016  Setting the Scene The 7th EAP (EU, 2013) contains the objective of halting, by 2020, the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services, as well as restoring them as far as feasible.

These are considered by the scientific community to be excellent barometers of the overall biodiversity and of the health of ecosystems, as they occur in many habitats and are sensitive to environmental change. For aspects of legally protected biodiversity and habitats, see the briefings on EU protected species (AIRS_PO1.7, 2016)1 and habitats (AIRS_PO1.8, 2016).2 Policy targets and progress Halting and reversing the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services by 2020 is the central aim of the EU Biodiversity Strategy (EC, 2011). This includes preserving common biodiversity such as commonbirds and grassland butterflies. This aligns with the 7th EAP objective of halting, by 2020, the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services. Since 1990, common bird populations have decreased by around 15% in the EU; the decline of common farmland birds was more pronounced at34%, whereas common forest birds declined by13%. The trends remain very similar when Norway and Switzerland, two other EEA member countries for which data are available, are also included in the indicator coverage; for more information see the EEAindicator: abundance and distribution ofselected species(EEA, 2016). Figure 1. Long term trends for common bird speciesin 23 EU countries*  Note: * 23 EU Member States = all EU Member States except Croatia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta and Romania. The negative trend in farmland-related biodiversity is confirmed by the population index forgrassland butterflies in Figure 2 (species with a high sensitivity to habitat degradation and loss), for which a significant decline of 30% has been observed since 1990.   Figure 2. Long term trends for grassland butterflies in 14 EU countries  The long-term trends for common farmland birds and forest birds, as well as grassland butterflies, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, demonstrate that the EU has experienced a major decline in biodiversity associated with agro-ecosystems and grasslands (EEA, 2015). This was primarily due to habitat change  including loss, fragmentation and degradation  of natural and semi-natural habitats. The habitat change was mainly caused by homogenisation and loss of habitat as a result of agricultural intensification and land abandonment, intensely managed forests and some loss of habitats to urbanisation (EEA, 2015). This negative trend shows no sign of changing, despite progress in enacting and implementing European policies (such the Birds and Habitats Directives (EU, 1992 and 2009) and the Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000)), as well as the environmental measures within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Unfortunately, to date the CAP has not influenced agricultural practices enough to reduce overall loss of biodiversity. The outcomes of the latest Habitats Directive reporting round demonstrate the lack of any substantial progress in the conservation status of grasslands. The vast majority of assessments of the conservation status of agricultural habitats, as well as of woodland and other forest habitats, remain unfavourable (over 86 % and 80 %, respectively). The environment-related elements set out in the EU reform package, in particular for EU agriculture and cohesion policies, backed by the initiatives for greening the EU budget under the Multi-Annual Financial Framework 20142020, are designed to support those objectives. Greening of the CAP aims to promote environmentally beneficial agricultural and forestry practices such as crop diversification, the protection of permanent grassland and grazing land, and sustainable agroforestry. Rural Development Programmes 20142020 address restoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems through payments to cover the cost of farmers adopting environment- and climate-friendly land management practices. The mid-term review of the EU Biodiversity Strategy comprehensively assessed progress towards the headline target (and towards all six targets) and concluded that the EU is not on track to meet the objective of halting biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecosystem services by 2020 (EC, 2015). The continuing declining trends apparent for regularly monitored groups, such as grassland butterflies and farmland birds, despite environmental measures implemented so far, illustrate well that it is highly unlikely that the objective will be achieved by 2020. Outlook beyond 2020 It is difficult to forecast how soon biodiversity, as illustrated by the abundance of bird and grassland butterfly populations, will recover, as their state is influenced by a complex combination of environmental factors and policy measures.Substantialpositive impacts of the CAP reform and the measures anticipated under the Multi-Annual Financial Framework 20142020 on common species associated with farmland might become visible in the 20202030 period, as long as these policies are implemented thoroughly and on a large scale throughout the EU.On the other hand, other factors that could adversely impact the outlook beyond 2020 include the negative impact of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystems, particularly on these specialist species groups that are dependent on non-intensive agriculture and forest ecosystems. The increased competition for land could also intensify agricultural production in the EU, through land take via urbanisation (AIRS_PO1.3, 2016)3, as well as for the production of renewable energy and biofuels (AIRS_PO2.6, 2016)4. About the indicator This indicator shows trends in the abundance of common birds and grassland butterflies over time across their European distribution. It is an index indicator (relative values, 1990 set to 100). Birds and butterflies are excellent barometers of the overall health of ecosystems, mainly because they occur in many habitats and are sensitive to environmental change. The data collection methods are scientifically sound, and birds and butterflies are familiar groups of species well known to the public. Common birds are monitored in 25 European countries (23 EUMember States(all EU-28,except Croatia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta and Romania) plus Norway and Switzerland).Butterfly monitoring has a more limited geographical coverage, with data available from 14 EU countries (Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom)."

The waste hierarchy is the central framework for EU and national waste policies. This hierarchy gives the highest priority to policies and actions that promote waste prevention, followed by preparing for reuse, recycling, other recovery and finally disposal. This briefing presents trends in waste generation. Reducing the amount of waste generated means that there is less waste to manage and also potentially that the demand for material resources and associated environmental impacts has been reduced ( AIRS_PO2.1, 2016 ). 1     Policy targets and progress    The Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe includes the goal that, by 2020, waste generated per capita will be in absolutedecline (EC, 2011).Waste prevention and the use of waste as a resource is becoming increasingly important, not only in environmental policy but also in industrial and raw material policy. In December 2015, the European Commissionpublished Closing the loop  An EU action plan for thecircular economy (EC, 2015), otherwise known as the Circular Economy Package. Unlikethe traditional linear takemakeconsumedispose approach, a circular economy seeks to respectplanetary boundaries by increasing the proportion of renewable or recyclable resources while reducingthe consumption of raw materials.   Approaches such as eco-design and sharing, reuse, repair and refurbishing will play a significant role in maintaining the utility of products and components, and reducing the generation of waste (EEA, 2016).   The Waste Framework Directive (EU, 2008), obliges EU Member States to adopt and implement waste prevention programmes. A review of available programmes indicates that countries use a broad range of measures with a focus on information-based instruments. However, not all programmes include quantified waste prevention targets or economic instruments (EEA, 2015).    Figure 1. Generation of waste, excluding major mineral wastes,  EU            The total amount of waste in the EU, excluding major mineral wastes, reduced by 2% between 2004 and 2012 (Figure 1). In 2012, the highest levels of waste generation were recorded for households, the water and waste sector and the manufacturing sector.   Trends in individual sectors have been mixed. Between 2004 and 2012, there was a reduction in the waste generated by agriculture, forestry and fishing (37%), manufacturing (26%), and services (19%). Household waste generation declined by a more modest 5% over the same period.   Waste generated by the water and waste sector and the construction industry grew at a rapid pace: by 61% and 45%, respectively, despite a dip in construction waste output in 2008 that corresponded with the economic downturn. However, waste generated by the waste sector includes secondary waste so it is likely that an increase in recycling activities has contributed to this increase,becausesome material that is collected for recyclingcannot be recovered and has to re-join the waste stream. This effect cannot currently be quantified because of a lack of data.   Figure 2 presents indices for the waste generated by the two main production sectors of the European economy (manufacturing and services), for the EU-28 plus Norway, and by household consumption for the EEA-33 (EU-28, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey). Household waste comprises the bulk of municipal waste. The figure also shows a measure of the economic output of services and manufacturing(the gross value added)and a measure of consumption (household expenditure).   Figure 2. Waste generation by production and consumption activities        Some economic production and consumption activities in Europe are becoming less waste intensive, even if allowance is made for the 2008 economic downturn. Figure 2 shows that waste generation from manufacturing declined by 25% in absolute terms between 2004 and 2012, despite an increase of 7% in sectoral economic output. Waste generation from the service sector also declined by 23% in the same period, despite an increase of 13% in sectoral economic output.   Turning to consumption, total municipal waste generation in the EEA-33 declined by 2% between 2004 and 2012, despite a 7% increase in real household expenditure. Per capita generation of municipal waste (EEA-33), which mostly originates from households, declined by 5% in the same period, falling from 511 to 485kg per capita.   The overall improvements are most likely due to a combination of various factors: efficiency improvements in production processes and management, changes in the structure of the manufacturing sector, an increase in activity in the services sector and a shift towards less intensive waste-generating activities. However, some of the trends might be influenced by data quality issues. For example, the distinction between waste and by-products has a significant impact on the amounts of waste generated in agriculture, forestry and fishing; and in manufacturing (EC, 2014).   The services sector is an order of magnitude less waste intensive than the manufacturing sector: 0.014kg/EUR in 2012 for services and 0.12kg/EUR in 2012 for manufacturing. An economic restructuring towards more service industries can therefore be a key driver towards reduced waste generation.   The structure of production in Europe is changing. Trade liberalisation combined with lower labour costs and less regulation in many developing countries has resulted in the movement of the production of goods consumed in Europe to other regions of the world. Some sectors, including the metals, telecommunications, electrical appliances, textiles, food and chemical sectors, have been particularly affected by relocation since 2000. Some parts of the services sector have also been affected. This development may have added to the decline in waste generation (EEA, 2014).   The overall amount of waste generated has remained fairly stable, with only a slight reduction between 2004 and 2012. While some sectors are becoming less waste intensive, the prospect that total waste generation will be in decline by 2020 is uncertain. Total waste generation began to rise again between 2010 and 2012 as economies recovered. However, theCircular Economy Package and the waste prevention programmes in the EU Member States should contribute to a reduction in waste generation.      Country level information    Figure 3. Waste (excluding mineral and solidified) generation by country, 2004 and 2012 (kg/capita)         Figure 3 shows that the majority of European countries generate between 1 and 2 tonnes of waste (excluding mineral waste) per person per year. That figure is declining in most countries; however, increases in some countries may be due to changes in data collection methods. This is the case in Belgium (EC, 2014), and the high figures for Estonia are believed to relate to the inclusion of waste from the oil shale industry, which is included as mineral wastes in other countries (Eurostat, 2014).    Outlook beyond 2020    The long-term prospects for reducing the waste generated by production activities appear positive, although some of these gains could be associated with the movement of manufacturing industries out of Europe. A shift to a circular economy, with increased reuse of goods and materials, will reduce both consumption- andproduction-based waste generation. The Circular Economy Package (EC, 2015) includes a number of measures that aim to reduce waste generation beyond 2020. These include concrete measures to promote reuse and stimulate industrial symbiosis  turning one industrys by-product into another industrys raw material  and economic incentives for producers to put greener products on the market and support recovery and recycling schemes (e.g. for packaging, batteries, electric and electronic equipment, vehicles). The success of these measures will be key to the medium- to long-term prospects for reducing waste generation.   About the indicator   This indicator is defined as the weight of waste generated by an economy per year, excluding mineral wastes, dredging spoils and contaminated soils. This exclusion enhances comparability across countries, as mineral waste accounts for very high quantities in some countries and for some economic activities, such as mining and construction. If this category were included, it would account for 71% of the total waste generated in the EU in 2012.   Waste generation data are published by Eurostat every 2 years for seven broad economic sectors: agriculture, forestry and fishing; energy and extraction; water and waste; manufacturing; construction; services; and households.   The water and waste sector includes water collection, treatment and supply, sewerage and three waste sector categories (waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery, remediation activities and other waste management services; and wholesale of waste and scrap). The three waste sectors include secondary waste, i.e. material that has originated from other sectors.   The energy and extraction sector includes electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply plus non-mineral wastes from mining and quarrying. Manufacturing includes foods, textiles, wood, paper, coke, chemicals, metals, electronics, transport equipment and other machinery.,    Indicator   Indicator past trend      Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020     Waste generation in Europe   EU     EEA    Manage waste safely as a resource.

It also harms crop growth and ecosystems, and damages the built environment (EEA, 2016a). In Europe, the most problematic pollutants in terms of harm to human health are particulate matter (PM), ground-level ozone (O 3 ) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). PM is emitted directly from emission sources but also can form in the atmosphere from various precursor pollutants including sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and ammonia (NH 3 ). Ground-level O 3  is similarly formed in the atmosphere from various precursor species including NO x  and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). Each of these pollutants can contribute to premature mortality and morbidity including respiratory illness and cardiovascular disease. SO 2 , NO x  and NH 3  also cause ecosystem acidification and eutrophication, as well as damage to buildings and vegetation. When absorbed by plants, O 3  damages plant cells, impairing their ability to grow and reproduce, and leading to reduced agricultural crop yields, decreased forest growth and reduced biodiversity. The 7th EAP (EU, 2013) sets out commitments to improve the implementation of existing legislation and to secure additional reductions in air pollution. Air quality state and impacts are discussed in the briefing on outdoor air quality in urban areas ( AIRS_PO3.1, 2016 )(2) and the Eutrophication of terrestrial ecosystems to due to air pollution briefing ( AIRS_PO1.1, 2016 )(3)    Policy targets and progress    The NECD (EU, 2001) and the Gothenburg Protocol (UNECE, 1979) set emission ceilings for 2010 for European countries for SO x  (SO 2 in the NECD), NO x , NMVOCs and NH 3 . The 2012 amended Gothenburg Protocol (UNECE, 2012) also sets 2020 emission reduction commitments for these same four pollutants, as well as for PM 2.5 .   Anthropogenic emissions of certain air pollutants have decreased in both the EU-28 (Figure 1, left panel)and the EEA-33 (the 33 member countries of the European Environment Agency, which includes the 28 EU Member States)between 2005 and 2014 (Figure 1, right panel). However, for both NH 3  and PM 2.5 , little progress has been made in reducing emissions.   A number of Member States have reported emissions above the levels of their 2010 emission ceilings set out in the NECD, and some significantly so (by 10% or more) (EEA, 2016b):     NO x : 12 Member States exceeded their ceilings in 2010 and six Member States continued to exceed their emission ceilings in 2014 (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland and Luxembourg).   NMVOCs: five Member States exceeded their ceilings in 2010 and three Member States exceeded ceilings in 2014 (Denmark, Germany and Ireland).   SO 2 : all Member States met emission ceilings for SO 2  in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.   NH 3 : six Member States (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain) exceeded their ceilings in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.     Future reductions in emissions are still required in most Member States in order for them to meet their respective emission reduction commitments for 2020, as set out in the amended Gothenburg Protocol (UNECE, 2012).   Figure 1. Trends in emissions of air pollutants in the EU-28 (left) and in the EEA-33 (right), 20052014         Source:  National emissions reported to the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention), EEA, 2016c     In the paragraphs below, the trends in emissionsof the individual pollutants over the 2005 to 2014 period are discussed.   Nitrogen oxides   NO x emissions for the EEA-33 and the EU-28 continue to decrease and are more than 25% below 2005 levels. Emission reductions have, however, not been as great as originally anticipated. This is because real-world driving emissions in the road transport sector  especially for diesel passenger vehicles and vans  are, on average, four or five times higher than the European emission standards by vehicle type that all vehicles must meet in a laboratory testing procedure. The transport sector presently contributes 46% of total EU NO x emissions (47% in the EEA 33; EEA, 2016a).   Sulphur oxides   In 2014, SO x emissions had fallen to approximately 40% of their 2005 levels for the EU-28 and 54% of their 2005 levels for the EEA-33. The energy production anddistribution sectorhas been responsible for the largest reductions in emissions. This has happened for various reasons, including the closure of a number of old or uneconomical large combustion plants, which typically burn coal, and improvements in energy efficiency at industrial facilities, which have also reduced emissions.   Non-methane volatile organic compounds    NMVOC emissions for the EEA-33 and the EU-28 have fallen by approximately 24% and 27% compared with their 2005 levels, and nearly all countries have reported emissions below their 2010 emission ceilings. The largest source of NMVOC emissions is solvent and product use. Various EU measures have helped to reduce emissions over the past two decades, including stricter requirements for industrial facilities, limits on the solvent content of paints and mandatory vapour recovery equipment at petrol stations.   Ammonia    NH 3 emissions have remained largely stable since 2005 compared with the other pollutants. They fell by only 4% from their 2005 level in the EU-28, while in the EEA-33 NH 3 emissions have actually increased by almost 10% since 2005. Agriculture dominates emissions of NH 3 : they arise primarily from the decomposition of animal manure and fertiliser application. There are a number of available technical measures to mitigate ammonia emissions, yet little progress in reducing them is evident in the agricultural sector.   Particulate matter   Emissions of primary PM 2.5  (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5m or less) have reduced by almost 20%for both the EEA-33 and the EU-28 compared with their 2005 levels. Most PM 2.5 emissions come from small combustion plants at commercial and institutional facilities, as well as from households. Although the recently agreed Medium Combustion Plants Directive (EU, 2015) will help reduce future emissions of PM 2.5 from many facilities, it remains challenging for many authorities to regulate and reduce emissions from residential combustion. The latter is an important source of air pollution in many Member States. Road transport is the second most important source of PM 2.5 .   Based on this assessment of the progress made in reducing emissions of the individual pollutants, current projections suggest that the EU is on target to meet the 2020 Gothenburg Protocol emission reduction commitment (albeit with some uncertainty with respect to PM 2.5 ) (IIASAA, 2014).     Country-level information     Table 1 shows both the 2014 emissions and the Gothenburg Protocol emission reduction commitments for 2020. The colours indicate to what extent the 2014 emissions exceed the 2020 emission reduction commitment for each Member State and the EU as a whole.      Table 1. 2020 Gothenburg Protocol emission reduction commitments and 2014 emissions of air pollutants by Member States        Source: based on EEA (2016d).    As noted earlier, future reductions in emissions will still be required in most Member States so that they meet their respective emission reduction commitments for 2020, set out in the Gothenburg Protocol. However, a number of Member States already report emissions below the level required by 2020.   Outlook beyond 2020   As part of the Clean Air Policy Programme for Europe (EC, 2013), the European Commission has proposed a revised NECD, which proposes national emission reduction commitments for 2020 in line with those already agreed under the amended 2012 Gothenburg Protocol and new emission reduction commitments for 2030 and beyond. The 2030 commitments would apply to the pollutants currently covered (NO x , NMVOCs, SO 2 , and NH 3 ) and would add PM 2.5 . In the absence of new commitments to reduce emissions, only slow progress in further reducing emissions beyond 2030 is anticipated. The European Commissions proposal would deliver, by 2030, an estimated 52% reduction in premature mortality compared with the current emissions baseline (2005). Additional measures beyond the NECD proposal are still needed if Europe is to achieve the long-term objective of air pollution levels that do not lead to unacceptable harm to human health and the environment.    About the indicator    This indicator deals with the emissions of keyanthropogenicair pollutants.It covers anthropogenic emissions of the air pollutants SO x , NO x , NH 3 , NMVOCs, and PM 2.5  for the years 2005 to 2014.

It also harms crop growth and ecosystems, and damages the built environment (EEA, 2016a). In Europe, the most problematic pollutants in terms of harm to human health are particulate matter (PM), ground-level ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). PM is emitted directly from emission sources but also can form in the atmosphere from various precursor pollutants including sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ammonia (NH3). Ground-level O3 is similarly formed in the atmosphere from various precursor species including NOx and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). Each of these pollutants can contribute to premature mortality and morbidity including respiratory illness and cardiovascular disease. SO2, NOx and NH3 also cause ecosystem acidification and eutrophication, as well as damage to buildings and vegetation. When absorbed by plants, O3 damages plant cells, impairing their ability to grow and reproduce, and leading to reduced agricultural crop yields, decreased forest growth and reduced biodiversity. The 7th EAP (EU, 2013) sets out commitments to improve the implementation of existing legislation and to secure additional reductions in air pollution. Air quality state and impacts are discussed in the briefing on outdoor air quality in urban areas (AIRS_PO3.1, 2016)(2) and the Eutrophication of terrestrial ecosystems to due to air pollution briefing (AIRS_PO1.1, 2016)(3) Policy targets and progress The NECD (EU, 2001) and the Gothenburg Protocol (UNECE, 1979) set emission ceilings for 2010 for European countries for SOx (SO2in the NECD), NOx, NMVOCs and NH3. The 2012 amended Gothenburg Protocol (UNECE, 2012) also sets 2020 emission reduction commitments for these same four pollutants, as well as for PM2.5. Anthropogenic emissions of certain air pollutants have decreased in both the EU-28 (Figure 1, left panel)and the EEA-33 (the 33 member countries of the European Environment Agency, which includes the 28 EU Member States)between 2005 and 2014 (Figure 1, right panel). However, for both NH3 and PM2.5, little progress has been made in reducing emissions. A number of Member States have reported emissions above the levels of their 2010 emission ceilings set out in the NECD, and some significantly so (by 10% or more) (EEA, 2016b):  NOx: 12 Member States exceeded their ceilings in 2010 and six Member States continued to exceed their emission ceilings in 2014 (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland and Luxembourg). NMVOCs: five Member States exceeded their ceilings in 2010 and three Member States exceeded ceilings in 2014 (Denmark, Germany and Ireland). SO2: all Member States met emission ceilings for SO2 in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. NH3: six Member States (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain) exceeded their ceilings in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.  Future reductions in emissions are still required in most Member States in order for them to meet their respective emission reduction commitments for 2020, as set out in the amended Gothenburg Protocol (UNECE, 2012). Figure 1. Trends in emissions of air pollutants in the EU-28 (left) and in the EEA-33 (right), 20052014  Source: National emissions reported to the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention), EEA, 2016c  In the paragraphs below, the trends in emissionsof the individual pollutants over the 2005 to 2014 period are discussed. Nitrogen oxides NOxemissions for the EEA-33 and the EU-28 continue to decrease and are more than 25% below 2005 levels. Emission reductions have, however, not been as great as originally anticipated. This is because real-world driving emissions in the road transport sector  especially for diesel passenger vehicles and vans  are, on average, four or five times higher than the European emission standards by vehicle type that all vehicles must meet in a laboratory testing procedure. The transport sector presently contributes 46% of total EU NOxemissions (47% in the EEA 33; EEA, 2016a). Sulphur oxides In 2014, SOxemissions had fallen to approximately 40% of their 2005 levels for the EU-28 and 54% of their 2005 levels for the EEA-33. The energy production anddistribution sectorhas been responsible for the largest reductions in emissions. This has happened for various reasons, including the closure of a number of old or uneconomical large combustion plants, which typically burn coal, and improvements in energy efficiency at industrial facilities, which have also reduced emissions. Non-methane volatile organic compounds  NMVOC emissions for the EEA-33 and the EU-28 have fallen by approximately 24% and 27% compared with their 2005 levels, and nearly all countries have reported emissions below their 2010 emission ceilings. The largest source of NMVOC emissions is solvent and product use. Various EU measures have helped to reduce emissions over the past two decades, including stricter requirements for industrial facilities, limits on the solvent content of paints and mandatory vapour recovery equipment at petrol stations. Ammonia  NH3emissions have remained largely stable since 2005 compared with the other pollutants. They fell by only 4% from their 2005 level in the EU-28, while in the EEA-33 NH3emissions have actually increased by almost 10% since 2005. Agriculture dominates emissions of NH3: they arise primarily from the decomposition of animal manure and fertiliser application. There are a number of available technical measures to mitigate ammonia emissions, yet little progress in reducing them is evident in the agricultural sector. Particulate matter Emissions of primary PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5m or less) have reduced by almost 20%for both the EEA-33 and the EU-28 compared with their 2005 levels. Most PM2.5emissions come from small combustion plants at commercial and institutional facilities, as well as from households. Although the recently agreed Medium Combustion Plants Directive (EU, 2015) will help reduce future emissions of PM2.5from many facilities, it remains challenging for many authorities to regulate and reduce emissions from residential combustion. The latter is an important source of air pollution in many Member States. Road transport is the second most important source of PM2.5. Based on this assessment of the progress made in reducing emissions of the individual pollutants, current projections suggest that the EU is on target to meet the 2020 Gothenburg Protocol emission reduction commitment (albeit with some uncertainty with respect to PM2.5) (IIASAA, 2014).

This briefing presents trends in the shares of environmental and labour taxes in total tax revenues. The reasoning that it is more environmentally and economically sound to tax pollution and resource use than to tax labour is based on the theory that increased taxes on resources should incentivise a reduction in their use. Environmental taxation can allow fiscal consolidation while, at the same time, encouraging restructuring towards a resource-efficient economy (EC, 2011). Environmental tax reforms can change behaviour, redirecting consumption towards less taxed and less polluting commodities. Reducing taxation on labour and investment (for example income tax and corporation tax) can also encourage economic growth and, through targeted investment, can specifically encourage the creation of green jobs, for example in the recycling and energy efficiency sectors (EEA, 2013).      Policy targets and progress      The Roadmap for a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011) includes a milestone that, by 2020, a major shift of taxation from labour towards the environment will lead to a substantial increase in the share of environmental taxes that contribute to public revenues, in line with the best practice of Member States.       Figure 1.  Shares of environment and labour taxes in total tax revenues from taxes and social contributions, EU           For the EU as a whole, there has been no positive progress over the last decade (Figure 1). At the beginning of the 2000s, there was a slight increase in environmental taxes relative to labour taxes, but, since the economic downturn, this has not been sustained. The share of total revenues from taxes on labour has consistently remained at approximately eight times that of revenues from environmental taxes.   The years following the economic downturn offered the opportunity to use environmental fiscal reform to address rising unemployment. The lack of any positive movement at the EU level indicates that this opportunity has not been capitalised upon. This lack of progress comes in spite of renewed interest in environmental fiscal reform driven by various factors, including the push for fiscal consolidation and the growing recognition of the financial burden of certain measures, such as fossil fuel subsidies. The recent sharp fall in global oil prices is seen by some as providing an opportunity to launch carbon-pricing mechanisms and to reform fossil fuel subsidies (IEEP, 2015).   In addition to taxing energy and carbon, resource taxes offer opportunities to improve material resource efficiency ( see the Resource efficiency briefing (AIRS_PO2.1, 2016)  1 ). Such taxes are still largely unused in the EU, comprising only 3.6% of revenues from all environmental taxes in 2014, which corresponds to 0.09% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the EU (Figure 2). There is no sign of an increase in the share of resource taxes in environmental taxes over recent years, despite an increasing focus on material resources in EU policy, represented, for example, by the 2011 Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011) and the 2015 Circular Economy Package (EC, 2015a).    Figure 2.  Environment taxes by type as share of GDP, EU           This lack of progress may be a result of a number of obstacles that have been identified in relation to environmental fiscal reform. In its 2015 review of tax reforms in Member States (EC, 2015b), the European Commission refers to three key barriers in relation to the implementation of environmental taxation: (1) the potentially regressive nature of environmental taxes and possible associated equity issues; (2) the potentially harmful effect on the competitiveness of the sectors concerned; and (3) the administrative and enforcement costs of raising these taxes. The Commission, nevertheless, offers successful implementation strategies, namely transparency and early engagement with those affected by the tax, gradual implementation of the tax according to a pre-announced schedule and making such tax measures part of a broader policy package designed to achieve the specific environmental objective.   Analysis by the European Commission also suggests that higher energy taxes, compensated for by a reduction in labour taxation, can, in fact, improve competitiveness (Barrios et al., 2014). However, the administrative and enforcement costs must be in proportion to the political and environmental objectives that the tax aims to achieve. Other studies also suggest that any potentially negative impacts of environmental taxes can be reduced or addressed through careful design and implementation of tax adjustments (IEEP, 2015).   Another factor that limits changes to the relative levels of taxes is the high level of political attention that is generated by any changes to a countrys tax system. This can make any changes difficult and will tend to slow the pace of change. The political difficulties of modifying the fiscal system are reflected in a recent study by the European Commission, which assessed the environmental fiscal reform potential for the EU for different scenarios of political acceptance in various Member States (EC, 2016).   The absence of policies promoting a tax shift from labour to environmentally damaging goods and practices over past years, and the lack of plans by Member States to implement these changes, makes it unlikely that the 2020 objective will be met.    Country level information    When comparing the levels of environmental taxation between European countries, differences should be analysed with caution. For example, low revenues from environmental taxes can result from relatively low environmental tax rates, or from modified behavioural patterns resulting from high tax rates. On the other hand, higher levels of environmental tax revenues in a country could result from low tax rates that incentivise non-residents to purchase taxed products from the other side of a border (as is the case for petrol or diesel) (Eurostat, 2016).

Data on taxation         Explore interactive version        Figure 3 illustrates the large differences in the share of labour taxation in 2014 between countries, ranging from 32.9% in Bulgaria to 58.6% in Sweden. In 2014, only three EU Member States (Croatia, Greece and Slovenia) showed a share of above 10% of environmental taxes in total revenues from taxes and social contributions.   Five countries shifted taxation away from labour and towards the environment between 2003 and 2014 (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Poland and Slovenia), while 10 countries moved in the opposite direction (Austria, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, France, Luxembourg, Portugal, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Spain); however, some of these changes are quite small.   The 2015 review of tax reforms in Member States by the European Commission (EC, 2015b) identified a group consisting of approximately one third of EU Member States where there is particular scope for improving the design of environmental taxes. Suggested ways forward include restructuring vehicle taxation, indexing environmental taxes to inflation and adjusting fuel excise duties to reflect the carbon and energy content of different fuels.    Outlook beyond 2020    A recent report by the European Commission analysed the extent to which environmental taxes could be increased, based on good practice (EC, 2016). This report found that environmental taxes could increase across the EU from an average of 2.5% of GDP in 2013 to 3.6% by 2030. Countries reported that politically feasible increases in environmental taxes, especially energy taxes, are lower than estimated optimal rates. However, this gap reduces as one looks further into the future. The report concluded that, while, in the short term, the good-practice scenario is viewed as challenging, over the longer term nearly all the suggested taxes can be viewed as politically feasible.   The fiscal outlook in Europe has heightened political interest in the potential of revenue-neutral tax-shifting policies whereby the revenues from environmental taxes are used to reduce labour taxes. Longer term developments, including demographic changes and technological breakthroughs on energy and transport in the transition to a low-carbon, green economy, will contribute to the erosion of the current tax bases in European countries. These expected trends challenge the overall basis of current thinking on tax shifts. Some countries have already developed  new environmental tax instruments,  but much more work needs to be done on the design of resilient, long-term tax systems in Europe in the face of such systemic challenges (EEA, 2016).     About the indicator     Environmental taxes are defined as taxes whose tax base is a physical unit (or proxy of it) of something that has a proven, specific negative impact on the environment. Current environmental tax revenues stem from four types of taxes: energy taxes, transport taxes, pollution taxes and resource taxes. Pollution and resource taxes are reported for only 16 EU Member States, with Eurostat estimating the tax levels for the remaining countries.   Taxes on labour are defined as all personal income taxes, payroll taxes and the social contributions of employees and employers that are levied on labour income (both employed and non-employed).   Eurostat gathers data on environmental taxes for four categories (energy, transport, pollution and resources) using Table 9 from the European System of Accounts transmission programme. Since 2013, Eurostat has also collected data on environmental taxes by economic activity at a more detailed level, in application of Regulation (EU) No691/2011 on European environmental economic accounts.

"more-action-is-needed-to  More action is needed to protect the natural environment and people’s health   Substantial progress in cutting greenhouse gas emissions, air and other pollutants, and improving energy and material efficiency, needs to be complemented by more actions by EU Member States to fully apply agreed-to policies to better protect biodiversity, natural resources, and people’s health. These are the key findings of a new European Environment Agency (EEA) report which reviews key trends and outlook towards achieving EU 2020 environmental objectives.   The EEA ‘ Environmental indicator report 2016 ’ gives a snapshot of progress made so far by the 28 EU Member States in meeting a selected number of EU policy objectives. These are relevant to achieving the three key priority objectives of the EU’s 7th Environment Action Programme: natural capital; resource-efficient, low-carbon economy, and people’s health and well-being. The report complements  ‘the European environment –state and outlook 2015’ (SOER)  report.   The  7th   Environment Action Programme  provides an overarching framework for EU environment policy planning and implementation to 2020.

Greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of climate change. Climate change will further aggravate environmental problems by causing prolonged droughts and heatwaves, floods, storms, forest fires, and soil and coastal erosion, as well as new or more virulent forms of human, animal or plant disease. Climate change is also expected to significantly increase the pressure on Europes water resources.    Policy targets and progress    The EU has committed to achieving a reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions of at least 20% by 2020, compared with 1990 levels (EEA, 2016a). This objective is embodied in both European and international commitments and targets, which clearly align with the objectives of the 7th EAP described above.   The overall emissions reduction target is separated into one EU-wide target for large industrial installations, covered by the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and 28 binding national targets for all the emissions that are not in the EU ETS. These national targets, set under the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD), cover sectors such as households, buildings, transport, agriculture, services, waste and smaller industrial installations. The EU ETS is expected to deliver a 21% reduction in its emissions, and the non-ETS sectors should reduce emissions by 9% by 2020 (both compared with 2005 levels). Together, these will lead to a reduction of 20% in overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels.   Within the ETS system, the EU sets limits on emissions from high-emitting industry sectors. With these limits as a reference, companies can buy and sell emission allowances as needed. This cap-and-trade approach gives companies the flexibility they need to cut their emissions in the most cost-effective way. The EU ETS covers more than 11000 power stations and manufacturing plants in the 28 EU Member States, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Emissions from commercial aircraft flying within and between most of these countries are also covered. In 2014, EU ETS emissions represented around 42% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions.    Figure 1. GHG emission trends, projections and targets in the EU, 1990-2050.         In 2015, EU greenhouse gas emissions were already 22% below 1990 levels (see Figure 1). Preliminary greenhouse emission estimates indicate an expected 0.7 % increase for 2015 (EEA, 2016b). This follows an exceptional 4.0 % reduction the previous year, which was due to a particularly warm winter. Emissions from industries in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) continued to decrease in 2015. On the other hand, emissions not included in the ETS increased. In particular, transport emissions increased for the second year in a row.   The EU has improved its energy intensity over time. This has been because of energy efficiency improvements, structural changes in the economy and reduced energy consumption as a result of the 2008 economic downturn (for more information, see the Energy efficiency briefing ( AIRS_PO2.7, 2016 ) 1 ). This trend is primarily responsible for the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions observed in the EU between 2005 and 2013 (EEA, 2014). Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can also be attributed to a change in the mix of fossil fuels used and the increasing use of carbon-free energy sources, including renewable energy sources (RES) (for more information, see the Renewable energies briefing ( AIRS_PO2.9, 2016 ) 2 ), reflecting the effects of policies and measures supporting the deployment of RES (e.g. feed-in tariffs), the establishment of a carbon price through the EU ETS, and external factors such as fluctuations in fossil fuel prices (EEA, 2015a). The strong growth in the use of RES  particularly wind, solar and biomass  and the resulting increased proportion of RES in electricity production have also contributed to the reduction in emissions. Demand for energy to heat households was also lower during this period, as Europe has experienced milder winters on average since 1990 (EEA, 2015a, 2016b and 2016c).   As projected by the EU Member States, emissions are expected to decrease further to 23% by 2020 with the current measures that are already in place. Additional measures (currently planned by Member States) could further reduce emissions to almost 25% below 1990 levels. Most of the savings in greenhouse gas emissions are expected to take place as a result of the EU ETS (EEA, 2015a).    Country level information    To meet the 2020 GHG target, the EU adopted a climate and energy package in 2009, comprising a legislative set of binding targets, which defined a single target for all EU emissions covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and a set of national targets for all other emissions not covered by the EU ETS. Since 2005, which was the first year of operation of the EU ETS, the ETS sectors have seen reductions in emissions of approximately 24%. The main sectors that experienced particularly large decreases in emissions were cement clinker and lime. Reductions in emissions from combustion installations, which represent more than 70% of all ETS emissions and are dominated by electricity generation, are largely as a result of changes to the mixture of fuels used to produce heat and electricity. The use of hard coal and lignite fuels in electricity generation has declined since 2005 and electricity generation from renewable sources has increased considerably. The reduction in emissions may also have been enhanced as a result of improvements in transformation efficiency for electricity generation, which means that less primary energy was necessary to generate a constant quantity of electricity. The cement, lime and iron and steel sectors follow similar trends, with emissions increasing up to 2007 and then decreasing. These reductions in emissions were, to a large extent, driven by reduced production as a result of the economic downturn.   In contrast to the sectors in the EU ETS, which are regulated at EU level, it is the responsibility of EU Member States to define and implement national policies and measures to limit emissions from the sectors covered by the ESD, the residential and commercial, transport, agriculture, waste and smaller industrial installation sectors. In 2014, greenhouse gas emissions from the ESD sectors represented approximately 58% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions.   Figure 2.  GHG emissions under the Effort Sharing Decision, by country         The national emissions targets for 2020 range from a 20% reduction in emissions (compared with 2005 levels) to a 20% increase. Less wealthy countries are allowed emission increases in the ESD sectors, because their relatively higher economic growth is likely to be accompanied by higher emissions. Nevertheless, their targets represent a limit on their emissions compared with the emissions projected using business-as-usual growth rates. All Member States are therefore required to make an effort to reduce emissions (EC, 2015).   Examples of potential policies and measures that could be implemented to reduce emissions include reducing transport demand, promoting public transport, a shift away from transport based on fossil fuels, support schemes for the retrofitting of building stock, more efficient heating and cooling systems, renewable energy for heating and cooling, more climate-friendly farming practices and the conversion of livestock manure to biogas (EC, 2015).   The assessment of current progress towards the ESD targets compares the non-ETS emissions for each year with the annual national targets. In 2014, all Member States but one (Malta) were below their national ESD targets. The 2015 proxy data seem to confirm this trend across the EU (Figure 2).   National projections show that, in most Member States, ESD emissions will remain below annual ESD targets until 2020. However, in five Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg) emissions in 2020 could exceed targets if no additional measures are implemented.   Outlook beyond 2020   The EU has also adopted a long-term goal for 2050 of reducing Europes greenhouse gas emissions by 80  95% compared with 1990 levels. To ensure that the EU is on a cost-effective track towards meeting this objective, in 2014 the European Council adopted a new set of climate and energy targets for 2030 (EC, 2014). This includes a binding target of reducing emissions by at least 40% compared with 1990 levels.   Looking towards 2030, projections from Member States show that both the current measures in place and the additional national measures that were in the planning stage at the time when projections were made will not be able to deliver sufficient savings to enable the EU to achieve the reduction target of 40% below 1990 levels (Figure 1). The pace of greenhouse gas emission reductions is projected to slow down after 2020, despite the fact that mid- and long-term targets will require more rapid reductions. Existing policies and measures are expected to result in a reduction in emissions of 26% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, and the implementation of additional measures could increase this reduction to 29%.   Because of this projected shortfall, new policies and measures are currently being developed at EU level to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These policy options include measures applicable to the transport and land use sectors, as well as the reform of the ETS, which includes a more stringent cap to achieve reductions beyond 2020, as well as a post-2020 ESD and measures to enhance energy efficiency based on the 2030 framework for climate and energy policies.   About the indicator   The indicator presents past and future trends for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. In line with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and IPCC reporting guidelines, the indicator covers the following greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3 ). These are weighted by their global warming potential, aggregated and presented in CO 2 -equivalent units. The list of gases does not include the greenhouse gases that are ozone-depleting substances and are controlled by the Montreal Protocol. The indicator covers emissions from international aviation and excludes emissions or removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) and international shipping. For the past, the indicator uses the greenhouse gas inventory and ETS data. It also uses projection data reported by EU Member States in two scenarios: a with existing measures (WEM) scenario and a with additional measures (WAM) scenario. The WAM scenario takes into account measures planned but not yet adopted. However, not all EU Member States reported a WAM scenario, so the predicted reduction might not take all planned measures into account and therefore may be an underestimate.,    Indicator   EU indicator past trend   Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020     Total greenhouse gas emission trends and projections      Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared with 1990 levels - 2020 Climate and Energy Package        The decreasing trend of greenhouse gases and the future evolution as projected by the EU Member States indicate that the 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target will be met     For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the EEA Environmental indicator report 2016  Setting the scene The 7th EAP includes the objective for the EU to meet its 2020 climate and energy targets and to work towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80  95% by 2050, compared with 1990 levels (EU, 2013).

Consumption of meat, dairy, and fish and seafood products increased gradually between 1995 and 2008, but has stabilised since then. Levels of saturated fat and red meat consumption remain above dietary guidelines and result in high GHG and nitrogen emissions             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016       Setting the Scene    The 7th EAP calls for changes in consumption patterns and lifestyles to reduce the overall environmental impact of production and consumption, in particular in the food, housing and mobility sectors (EU, 2013). Meat and dairy products contribute around 6% of the economic value but 25% of the environmental impacts caused by total final consumption in the EU (Weidema et al., 2008). The food sector contributes strongly to climate change, eutrophication, land take and a host of other environmental problems (Bailey et al., 2014). This briefing presents trends in the consumption of animal-based food products (meat, dairy, fish and seafood), as a reduction in the demand for these products and a shift to other sources of protein has the potential to reduce the EUs environmental footprint while also delivering health benefits (EuroHealthNet, 2013). For the housing and mobility sectors, please see the Household energy consumption briefing ( AIRS_PO2.8, 2016 ) 1  and the Transport greenhouse gas emissions briefing ( AIRS_PO2.9, 2016 ). 2    Policy targets and progress   The food system is a major driver of environmental change, with implications for energy and water security. Although the EU has no explicit food policy, the food system cuts across a wide range of policy areas including agriculture, fisheries, biodiversity and health. The 7th EAP and the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011) share the objectives of reducing the impact of food production and consumption and reducing resource inputs by tackling food waste in particular.   Different food products have very different environmental footprints. Diets characterised by a high intake of animal products result in consumption of saturated fat and red meat in quantities that exceed dietary recommendations. Their production requires large areas of land and results in high greenhouse gas and nitrogen emissions. Therefore, a healthier diet can result in lower environmental impacts.   Intensively farmed beef has a carbon footprint seven times that of poultry. Land use and eutrophication loading are six times and four times higher, respectively, per kilogram. The environmental footprint of pork lies somewhere between the two for most impact categories (Weidema et al., 2008). Animal welfare issues related to intensive methods of poultry rearing are also a consideration when evaluating impact. In addition, while grazing animals can contribute positively to the biodiversity of agricultural land, overgrazing contributes to the lack of improvement in the conservation status of habitats associated with agricultural ecosystems; see  EU protected habitats briefing ( AIRS_PO1.8, 2016 ) . 3    Absolute and indexed meat, dairy and seafood consumption are shown in Figures 1 and 2.  Average per capita consumption of meat (all types),  dairy, and fish and seafood products generally increased in the EU-28 up until 2008 but have stabilised since then.    Figure 1. Average per capita consumption of meat, fish, seafood and dairy products, EU      Bovine meat consumption has reduced steadily over the monitoring period while poultry consumption has risen. The average citizen in the EU-28 ate 2.3kg less beef in 2011 than in 1995 (a 13% decrease), but 4.0kg more poultry (a 23% increase), with pork consumption remaining relatively stable (Figure 1). This shift will have led to a reduction in environmental impacts but this may have been somewhat offset by a 3.8kg per capita increase in cheese consumption. The shift from beef to poultry is also in line with health guidelines in guarding against cardiovascular disease (EuroHealthNet, 2013).   There is no explicit policy objective of reducing meat and dairy consumption for environmental reasons (Bailey et al., 2014). It may well be that European dietary changes have been brought about by increasing awareness of healthier diets, although price changes may also have had an effect. Beef prices, for example, reached record highs in 2013 (EC, 2014). Subsequently, the European Commission noted a rebound in meat and beef consumption in 2014 and projected a further 2% increase in 2015 continuing into 2016 (EC, 2015a).   Looking towards 2020, the 2013 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform is more neutral with respect to particular agricultural products than earlier CAPs. However, the recently adopted EUR500million aid package for farmers is aimed specifically at supporting cattle and pig farmers (EC, 2015b). A positive development is the increasing focus at both EU and Member State levels on reducing food waste, through actions in the  Circular Economy Package  (EC, 2015c) and  Member States waste prevention strategies .    Figure 2. Developments in per capita consumption of meat, fish and dairy products, EU (indexed)          Europeans ate on average about 2.7kg more fish and seafood each in 2011 than in 1995. About 1.8kg of this increase was consumption of freshwater fish, a 95% increase. The remaining 0.9kg of increased fish and seafood consumption comprised crustaceans (e.g. prawns, mussels), cephalopods (e.g. squid) and pelagic (bottom-dwelling) fish.   Imports of the majority of fish and crustacean products, mostly processed fish, to the EU increased by 44% between 2000 and 2010, to nearly 5million tonnes. Aquaculture in Europe accounts for about 20% of fish production. As aquaculture production in the EU-28 has been steady since 1995, increasing consumption has been met by imports (EEA, 2014).   The increase in the consumption of seafood during this period is also in line with healthy eating advice. However, again it is difficult to assess the environmental implications of this trend. About one third  of fish stocks  in the North-East Atlantic and half of the assessed commercial fish stocks in the Mediterranean Sea are being fished beyond safe biological limits; for further information on the status of commercial fish stocks please see the  Marine fish stocks briefing (AIRS_PO1.5) . 4  According to the 7th EAP, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (EU, 2008) target to achieve good environmental status by 2020 is coming under severe pressure, due in part to continued overfishing. The 7th EAP includes a target to urgently increase efforts to ensure that healthy fish stocks are achieved. This may be compromised by the increasing consumption of fish, depending on the species consumed.   Country level information   At the country level, the proportions of various food groups in consumption, and trends in these, vary greatly. Absolute levels of meat consumption per capita across the EU-28 also differ, ranging from 53kg/year in Bulgaria to 106kg/year in Austria in 2011. The differences between countries have reduced, however, since 1995.    Outlook beyond 2020    As a major greenhouse gas emitter, the food sector may need to undergo significant changes if the EU is to meet its 2050 target for an 80  95% reduction in greenhouse gases. Current policies aimed at reducing the impact of food are mostly focused on the production side, e.g. reducing inputs and better manure and slurry management. On the consumption side, the policy focus is largely limited to labelling schemes and reducing food waste. Given the health relevance and implications of meat, dairy, fish and seafood consumption for the population, potential environmental and health co-benefits, as well as conflicts and trade-offs, should be explored when considering options to reduce environmental pressures related to food consumption. However, it seems doubtful that the necessary gains needed by 2050 in reducing greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved without tackling meat and dairy consumption (Weidema et al., 2008; Bailey et al., 2014).   About the indicator   The indicator shows consumption of selected meat, dairy, fish and seafood products in the EU-28, between 1995 and 2011. The data were extracted from the  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO) statistics database. This indicator is defined as the supply of these products to the final consumer. The indicator is presented both in absolute quantities per capita per year (Figure 1) and in indexed form (Figure 2). The amount of food actually consumed may be lower than the quantity shown in the indicator because of wasted edible food by households and other final consumers.,    Indicator   EU indicator past trend   Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020     Consumption of meat, dairy, fish and seafood      Reduce the overall impact of production and consumption in the food sector - 7th EAP        Reducing the consumption of animal products and shifting to other sources of protein has the potential to reduce environmental impacts related to food. Consumption of meat, dairy, and fish and seafood products increased gradually between 1995 and 2008, but has stabilised since then. Levels of saturated fat and red meat consumption remain above dietary guidelines and result in high GHG and nitrogen emissions     For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the EEA Environmental indicator report 2016 Setting the Scene The 7th EAP calls for changes in consumption patterns and lifestyles to reduce the overall environmental impact of production and consumption, in particular in the food, housing and mobility sectors (EU, 2013). Meat and dairy products contribute around 6% of the economic value but 25% of the environmental impacts caused by total final consumption in the EU (Weidema et al., 2008). The food sector contributes strongly to climate change, eutrophication, land take and a host of other environmental problems (Bailey et al., 2014). This briefing presents trends in the consumption of animal-based food products (meat, dairy, fish and seafood), as a reduction in the demand for these products and a shift to other sources of protein has the potential to reduce the EUs environmental footprint while also delivering health benefits (EuroHealthNet, 2013). For the housing and mobility sectors, please see the Household energy consumption briefing (AIRS_PO2.8, 2016)1 and the Transport greenhouse gas emissions briefing (AIRS_PO2.9, 2016).2 Policy targets and progress The food system is a major driver of environmental change, with implications for energy and water security. Although the EU has no explicit food policy, the food system cuts across a wide range of policy areas including agriculture, fisheries, biodiversity and health. The 7th EAP and the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011) share the objectives of reducing the impact of food production and consumption and reducing resource inputs by tackling food waste in particular. Different food products have very different environmental footprints. Diets characterised by a high intake of animal products result in consumption of saturated fat and red meat in quantities that exceed dietary recommendations. Their production requires large areas of land and results in high greenhouse gas and nitrogen emissions. Therefore, a healthier diet can result in lower environmental impacts. Intensively farmed beef has a carbon footprint seven times that of poultry. Land use and eutrophication loading are six times and four times higher, respectively, per kilogram. The environmental footprint of pork lies somewhere between the two for most impact categories (Weidema et al., 2008). Animal welfare issues related to intensive methods of poultry rearing are also a consideration when evaluating impact. In addition, while grazing animals can contribute positively to the biodiversity of agricultural land, overgrazing contributes to the lack of improvement in the conservation status of habitats associated with agricultural ecosystems; see EU protected habitats briefing (AIRS_PO1.8, 2016).3 Absolute and indexed meat, dairy and seafood consumption are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Average per capita consumption of meat (all types), dairy, and fish and seafood products generally increased in the EU-28 up until 2008 but have stabilised since then. Figure 1. Average per capita consumption of meat, fish, seafood and dairy products, EU Bovine meat consumption has reduced steadily over the monitoring period while poultry consumption has risen. The average citizen in the EU-28 ate 2.3kg less beef in 2011 than in 1995 (a 13% decrease), but 4.0kg more poultry (a 23% increase), with pork consumption remaining relatively stable (Figure 1). This shift will have led to a reduction in environmental impacts but this may have been somewhat offset by a 3.8kg per capita increase in cheese consumption. The shift from beef to poultry is also in line with health guidelines in guarding against cardiovascular disease (EuroHealthNet, 2013). There is no explicit policy objective of reducing meat and dairy consumption for environmental reasons (Bailey et al., 2014). It may well be that European dietary changes have been brought about by increasing awareness of healthier diets, although price changes may also have had an effect. Beef prices, for example, reached record highs in 2013 (EC, 2014). Subsequently, the European Commission noted a rebound in meat and beef consumption in 2014 and projected a further 2% increase in 2015 continuing into 2016 (EC, 2015a). Looking towards 2020, the 2013 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform is more neutral with respect to particular agricultural products than earlier CAPs. However, the recently adopted EUR500million aid package for farmers is aimed specifically at supporting cattle and pig farmers (EC, 2015b). A positive development is the increasing focus at both EU and Member State levels on reducing food waste, through actions in the Circular Economy Package (EC, 2015c) and Member States waste prevention strategies. Figure 2. Developments in per capita consumption of meat, fish and dairy products, EU (indexed)  Europeans ate on average about 2.7kg more fish and seafood each in 2011 than in 1995. About 1.8kg of this increase was consumption of freshwater fish, a 95% increase. The remaining 0.9kg of increased fish and seafood consumption comprised crustaceans (e.g. prawns, mussels), cephalopods (e.g. squid) and pelagic (bottom-dwelling) fish. Imports of the majority of fish and crustacean products, mostly processed fish, to the EU increased by 44% between 2000 and 2010, to nearly 5million tonnes. Aquaculture in Europe accounts for about 20% of fish production. As aquaculture production in the EU-28 has been steady since 1995, increasing consumption has been met by imports (EEA, 2014). The increase in the consumption of seafood during this period is also in line with healthy eating advice. However, again it is difficult to assess the environmental implications of this trend. About one third of fish stocks in the North-East Atlantic and half of the assessed commercial fish stocks in the Mediterranean Sea are being fished beyond safe biological limits; for further information on the status of commercial fish stocks please see the Marine fish stocks briefing (AIRS_PO1.5).4 According to the 7th EAP, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (EU, 2008) target to achieve good environmental status by 2020 is coming under severe pressure, due in part to continued overfishing.

This will not only reduce the environmental impacts of the economy but could also have important socio-economic benefits in terms of value added and employment. This briefing presents trends in value added and employment in the EGSS. This reflects the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy towards a sustainable economy (EC, 2010), including growing employment in the green economy (EC, 2012). In the context of globalisation and technological change, the green economy offers potential for growth. Europe as a global leader in the development of environmental goods and services has significant potential for exporting this expertise (EC, 2015a).   Policy targets and progress   The increased awareness of the need to combat environmental pollution and preserve natural resources has expanded compliance obligations within the environmental acquis and increased the supply and demand of environmental goods and services, i.e. products to prevent, measure, control, limit, minimise or correct environmental damage and resource depletion.   The Europe 2020 Strategy does not include any targets on employment or output from the eco-industry sector, i.e. the EGSS. However, the EGSS environmentaleconomic account enables reporting on trends in output and employment and so informs on progress towards a green economy.The EGSS encompassesenvironmental protection activities related to preventing, reducing and eliminating pollution and any other degradation of the environment  andresource management activities which include management of energy resources (renewable energy production and equipment and installations for heat and energy saving).      Figure 1. Employment and value added in the Environmental Goods and Services Sector (EGSS) compared with the whole economy, EU        Figure 1 shows that, since 2003, the EGSS has seen faster growth in employment and value added than the total EU economy on average. The sectors contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) has grown from 1.4% in 2000 to 2.1% in 2013, and its contribution to total employment in the EU has grown from 2.8 million full-time equivalents (FTEs) to 4.2 million over the same period.   The continued expansion of the EGSS, even in the years immediately following the financial downturn, partially resulted from innovation and Europes competitiveness in the global market, but it was also supported by public spending on environmental protection and renewable energy (Grlach et al., 2014;  AIRS_PO2.13, 2016  1 ). Some of the most successful government interventions have been investment support schemes, which provided investors with a high degree of investment certainty. Especially in difficult economic times, governments can play a significant role in supporting private investment in the EGSS by guaranteeing the certainty needed by investors (Grlach et al., 2014).   Growth in both environmental protection activities and resource management activities has been strong but has been particularly high in the resource management area, whose value added grew from EUR50.7 billion in 2003 to EUR116.7 billion in 2013 (at 2010 prices). While the renewable energy sector was the key driver in this growth, environmental protection activities still represent the major element of the EGSS, with a value added of EUR156 billion in 2013.   EU employment in environmental protection and resource management activities was estimated at 4.2 million FTEs in 2013 (Figure 2). Employment trends were mainly driven by the growing importance of activities that manage energy resources, in particular the production of energy from renewable sources, the production of wind and solar power stations and equipment and installations for heat and energy saving (Eurostat, 2016).        Figure 2. Employment by activity in the Environmental Goods and Services Sector, EU          Despite the successes of the sector, recent trends are not so positive, with growth in employment and value added in the sector having slowed since 2011. This may be explained by increasing competition from the United States and China (Grlach et al., 2014) and a decrease in domestic investments in renewable energy. In 2013, EU investment in renewables fell by 44% compared with the previous year as a result of ongoing uncertainty on the future of support mechanisms and lower investment capacity in some EU countries (UNEP, 2016) ( AIRS_PO2.6, 2016 ). 2  Overall, the future prospects for growth of the EGSS are strongly dependent on continuing ambitious renewable energy and green growth policies in Europe and how these impact on competition with the United States and China.   The overall increase in employment and value added in the EGSS sector is a positive development. However, a greener economy is not inclusive and socially sustainable by default, and the transition phase is likely to entail some challenges, particularly within certain sectors and certain types of jobs. Consequently, a comprehensive approach is needed that ensures that green jobs are also decent jobs that contribute to social inclusion (ILO, 2008).     Outlook beyond 2020   An expanding EGSS is a key factor in achieving low-carbon growth decoupled from resource use, as envisaged in the 7th EAP. Policies on energy efficiency and renewable energy (EC, 2015b) and waste recycling (EC, 2015c) cover a period beyond 2020, suggesting that there could be long-term growth in the EGSS. Further expansion of the EGSS could be assisted through ambitious renewable energy and green growth policies at the EU and national levels but also via more direct assistance such as investment support schemes that provide investors with a high degree of investment certainty.    About the indicator    This briefing uses data from the EGSS account, which is a module of the European environmentaleconomic accounts. Environmental accounts analyse the interaction between the economy and the environment by organising environmental information in a way that is consistent with national accounts. The EGSS is defined as that part of a countrys economy that is engaged in producing goods and services that are used in environmental protection activities and resource management either domestically or abroad. The income created by the EGSS is expressed in terms of gross value added (at 2010 prices), which is the difference between output and intermediate consumption. Employment in the EGSS is expressed in terms of full-time equivalent jobs.   The data are broken down by industry (e.g. services, construction, etc.); environmental protection class (e.g. wastewater management, waste management, protection of biodiversity and landscapes); and resource management class (e.g. water management, energy resource management). The EGSS does not cover a number of resource management economic activities, e.g. the management of forest resources, the management of wild flora and fauna and research and development on resource management.   European environmental accounts are established by Regulation (EU) No691/2011 on European environmental economic accounts. From 2017, reporting of data on the EGSS will be mandatory and standardised (Eurostat, 2015). Current data are a combination of Eurostat estimates with some Member State data reported through voluntary surveys. There are some comparability issues at country level in terms of coverage, time series availability and the use of different classifications or approaches for calculating employment data.

"transport-ghg-emissions  Transport greenhouse gas emissions  ghg emissions emissions from transport            Indicator       EU indicator past trend       Selected objective to be met by 2020        Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020           Greenhouse gas emissions from transport               Reduce the overall environmental impact of production and consumption in the mobility sector -7th EAP                   Past transport greenhouse gas emissions increased from 1990 to 2014 despite a decline between 2008 and 2013. It is uncertain if emissions will reduce by 2020, since according to projections by the EU Member States emissions will remain more or less stable between 2015 and 2020             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016       Setting the scene    The 7th EAP calls for a reduction in the environmental impact of mobility (EU, 2013). Transport (i.e. mobility) is a major contributor to climate change, air pollution, noise, natural resource depletion and land fragmentation. Reducing the environmental impact of transport is usually done by reducing the demand for travel, introducing new, cleaner technologies and shifting towards less environmentally damaging transport modes. Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector have been used in this briefing as a proxy indicator for the overall environmental impacts of the transport sector. These emissions reflect the level and efficiency of the sectors activity as well as the mix of transport modes. In addition, climate change (and therefore greenhouse gas emissions) is one of the most significant environmental issues, and transport contributes about one quarter of the EUs total greenhouse gas emissions.   Policy targets and progress   In 2011, the European Commission published a White Paper on transport entitled Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area  Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system (EC, 2011). It acts as a framework to guide future policy developments in the transport sector over the next decade. The White Paper sets out 10 goals for a competitive and resource-efficient transport system, serving as benchmarks for achieving the target of a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the EU transport sector by 2050 (from 1990 levels).   From 1990 to 2014, greenhouse gas emissions from transport increased by 20.1% compared with 1990 levels (see Figure 1). This increase comes despite improvements in the efficiency of transport and is in line with increases in the level of economic activity as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) as well as increases in demand for transport (both freight and passenger) (EEA, 2016a, 2016b).   Nevertheless, emissions decreased from 2008 to 2013, in part because of the lower levels of economic activity  manifesting also in lower levels of freight transport (EEA, 2016b)  following the 2008 economic downturn, as well as further implementation of transport efficiency measures.   Road transport accounts for 72% of the total greenhouse gas emissions of the sector (EEA, 2016c). Energy efficiency improvements in road transport played a key role in limiting the increase of road transport emissions. Such improvements were brought about in part by means of increasingly stringent technical standards, including the average CO 2  emission standards for new passenger cars (EU, 2009) and vans (EU, 2011). The increased use of less carbon-intensive fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and biofuel blends, has also led to lower road transport emissions (EEA, 2015).   Figure 1. Greenhouse gas emissions from transport, EU        It is uncertain if transport greenhouse gas emissions will reduce by 2020, since according to projections by the EU Member States, emissions for the EU (including international aviation but excluding international shipping) will remain more or less stable between 2015 and 2020 in both scenarios: with existing measures and with additional measures (EEA, 2016d, 2016e). Preliminary estimates for 2015 emissions show, nevertheless, an increase of 2.3% above 2014 levels (EEA, 2016f).          Country level information     Figure 2. Change in greenhouse gas emissions from transport, 1990 to 2014, by country         Outlook beyond 2020   The 10 goals set by the European Commission White Paper on Transport (EC, 2011) are expected to lead to the future introduction of new EU policies to increase the efficiency of Europes transport sector. The main target of the White Paper is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40% of 1990 levels by 2050. A key assumption in the White Paper is that technologies that contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions will be increasingly available, especially after 2030, such as the electrification of transport and more intensive use of advanced biofuels.   A modal shift away from road transport is also a key element of the EUs decarbonisation ambitions. The White Paper explicitly states the ambition to shift 30% of road transport for distances over 300km to rail and inland navigation by 2030, and more than 50% by 2050.   Nevertheless, total transport demand is predicted to continue growing during the 20202030 period in line with the 20102020 patterns (1% a year for passenger transport (passenger km) and 1.5% for freight transport (tonne km)) and at lower rates between 2030 and 2050 (0.7% a year for passenger transport and 0.8% for freight transport) (EC, 2016).   Integrated measures addressing both production and consumption would therefore be needed in the long run in order to, inter alia, contain the expected increase in transport demand and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from transport by 60% by 2050.   About the indicator   This indicator presents the total EU greenhouse gas emissions from transport including emissions from international aviation but excluding emissions from international maritime transport. Greenhouse gas emissions include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The individual gases were converted into greenhouse gas emissions by being weighted according to their global warming potentials following the relevant guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Transport (i.e. mobility) is a major contributor to climate change, air pollution, noise, natural resource depletion and land fragmentation. Reducing the environmental impact of transport is usually done by reducing the demand for travel, introducing new, cleaner technologies and shifting towards less environmentally damaging transport modes. Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector have been used in this briefing as a proxy indicator for the overall environmental impacts of the transport sector. These emissions reflect the level and efficiency of the sectors activity as well as the mix of transport modes. In addition, climate change (and therefore greenhouse gas emissions) is one of the most significant environmental issues, and transport contributes about one quarter of the EUs total greenhouse gas emissions. Policy targets and progress In 2011, the European Commission published a White Paper on transport entitled Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area  Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system (EC, 2011). It acts as a framework to guide future policy developments in the transport sector over the next decade. The White Paper sets out 10 goals for a competitive and resource-efficient transport system, serving as benchmarks for achieving the target of a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the EU transport sector by 2050 (from 1990 levels). From 1990 to 2014, greenhouse gas emissions from transport increased by 20.1% compared with 1990 levels (see Figure 1). This increase comes despite improvements in the efficiency of transport and is in line with increases in the level of economic activity as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) as well as increases in demand for transport (both freight and passenger) (EEA, 2016a, 2016b). Nevertheless, emissions decreased from 2008 to 2013, in part because of the lower levels of economic activity  manifesting also in lower levels of freight transport (EEA, 2016b)  following the 2008 economic downturn, as well as further implementation of transport efficiency measures. Road transport accounts for 72% of the total greenhouse gas emissions of the sector (EEA, 2016c). Energy efficiency improvements in road transport played a key role in limiting the increase of road transport emissions. Such improvements were brought about in part by means of increasingly stringent technical standards, including the average CO2 emission standards for new passenger cars (EU, 2009) and vans (EU, 2011). The increased use of less carbon-intensive fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and biofuel blends, has also led to lower road transport emissions (EEA, 2015). Figure 1. Greenhouse gas emissions from transport, EU  It is uncertain if transport greenhouse gas emissions will reduce by 2020, since according to projections by the EU Member States, emissions for the EU (including international aviation but excluding international shipping) will remain more or less stable between 2015 and 2020 in both scenarios: with existing measures and with additional measures (EEA, 2016d, 2016e). Preliminary estimates for 2015 emissions show, nevertheless, an increase of 2.3% above 2014 levels (EEA, 2016f).  Country level information Figure 2. Change in greenhouse gas emissions from transport, 1990 to 2014, by country  Outlook beyond 2020 The 10 goals set by the European Commission White Paper on Transport (EC, 2011) are expected to lead to the future introduction of new EU policies to increase the efficiency of Europes transport sector. The main target of the White Paper is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40% of 1990 levels by 2050. A key assumption in the White Paper is that technologies that contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions will be increasingly available, especially after 2030, such as the electrification of transport and more intensive use of advanced biofuels. A modal shift away from road transport is also a key element of the EUs decarbonisation ambitions. The White Paper explicitly states the ambition to shift 30% of road transport for distances over 300km to rail and inland navigation by 2030, and more than 50% by 2050. Nevertheless, total transport demand is predicted to continue growing during the 20202030 period in line with the 20102020 patterns (1% a year for passenger transport (passenger km) and 1.5% for freight transport (tonne km)) and at lower rates between 2030 and 2050 (0.7% a year for passenger transport and 0.8% for freight transport) (EC, 2016). Integrated measures addressing both production and consumption would therefore be needed in the long run in order to, inter alia, contain the expected increase in transport demand and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from transport by 60% by 2050.

This briefing focuses on housing aspects, while food ( AIRS_PO2.10, 2016 ) 1  and mobility ( AIRS_PO2.9 ) 2  are dealt with in two other related briefings. The construction and use of housing leads to a number of environmental impacts ranging from land takeand the consumption of resourcesto the production of waste during construction and demolition. The largest environmental impacts arguably result from energy consumption during the use phase.    Policy targets and progress   There is no environmental acquis equivalent to the 7thEAP selected objective. The key EU policies that influence household energy use are the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD; EU, 2010a), the Energy Labelling Directive (EU, 2010b), theEcodesign Directive (EU, 2009)and the Energy Efficiency Directive (EU, 2012).The EPBD requires Member States to set minimum energy performance standards for new buildings,to establish inspection schemes for heating and air conditioning systems or to put in place measureswith equivalent effect,and to display energyperformancecertificates in building sale or rental advertisements. The Directive alsorequires all new buildings to be near zero energy by 2020 (2018 for public buildings). The Energy Efficiency Directive requires countries to set indicative targets for energy consumption, pursue renovation of at least 3% of buildings owned and occupied bycentral government annually and draw up long-term plans for renovation strategies. The Energy Labelling Directive aims to encourageproducers and consumers to favour more energy-efficientappliances, whilethe Ecodesign Directivesetsminimum standards for a growing number of appliances and other energy-related products.    Figure 1 shows that the final energy consumption of households in the EUhas been declining since 2005.      Figure 1. Climate correctedfinal energy consumption in the households sector          Energy efficiency policies have led to reductions in energy consumption, while lifestyle changes have had the opposite effect. Energy efficiency improvements in space heating and the use of more efficient electrical appliances, as well as behavioural changes driven by higher energy prices and the 2008 economic downturn all contributed to reductions in overall energy consumption. An increase in the number of appliances, in the average size of dwellings, in the number of dwellingsand in the level of comfort partially offset efficiency improvements.   Approximately two thirdsof energy used byhouseholdsin Europe isfor space heating. Energy efficiency improvements for space heating occurred as a result of the improved energy performance of the building envelope and increased efficiency of the heating equipment.In 2013, a number of EU regulations on labelling and ecodesign for space heating equipment were introduced, and they are expected to result in further reductions in energy consumption in the residential sector and, consequently, areduction in the associated environmental impacts (JRC, 2016).   Improvements in the energy efficiency of large appliancesis driven by EU directives on mandatory energy labelling andecodesign. The proportion of the most efficient appliances (A+, A++ or, more recently, A+++) has increased significantly: from 10% in 2005 to 96% in 2014 for refrigerators, and from 16.5% to 90% for washing machines (EEA, 2016).   On 25 February 2015, the Commission adoptedA framework strategy for a resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy (EC, 2015). The framework creates the momentum to bring about a transition to a low-carbon, secure and competitive energy system along five closely related and mutually reinforcing dimensions: security of supply, a fully integrated energy market, energy efficiency, climate change, and research and innovation.    Looking to the future, the energy efficiency targets set under the revised Energy Efficiency Directiveand Energy Union processshould help to keep the momentum towards increasing energy efficiencyand lead to further reductions inthe energy consumptionof households.   Country Level Information   Figure 2 shows the annual average energy household consumption per square metreforEU countries in 2005 compared with 2014. The datahave been corrected for annual variations in weather across all countries.   Energy use, measured in kilograms of oil equivalent (koe) persquare metre,differs widely betweencountries because of the stateand age of the building stock, the size of the dwelling, the heating/cooling systems used and energy efficiency measures. In 2014, energy consumption for space heating ranged fromless than10koe/m 2 in countries such as Spain, Bulgaria and Italy to more than 14koe/m 2  incountries such as Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Finland and Poland.    Figure 2. Climate corrected average energy consumption per dwelling in 2005 and 2014 in selected EU countries         Outlook beyond 2020    Energy use in households accounts for about one quarter of all the energy usedin the EU. Therefore reductions in household energy consumption are necessary if Europe is to achieve the low-carbon growth envisaged in the long-term vision of the 7th EAP.   Reducing energy consumption inexistingbuildings presents a major challenge to achieving this goal as the turnover of the building stock is slow and behavioural changes take time to implement on a large scale. Progress can be achieved bymaking better use of climate finance and revenues from energy taxation, for example to support large-scale renovation and local authorities, andby encouraging changes in consumers behaviour throughthe creation of framework conditions that can better enable the consumer to participate in the energymarket (OpenExp, 2016).   The recently launched Heating and Cooling Strategy (EC, 2016) should help reduce the energy consumption of households by promoting increased use ofdistrict heating and better integration of renewable energy sources.   About the indicator   Figure 1 represents final energy consumption by households. This is the total energy consumed each year by the household sector. It excludes energy lost in the production and transport of the energy to households, as well as the energy consumption of household members for transport. The data are corrected to account forannual variations in weather using heating degree-days for space heating. Figure 2 represents the energy consumption of households for space heating per square metre. The indicator is calculated as the ratio between final energy consumption of households for space heating corrected for annual variations in weather using heating degree-days across countries and the average size of dwellings in each Member State multiplied by the number of dwellings (ODYSSEE, 2016).,    Indicator   EU indicator past trend   Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlookof the EU meetingthe selectedobjective by 2020     Energy consumption by households      Reduce the overall environmental impact of production and consumption in the housing sector - 7th EAP        The energy consumption of households in the EU decreased.

Air pollution is the number one environmental cause of death in the EU, responsible for more than 400000 premature deaths per year (EEA, 2016a). According to WHO studies (WHO, 2013, 2014), exposure to particulate matter (PM) can cause or aggravate cardiovascular and lung diseases, heart attacks and arrhythmias, affect the central nervous system and the reproductive system and cause cancer. Exposure to high ozone (O 3 ) concentrations can cause breathing problems, trigger asthma, reduce lung function and cause lung diseases. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) increases symptoms of bronchitis in asthmatic children and reduces lung function growth. Health-related external costs range from EUR330 billion to EUR940 billion per year, depending on the valuation methodology, with evidence on the impacts of chronic ozone exposure adding around 5% to this total (EC, 2013).      Policy targets and progress   A chief cornerstone of the EU environmental acquis in the field of air quality is the Air Quality Directive (EU, 2008). This directive set a number of air quality standards not to be exceeded by a certain year and thereafter.   The communication on the Clean Air Programme for Europe (EC, 2013) sets the short-term objective of achieving full compliance with existing legislation by 2020 at the latest, as well as the long-term objective of seeing no exceedances of the WHO guideline levels for human health. The most troublesome pollutants in terms of harm to human health are particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and ground-level ozone (O 3 ). The European air quality standards and the WHO air quality guidelines (WHO, 2006) for these pollutants are displayed in Table 1.   Table 1. Air quality standards, under the EU Air Quality Directive, and WHO air quality guidelines          Notes:  1. (*) Not considered in the indicator, where only the most stringent EU standards are used: the daily limit value for PM 10  and the annual limit value for NO 2 . According to the WHO air quality guidelines, the annual average for PM takes precedence over the 24-hour average, since, at low levels, there is less concern about episodic excursions.  2. In line with the Air Quality Directive: limit value shall mean a level fixed on the basis of scientific knowledge, with the aim of avoiding, preventing or reducing harmful effects on human health and/or the environment as a whole, to be attained within a given period and not to be exceeded once attained; target value shall mean a level fixed with the aim of avoiding, preventing or reducing harmful effects on human health and/or the environment as a whole, to be attained where possible over a given period.   Source: EU, 2008; WHO, 2006.    Figures 1 and 2 show the percentage of the urban population exposed to air pollutant concentrations above both EU standards (Figure 1) and WHO guidelines (Figure 2).   Figure 1. EU urban population exposed to air pollutant concentrations above selected air quality standards of the EU Air Quality Directive        Figure 2.EU urban population exposed to air pollutant concentrations above WHO air quality guidelines          Around one sixth of Europeans currently living in urban areas are exposed to air pollutant levels exceeding some EU air quality standards. Moreover, up to 96% are exposed to levels of some air pollutants deemed damaging to health by the WHOs more stringent guidelines(EEA, 2016a).      Particulate matter (PM    )   Between 2006 and 2014, 8  17% of the EUs urban population is estimated to have been exposed to concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) in excess of the EU target value set for the protection of human health (Figure 1).With respect to the more stringent WHO guideline value (Figure 2), a much larger proportion of the urban population (85  97%) was exposed to concentrations above this threshold. The time series are considered too short to draw any firm conclusions on changes over time.   Notwithstanding limitations in data coverage in the early 2000s, a significant proportion of the EU urban population (16  42%) was exposed to concentrations of coarse dust particles (PM 10 ) in excess of the EU daily limit value set for the protection of human health during the 20002014 period (Figure 1). A slightly decreasing tendency can be observed throughout the whole period.   For the more stringent WHO guideline value (Figure 2), a higher proportion of the urban population (50  92%) was exposed to concentrations above this threshold. Here, a decreasing tendency is also observed, as in the case of the EU limit value.   PM may be categorised as either primary (i.e. directly emitted to the atmosphere) or secondary (i.e. formed in the atmosphere from the so-called precursor gases).   Primary PM originates from both natural and anthropogenic sources. The main emitter sectors are commercial, institutional and household fuel combustion and industry. In third place, agriculture is listed for PM 10  and transport for PM 2.5 . All these sectors reduced their PM emissions in the EU in the 20002014 period, although higher relative reductions were observed for industry and transport and only small reductions were observed for the other two sectors.   With the exception of ammonia, the reductions in emissions of the other secondary PM precursors (nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, and non-methane volatile organic compounds) were much larger than the reductions in primary PM from 2000 to 2014 in the EU.   However, the reductions in both primary PM and precursors have not led to equivalent drops in the concentrations of PM. This is due to the fact that, due to chemical reactions of the precursors to form secondary particles, the relationships between emissions and concentrations are not linear. It can also be explained by uncertainties in the reported emissions of primary PM from the commercial, institutional and household fuel combustion sector, by intercontinental transport of PM and its precursor gases from outside Europe, and by the contribution of natural sources to PM concentrations (EEA, 2016b).   The contributions of the different emission sources to ambient air concentrations depend not only on the amount of pollutant emitted, but also on proximity to source, emission conditions (such as height and temperature) and other factors, such as dispersion conditions and topography. Sectors with low emission heights, such as traffic and household fuel combustion, generally make a more significant contribution to surface concentrations than emissions from high stacks.   Ozone (O 3 )   Although reductions in European emissions of O 3  precursors have led to lower peak concentrations of O 3 , the current target value is frequently exceeded on more than 25 days a year. In the 20002014 period, between 8% (in 2014) and 55% (in 2003) of the urban population was exposed to concentrations above thetarget value (Figure 1). In the last 7 years, the proportion of the urban population exposed has not exceeded 20%, with no significant change over time.   In relation to the more stringent WHO guideline (Figure 2), the proportion of the population exposed to concentrations above the guideline value is as high as 94  99%, with no discernible change over time.   O 3  concentrations are determined by emissions of its precursors and by meteorological conditions: ozone is formed in sunny conditions with high temperatures. Apart from reductions in anthropogenic emissions of O 3  precursors, there have been increases in natural emissions and also in intercontinental transport of O 3  and its precursors. Additional factors are also likely to mask the effects of European measures to reduce anthropogenic emissions of O 3  precursors, including climate change, emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds from vegetation (difficult to quantify) and fire plumes from forest and other biomass fires (EEA, 2010). Formation of tropospheric ozone from increased concentrations of methane may also contribute to the sustained O 3  levels in Europe.   Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 )   Between 2000 and 2014, the fraction of the urban population exposed to concentrations in excess of the EU limit value and the identical WHO guideline value gradually decreased to around 10%, with a minimum of 7% in 2014 (Figures 1 and 2). The highest exposure of the urban population to NO 2 , 31%, occurred in 2003.   Enforcement of current legislation has resulted in a reduction in NO x  emissions in all sectors. Nevertheless, emissions from transport keep NO 2  concentrations high close to main roads.   Based on the current trends, explained above, and because of their high and widespread exceedances in urban areas, it is unlikely that air quality standards for these pollutants will be met by 2020, while achieving air quality in line with the WHO guidelines is much further away. Effective air quality policies require action and cooperation on global, European, national and local levels, which must reach across most economic sectors and engage the public. Holistic solutions must be found that involve technological development, structural changes  including the optimisation of infrastructures and urban planning  and behavioural changes. These will be necessary to deliver a level of air quality across the EU that is conducive to the protection of human health (EEA, 2016b).   Country-level information   Table 2 provides information on the urban population exposed to concentrations of air pollutants above the EU air quality objectives by country for the year 2014. Variations from country to country are not only related to the different pollutant concentrations but also to:     the number of available data series (monitoring stations and/or selected cities), which will influence the total monitored population;   the uneven distribution of traffic and background stations in the different countries.        Table 2. Urban population exposed to concentrations of air pollutants above selected air quality standards of the Air Quality Directive, 2014          Note: NA = no available data, for further information please see indicator CSI004.  Source: Air pollution country fact sheets (EEA, 2014) updated with 2014 data. The 2014 data aggregated at EU level are also available (EEA, 2016a, 2016c).    Outlook beyond 2020   In 2013, the European Commission proposed a Clean Air Policy Package for Europe (EC, 2013), which aims to achieve full compliance with existing air quality legislation by 2020, and to further improve Europes air quality by 2030 and beyond. As a result of this package, it has recently been agreed to revise the 2001 National Emission Ceilings Directive (EU, 2001). The proposed new directive establishes new national emission reduction commitments applicable from 2020 and stricter commitments from 2030 for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds, ammonia and PM 2.5 . In addition, and as part of the package, a new directive, the Medium Combustion Plant Directive, was approved in November 2015 (EU, 2015). This directive regulates sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust emissions from the combustion of fuels in medium-sized combustion plants (with a rated thermal input of 1and up to 50megawatt).   These new commitments, together with the on-going implementation of air quality improvement measures at national, regional and local levels, are expected to improve air quality in Europe. However, the changes in meteorological conditions due to climate change are expected to increase O 3  concentrations as a result of expected increased emissions of both specific O 3  precursors and emissions from wildfires; these can increase under periods of extensive drought (EEA, 2015).   Finally, it is expected that the age group composition of the EU population will continue to shift towards higher numbers of the elderly because of continuing increases in life expectancy (Eurostat, 2016). The overall potential air pollution-related health impact of this change remains uncertain.   About the indicator   This briefing shows the proportion of the EU urban population that is exposed to various potentially harmful concentrations of pollutants in excess of both EU standards and WHO guidelines set for the protection of human health. For further information on the methodology, please refer to the EEA indicator Exceedance of air quality limit values in urban populations (EEA, 2016a).   The indicator focuses on those pollutants that are most relevant in terms of health effects and urban concentrations: PM, both PM 10  and fine PM or PM 2.5 ; O 3 ; and NO 2 . When there is more than one standard, only the most stringent one is used. The indicator is based on measurements of air pollutants reported under the Air Quality Directive (EU 2008) and the Decisions on the exchange of information (EU, 2011).   Most air pollution is man-made and derives from combustion of fossil or biomass fuels used in industry, transport and heating; industrial and agricultural processes; and other sources (EEA, 2016b). As most of these sources, particularly emissions from cars, are concentrated in urban areas, where most of the European population lives, air quality in urban areas is a useful proxy for tracking progress towards meeting the standards set out in the Air Quality Directive.,     Indicator   EU indicator past trend    Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020     Exceedance of air quality limit values in urban areas(nitrogen dioxide: NO2; coarse dust particles: PM10; ozone: O3;fine particulate matter: PM2.5)     NO2, PM10  O3, PM2.5   Meet Air Quality Directive standards for the protection of human health  Air Quality Directive        Despite reductions in concentrations in urban areas of coarse dust particles and nitrogen dioxide and no significant change in ozone and fine particulate matter, due to their high and widespread exceedance levels in urban areas it is unlikely that the air quality standards for these pollutants will be met by 2020     For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the EEA Environmental indicator report 2016 Setting the Scene The 7th EAP (EU, 2013) aims to significantly improve outdoor air quality and move closer to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (WHO, 2006) by 2020. Air pollution is the number one environmental cause of death in the EU, responsible for more than 400000 premature deaths per year (EEA, 2016a). According to WHO studies (WHO, 2013, 2014), exposure to particulate matter (PM) can cause or aggravate cardiovascular and lung diseases, heart attacks and arrhythmias, affect the central nervous system and the reproductive system and cause cancer. Exposure to high ozone (O3) concentrations can cause breathing problems, trigger asthma, reduce lung function and cause lung diseases. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) increases symptoms of bronchitis in asthmatic children and reduces lung function growth. Health-related external costs range from EUR330 billion to EUR940 billion per year, depending on the valuation methodology, with evidence on the impacts of chronic ozone exposure adding around 5% to this total (EC, 2013).  Policy targets and progress A chief cornerstone of the EU environmental acquis in the field of air quality is the Air Quality Directive (EU, 2008). This directive set a number of air quality standards not to be exceeded by a certain year and thereafter. The communication on the Clean Air Programme for Europe (EC, 2013) sets the short-term objective of achieving full compliance with existing legislation by 2020 at the latest, as well as the long-term objective of seeing no exceedances of the WHO guideline levels for human health. The most troublesome pollutants in terms of harm to human health are particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ground-level ozone (O3). The European air quality standards and the WHO air quality guidelines (WHO, 2006) for these pollutants are displayed in Table 1. Table 1. Air quality standards, under the EU Air Quality Directive, and WHO air quality guidelines  Notes: 1. (*) Not considered in the indicator, where only the most stringent EU standards are used: the daily limit value for PM10 and the annual limit value for NO2. According to the WHO air quality guidelines, the annual average for PM takes precedence over the 24-hour average, since, at low levels, there is less concern about episodic excursions. 2. In line with the Air Quality Directive: limit value shall mean a level fixed on the basis of scientific knowledge, with the aim of avoiding, preventing or reducing harmful effects on human health and/or the environment as a whole, to be attained within a given period and not to be exceeded once attained; target value shall mean a level fixed with the aim of avoiding, preventing or reducing harmful effects on human health and/or the environment as a whole, to be attained where possible over a given period. Source: EU, 2008; WHO, 2006. Figures 1 and 2 show the percentage of the urban population exposed to air pollutant concentrations above both EU standards (Figure 1) and WHO guidelines (Figure 2). Figure 1. EU urban population exposed to air pollutant concentrations above selected air quality standards of the EU Air Quality Directive  Figure 2.EU urban population exposed to air pollutant concentrations above WHO air quality guidelines  Around one sixth of Europeans currently living in urban areas are exposed to air pollutant levels exceeding some EU air quality standards. Moreover, up to 96% are exposed to levels of some air pollutants deemed damaging to health by the WHOs more stringent guidelines(EEA, 2016a).  Particulate matter (PM) Between 2006 and 2014, 8  17% of the EUs urban population is estimated to have been exposed to concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in excess of the EU target value set for the protection of human health (Figure 1).With respect to the more stringent WHO guideline value (Figure 2), a much larger proportion of the urban population (85  97%) was exposed to concentrations above this threshold. The time series are considered too short to draw any firm conclusions on changes over time. Notwithstanding limitations in data coverage in the early 2000s, a significant proportion of the EU urban population (16  42%) was exposed to concentrations of coarse dust particles (PM10) in excess of the EU daily limit value set for the protection of human health during the 20002014 period (Figure 1). A slightly decreasing tendency can be observed throughout the whole period. For the more stringent WHO guideline value (Figure 2), a higher proportion of the urban population (50  92%) was exposed to concentrations above this threshold. Here, a decreasing tendency is also observed, as in the case of the EU limit value. PM may be categorised as either primary (i.e. directly emitted to the atmosphere) or secondary (i.e. formed in the atmosphere from the so-called precursor gases). Primary PM originates from both natural and anthropogenic sources. The main emitter sectors are commercial, institutional and household fuel combustion and industry. In third place, agriculture is listed for PM10 and transport for PM2.5. All these sectors reduced their PM emissions in the EU in the 20002014 period, although higher relative reductions were observed for industry and transport and only small reductions were observed for the other two sectors. With the exception of ammonia, the reductions in emissions of the other secondary PM precursors (nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, and non-methane volatile organic compounds) were much larger than the reductions in primary PM from 2000 to 2014 in the EU. However, the reductions in both primary PM and precursors have not led to equivalent drops in the concentrations of PM. This is due to the fact that, due to chemical reactions of the precursors to form secondary particles, the relationships between emissions and concentrations are not linear. It can also be explained by uncertainties in the reported emissions of primary PM from the commercial, institutional and household fuel combustion sector, by intercontinental transport of PM and its precursor gases from outside Europe, and by the contribution of natural sources to PM concentrations (EEA, 2016b). The contributions of the different emission sources to ambient air concentrations depend not only on the amount of pollutant emitted, but also on proximity to source, emission conditions (such as height and temperature) and other factors, such as dispersion conditions and topography. Sectors with low emission heights, such as traffic and household fuel combustion, generally make a more significant contribution to surface concentrations than emissions from high stacks. Ozone (O3) Although reductions in European emissions of O3 precursors have led to lower peak concentrations of O3, the current target value is frequently exceeded on more than 25 days a year. In the 20002014 period, between 8% (in 2014) and 55% (in 2003) of the urban population was exposed to concentrations above thetarget value (Figure 1). In the last 7 years, the proportion of the urban population exposed has not exceeded 20%, with no significant change over time. In relation to the more stringent WHO guideline (Figure 2), the proportion of the population exposed to concentrations above the guideline value is as high as 94  99%, with no discernible change over time. O3 concentrations are determined by emissions of its precursors and by meteorological conditions: ozone is formed in sunny conditions with high temperatures. Apart from reductions in anthropogenic emissions of O3 precursors, there have been increases in natural emissions and also in intercontinental transport of O3 and its precursors. Additional factors are also likely to mask the effects of European measures to reduce anthropogenic emissions of O3 precursors, including climate change, emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds from vegetation (difficult to quantify) and fire plumes from forest and other biomass fires (EEA, 2010). Formation of tropospheric ozone from increased concentrations of methane may also contribute to the sustained O3 levels in Europe. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) Between 2000 and 2014, the fraction of the urban population exposed to concentrations in excess of the EU limit value and the identical WHO guideline value gradually decreased to around 10%, with a minimum of 7% in 2014 (Figures 1 and 2). The highest exposure of the urban population to NO2, 31%, occurred in 2003. Enforcement of current legislation has resulted in a reduction in NOx emissions in all sectors. Nevertheless, emissions from transport keep NO2 concentrations high close to main roads. Based on the current trends, explained above, and because of their high and widespread exceedances in urban areas, it is unlikely that air quality standards for these pollutants will be met by 2020, while achieving air quality in line with the WHO guidelines is much further away. Effective air quality policies require action and cooperation on global, European, national and local levels, which must reach across most economic sectors and engage the public. Holistic solutions must be found that involve technological development, structural changes  including the optimisation of infrastructures and urban planning  and behavioural changes. These will be necessary to deliver a level of air quality across the EU that is conducive to the protection of human health (EEA, 2016b). Country-level information Table 2 provides information on the urban population exposed to concentrations of air pollutants above the EU air quality objectives by country for the year 2014. Variations from country to country are not only related to the different pollutant concentrations but also to:  the number of available data series (monitoring stations and/or selected cities), which will influence the total monitored population; the uneven distribution of traffic and background stations in the different countries.   Table 2. Urban population exposed to concentrations of air pollutants above selected air quality standards of the Air Quality Directive, 2014  Note: NA = no available data, for further information please see indicator CSI004. Source: Air pollution country fact sheets (EEA, 2014) updated with 2014 data. The 2014 data aggregated at EU level are also available (EEA, 2016a, 2016c). Outlook beyond 2020 In 2013, the European Commission proposed a Clean Air Policy Package for Europe (EC, 2013), which aims to achieve full compliance with existing air quality legislation by 2020, and to further improve Europes air quality by 2030 and beyond. As a result of this package, it has recently been agreed to revise the 2001 National Emission Ceilings Directive (EU, 2001). The proposed new directive establishes new national emission reduction commitments applicable from 2020 and stricter commitments from 2030 for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds, ammonia and PM2.5. In addition, and as part of the package, a new directive, the Medium Combustion Plant Directive, was approved in November 2015 (EU, 2015). This directive regulates sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust emissions from the combustion of fuels in medium-sized combustion plants (with a rated thermal input of 1and up to 50megawatt). These new commitments, together with the on-going implementation of air quality improvement measures at national, regional and local levels, are expected to improve air quality in Europe. However, the changes in meteorological conditions due to climate change are expected to increase O3 concentrations as a result of expected increased emissions of both specific O3 precursors and emissions from wildfires; these can increase under periods of extensive drought (EEA, 2015). Finally, it is expected that the age group composition of the EU population will continue to shift towards higher numbers of the elderly because of continuing increases in life expectancy (Eurostat, 2016). The overall potential air pollution-related health impact of this change remains uncertain.

The major sources of pollution responsible for faecal bacteria are sewage and water draining from farms and farmland. Such pollution increases during heavy rain and floods, when pollution is washed into rivers and seas, and as a result of overflowing sewerage networks. In addition to good water quality for bathing, clean unpolluted water is required for our ecosystems and to support economic activities such as tourism.    Policy targets and progress    The efforts of the EU to ensure clean and healthy bathing waters started 40 years ago with the original Bathing Water Directive in 1976 (EU, 1976). This was followed by a revised Bathing Water Directive in 2006 (EU, 2006), which updated the measures of the 1976 legislation and simplified its management and surveillance methods. This revised Directive also provides for better and earlier public information about bathing water quality.   The Bathing Water Directive has the aim of increasing the number of bathing waters classified as excellent or good. It also includes a shorter term goal that, by 2015, all waters should have been of at least sufficient quality. In the context of this briefing, and with the aim of linking the objective of the 7th EAP regarding bathing water to the Bathing Water Directive, bathing waters that meet the minimum water quality standards of the Directive (meaning that they were of at least sufficient bathing water quality) are considered to have achieved the high standards called for under the 7th EAP.   Minimum water quality standards were met by 96.1% of all EU bathing waters identified for the 2015 bathing season, which represents an increase of 0.9 percentage points when compared with 2014. In total, 351 EU bathing waters had poor quality in 2015. The proportion of bathing waters with poor quality dropped to 1.6% in 2015. This represents a 0.3 percentage point decrease compared with the previous season (EEA, 2016).   Figure 1 provides an overview of the classification of EU bathing waters into the categories excellent, sufficient and poor, as well as those bathing waters that could not be classified, from 2011 to 2015.             Figure    1. Overall bathing water quality in the EU, 2011 to 2015           The share of bathing waters in the EU with excellent status increased from 78.1% in 2011 to 84.4% in 2015. The proportion of bathing waters with poor quality remained relatively constant (between 1.6% and 2.0%) during the 20112015 period (EEA, 2016).   Overall bathing water quality is thus improving over time. It is encouraging to observe that more and more bathing waters are not only reaching the minimum quality standards set by the Bathing Water Directive but are achieving the highest (excellent) quality standards. The outlook towards the 2020 goal is therefore positive.   Many years of investment in the sewerage system and better wastewater treatment, and the reduction of pollution from farms have led to Europes bathing waters being much cleaner today than they were 40 years ago. The implementation of the Urban Waste-water Treatment Directive (EU, 1991) and a focus on reducing overflow from sewers have been instrumental in reducing pollution and in improving the quality of several low-quality bathing waters (EEA, 2016). However, as figure 1 shows, there are still bathing waters with poor quality. The major sources of pollution responsible for faecal bacteria in bathing waters today are still insufficiently treated or untreated wastewater as a result of system failures, overflows from sewage treatment works or from scattered houses with misconnected drains and poorly located or poorly maintained septic tanks, poorly stored slurry or manure from livestock that washes into streams, and animal (mostly dog) and bird faeces on beaches or crowded beaches with many swimmers.   In wet summers, large amounts of rainwater affect bathing water quality by causing stormwater overflow andthe release of diluted sewage into bathing waters or streams discharging close to beaches. Rainwater also washes animal waste from urban and rural areas into surface water drains and rivers.   Poor water quality can also be caused by misconnected plumbing, whereby foul water such as that from bathrooms or from poorly maintained cesspits and septic tanks enters surface water drains. In years with below average sunshine, water quality is also affected, as the suns ultraviolet rays kill the faecal bacteria found in the water.   In the case of bathing waters with poor quality, it is imperative that the sources of pollution be assessed. The bathing water profiles prepared under the Bathing Water Directive should provide an indication of pollution sources in the catchment area of the bathing water and, together with historical data on rainfall, stream flow and sea currents, should provide information on the upstream sources of pollution to be targeted with measures. Management measures are primarily implemented for those bathing waters that have only sufficient or poor water quality.   The share of bathing waters that meet excellent and good quality standards is likely to increase due to the implementation of the Bathing Water Directive, in particular the effect of measures for poor quality waters.      Country-level information    Figure 2 provides  the results for bathing water quality in 2015 for the EU Member States and two other countries. In general, bathing water quality was of a high standard across the countries.    Figure 2. Bathing water quality for the EU-28, Albania and Switzerland          Note:   The category quality classification not possible includes waters for which there were not enough samples, new bathing waters, bathing waters with changes or bathing waters that had been closed.       All reported bathing water sites in Cyprus, Croatia, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta and Slovenia achieved at least sufficient quality in 2015 (in accordance with the minimum quality standards set by the Bathing Water Directive). Moreover, in excess of 90% of bathing water sites were of excellent quality in eight Member States: Luxembourg (all 11 reported bathing water sites), Cyprus (99.1% of sites), Malta (97.7%), Greece (97.2%), Croatia (94.2%), Italy (90.5%), Germany (90.3%) and Austria (90.2%).   In 2015, there were 383 sites with poor quality bathing water in Europe. Italy (95 bathing water sites or 1.7%), France (95 sites or 2.8%) and Spain (58 sites or 2.6%) were the countries with the highest number of poor bathing water sites.   In some EU Member States, more than 3% of the bathing water sites had poor quality: 4.9% or 31 bathing water sites in the United Kingdom, 4.4% or six sites in Ireland, 3.4% or 24 sites in the Netherlands and 3.2% or three sites in Bulgaria (EEA, 2016).   Outlook beyond 2020   Bathing water quality is not only essential for public health reasons, but clean unpolluted water is also necessary to improve ecosystem resilience. Both can be achieved with more integrated and sustainable water resource management. This would require more robust implementation of the Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000), with River Basin Management Plans developed to improve the poorer quality bathing waters. This would serve to maintain the trend towards consistently high-quality EU bathing waters beyond 2020.   About the indicator   This indicator provides an overview of the bathing water quality in 2015 at more than 21000 bathing waters in the Member States of the EU. It also presents the evolution of bathing water quality from 2011 to 2015. During the bathing season, samples from coastal and inland bathing waters are taken and analysed against two microbiological parameters that may indicate the presence of faecal pollution, namely intestinal enterococci and Escherichia coli(also known as E. coli). After the end of the bathing season, and based on 4 years of data, bathing waters are classified into one of the bathing water quality classes (excellent, good, sufficient or poor).

Sustainable forest management means using forests and forest land in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems (EC, 2013). Forests are essential natural resources hosting a major part of the biodiversity in Europe. Forests also sequester and store carbon, filter water and provide recreational opportunities. This briefing focuses on one aspect of sustainable forest management, namely forest resources, in terms of how the forest utilisation rate affects the forest growing stock. This is used as a measure of the sustainability of the production and use of forest resources and thus the pressure from society and human demand for wood. The utilisation rate  does not reflect  the structures and processes  necessary to maintain biodiversity  and the various forest ecosystem services.   Policy targets and progress     The environmental acquis does not include a specific target addressing sustainable forest management and the EU does not have a common forest policy. Forest sustainability and environmental issues are, nevertheless, embedded in almost all the nature and environmental policies of the EU. The EU Forest Strategy (EC, 2013) aims to coordinate these forest-related policies and to identify the key principles that are needed to ensure the sustainability and multifunctionality of forests in Europe. The strategy will be reviewed in 2018 in order to assess progress in its implementation.   Figure 1 shows that the forest utilisation rate (the ratio between the felling of trees and their annual growth) for the EU has remained relatively constant during the period examined (19902010). On average, the indicator stayed well below 100 %, varying between 60 % and 68 % (Forest Europe, 2015; EEA, 2016).       Figure 1.  Forest utilisation rate, EU         The forest utilisation rate reflects the development of felling as well as the development of annual increment. Both components of the indicator have increased over the period examined (Forest Europe, 2015; EEA, 2016). The demand for wood has been increasing. The forest area in the EU has increased by 13millionha since 1990 (8%). The growing stock has also expanded by 7.4millionm 3  (38%) over the period examined. This increase in growing stock is not only linked to the increase in forest area but also to a number of other reasons across the EU, in particular increased growth rates, low levels of harvesting and increased focus on multifunctional use of forests (ecosystem services from forests).   The expected trend in the EU is an overall increased use of renewable materials and energy as well as the use of forests to provide other ecosystem services. This may mean use of more wood extracted from forests in the EU. Views on the use of wood as renewable biomass are under revision, as the carbon neutrality as well as the resource efficiency of such a use of wood have been questioned. The forest area is expected to remain stable or slightly increase. The growing stock is also expected to stay relatively stable overall, but with regional differences. The expected trend by 2020 may be a slight short- to medium-term increase in the forest utilisation rate indicator to meet increased demands and due to the maturing age structure of forests in Europe. Overall, despite expected increased harvesting of forests, overall forest utilisation is expected to remain less than 100%, so it is considered sustainable.   Country level information     Twenty-two EU countries reported on their forest utilisation rates in the 19902010 period (Forest Europe, 2015). The information underpinning this indicator has not been updated since 2010. In most countries that reported their forest utilisation rate, it remained below 100% for the 19902010 period (Figure 2).   Forest utilisation rates vary widely across the countries and over time, from 25% to more than 100%. Some countries have experienced severe storms in recent decades, which caused large natural losses as well as reductions in increment. This partly explains some of the high utilisation rates of some countries.   It should be stressed that medium- or short-term exceedance of the forest utilisation rate does not necessarily mean that the use of forest resources is unsustainable, as it may reflect harvesting of mature stands or severe storms, for example. From a sustainable forest management perspective, it is the long-term utilisation rate of forests that should stay below 100%.       Figure 2. Forest utilisation rates       Outlook beyond 2020   The outlook for the forest utilisation rate indicator will depend on the demand for biomass as a renewable energy source (UNECE and FAO, 2011). Biomass demand is expected to increase beyond 2020 as part of the EUs efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050 (EC, 2011) and in line with the 7th EAPs 2050 low-carbon economy vision. An increased demand for biomass could increase the demand for wood and with this the utilisation rate unless the annual increment also increases (Berndes et al., 2016).   However, some stakeholders consider that the use of wood directly from the forest for renewable energy may not be resource efficient (Berndes et al., 2016). Forest industries are concerned about whether or not the demand for other forest products and resources can be met. Nevertheless, the majority of wood biomass comes from residue feedstocks in a cascading use of wood. The use of wood is likely to be even more resource efficient if considered as a component of a circular economy. Such resource efficiency might also have an impact on the amount of harvested wood needed to meet societys needs for timber and fuel (Berndes et al., 2016).   Climate change is also a factor that will affect the composition and distribution of current forest resources. Desertification is expected to spread in the south of Europe while forest cover is projected to increase with higher altitudes and latitudes. The resulting impact of climate change on forest utilisation rates has not been explored.   Overall, the expected outlook is an increased forest utilisation rate; however, it is not expected to increase beyond 100% in the long term.          About the indicator        The forest utilisation rate is the ratio between the annual volume felled and the volume of annual growth in the stock of living trees. The ratio is used widely to assess the current and future availability of wood. A ratio below 100% indicates that the growing stock, the timber reserve, is stable. In the long term, the volume felled must not exceed the volume of growth. However, the indicator needs cautious interpretation, as it depends directly on the volume of annual growth. Average annual increment is calculated as the increase in growing stock volume over a year. An increase in growing stock results from maturing forests and an increase in forest area. The correct assessment of the volume of growing stock in Europe should be based on additional information on diameter class distribution, which is not available at European level.   The forest utilisation rate indicator only partly describes sustainable forest management. The indicator indirectly relates to an increased stock of carbon in forest biomass, which is a service provided by forests that mitigates climate change. The indicator has no link to biodiversity or forest condition, as it does not indicate whether or not biodiversity and other services are protected or maintained. Aspects of forest biodiversity are included in the EU protected species briefing ( AIRS_PO1.7, 2016 ), 1  the EU protected habitats briefing ( AIRS_PO1.8, 2016 ) 2  and the Common birds and butterflies briefing ( AIRS_PO1.6, 2016 ). 3,    Indicator   EU indicatorpast trend   Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlookof the EU meetingthe selectedobjective by2020     Forest: growing stock, increment and fellings      Forest management is sustainable  7th EAP (focus solely on forest utilisation)        Since 1990, EU forests overall have been harvested at a lower rate than they have grown (at around 60  70%), indicating sustainable forest management in relation to the forest utilisation rate.

However, the target is some way off for others             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016      Setting the Scene   The 7th EAP states that, by 2020, waste should be safely managed as a resource, landfilling [is] limited to residual (i.e. non-recyclable and non-recoverable waste) and energy recovery [is] limited to non-recyclable materials (EU, 2013). The overarching logic guiding EU policy on waste is the waste hierarchy, which prioritises waste prevention, followed by preparation for reuse, recycling, other recovery and finally disposal, including landfilling as the least desirable option. This briefing presents trends on recycling of municipal waste. An improvement in the proportion of waste that is recycled indicates that waste management is moving up the waste hierarchy. Recycling allows the generation of more value from resources and creates jobs. It can also reduce the demand for raw materials and environmental impacts associated with meeting this demand ( AIRS_PO2.1, 2016 ). 1     Policy targets and progress    The EU has introduced multiple waste policies and targets since the 1990s. These include strategies, such as the Thematic Strategy on the Prevention and Recycling of Waste (EU, 2005),and framework legislation such as the Waste Framework Directive (EU, 2008). The Waste Framework Directive sets a target for 50% of at least four fractions (i.e. paper, glass, metals, plastics) of municipal waste to be prepared for reuse or recycled by 2020 in EU Member States. Countries can choose from four alternative calculation methods to measure progress towards the target.   In December 2015, the European Commission published Closing the loop  An EU action plan for the circular economy (EC, 2015), also known as the Circular Economy Package. The package sets out a large number of initiatives, and proposes new targets for municipal waste of 60% recycling and preparing for reuse by 2025 and 65% by 2030. These are based on only one calculation method (the one used in Figure 2 of this briefing) with the option of derogations on the timescale for some countries.   As can be seen in Figure 1, for the EU-28 the overall rate of recycling (material recycling, composting and digestion) increased from 30% in 2004 to 43% in 2014. This improvement is a combination of a reduction in the amount of municipal waste generated and an increase in the total quantity undergoing material recycling, composting and digestion. This increase is viewed as one of the success stories of environmental policy in Europe so far.    Figure 1. Proportion of municipal waste treated by different methods, EU         Figure 1 shows the trend in municipal waste recycling in the context of other municipal waste treatment methods. It is apparent that, as a whole, the EU is moving away from landfilling but that incineration is also growing, with a 44% increase between 2004 and 2014, compared with a 37% increase for recycling (including composting and digestion).   Country level information   Despite high (and sustained) levels of municipal waste recycling in some countries and strong improvement in many others, the low rates of recycling and slow progress made in some countries suggest that not everycountrywillachievethe Waste Framework Directive targetby2020.      Figure 2. Municipal waste recycling rate (including composting and digestion) by country          EEA countries achieved an average total recycling rate of 34% in 2014, compared with 24% in 2004. In the EU-27, it increased from 31% to 44% over the same period. There were large differences in performance among those countries with the highest and lowest recycling rates. Germany, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden recycled at least half of their municipal waste in 2014. The highest increase in recycling rates between 2004 and 2014 occurred in Lithuania, Iceland, Poland, Italy, Cyprus, the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic (increases of 2029 percentage points). Overall, in 15 out of 32 countries, the increase in recycling rates was at least 10 percentage points over this period.However, in six countries the proportion of recycled municipal waste barely changed (Spain, Belgium, Latvia, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Malta and Switzerland (increases of fewer than 5 percentage points) and in three countries (Finland, Austria and Turkey) it decreased.    The recycling rates shown in Figure 2 cannot be used to assess EU Member States progress against the target of 50% of waste to be prepared for reuse and recycling set by the Waste Framework Directive, because Member States can choose between four different methods to calculate compliance with the target. Figure 2 shows recycling rates calculated following the most demanding method, i.e. method 4.   Progress in enhancing recycling rates is primarily due to trends in the recycling of materials, with biowaste recycling performing less well. Nineteen countries achieved fairly substantial increases in their material recycling rates, but there was comparatively little change in national biowaste recycling rates (EEA, 2013).   There is a clear link between increasing recycling rates and declining rates of landfilling. In countries with high municipal waste recycling rates, landfilling is declining much faster than recycling is growing, as waste management strategies usually move from landfilling towards a combination of recycling and incineration, and in some cases also mechanicalbiological treatment (MBT) (EEA, 2013).   Almost without exception, the countries that are performing better in terms of recycling have a wider range of measures and instruments in place than the poorer performing countries (EEA, 2013). Measures have included landfill bans on biodegradable waste or non-pre-treated municipal waste; mandatory separate collection of municipal waste types, especially biowastes; and economic instruments such as landfill and incineration taxes and waste collection fees that strongly encourage recycling. Producer responsibility, binding recycling targets and obligations to make separate collections have certainly also played a role. Although the key drivers behind better municipal waste management are clearly EU and national policies and targets, regional and local policies within countries also play a significant role (EEA, 2015).   Outlook beyond 2020   The 7th EAP describes a number of steps that are required to achieve its objective of waste being managed as a resource.The Circular Economy Package (EC, 2015), includes a number of proposed targets and measures beyond 2020, which can move the EU towards this vision:     a common EU target of preparing 65% of municipal waste for reuse and recycling by 2030;   a common EU target of preparing 75% of packaging waste for reuse and recycling by 2030;   a binding landfill target to reduce landfill to a maximum of 10% of municipal waste by 2030;   a ban on landfilling of separately collected waste;   the promotion of economic instruments to discourage landfilling ;   simplified and improved definitions and harmonised calculation methods for recycling rates throughout the EU;   concrete measures to promote reuse and stimulate industrial symbiosis  turning one industrys by-product into anothers raw material;   economic incentives for producers to put greener products on the market and support recovery and recycling schemes (e.g. for packaging, batteries, electrical and electronicequipment and vehicles).     The success of these targets and measures will be key to the medium- to long-term prospects for achieving an innovative circular economy in which nothing is wasted, as envisaged by the 7th EAP.   About the indicator   This briefing focuses on the recycling of municipal waste. Despite the fact that it represents only around 7  10% of total waste generation in the EU, municipal waste is very visible and its prevention has the potential to reduce environmental impact, not only in the consumption and waste phases but also over the whole life cycle of the products consumed. Municipal waste consists to a large extent of waste generated by households, but it may also include similar wastes generated by small businesses and public institutions that are also collected by municipalities.   Recycling of waste is defined as any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances, whether for the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material (e.g. by composting or digesting) but does not include energy recovery and reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations (Eurostat, 2015).   The recycling rate is calculated as the percentage of municipal waste generated that is subsequently recycled (including composting and digesting). There are limitations in the comparability of data between countries and over time. There are also variations in what countries classify as municipal waste and, in some cases, these definitions have changed over time. In addition, there is also variation in the calculation method, depending on whether or not the weight of material collected but discarded during the recycling process is included.   Finally, the indicator shows the recycling rate of municipal waste calculated using a consistent method, although Member States can choose between four different methods to monitorrecyclingrates in order to meet the target of 50% of waste to be prepared for reuse and recycling (EEA, 2015).,    Indicator   Indicator past trend   Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020     Recycling of municipal waste   EU    EEA    50 % of selected materials in household and similar waste to be recycled by each EU Member State  Waste Framework Directive         The amount of municipal waste being recycled has been steadily increasing.

Finally, the indicator shows the recycling rate of municipal waste calculated using a consistent method, although Member States can choose between four different methods to monitorrecyclingrates in order to meet the target of 50% of waste to be prepared for reuse and recycling (EEA, 2015)."

Under the Regulation on the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, chemicals are classified as hazardous on the basis of properties that generate physical, environmental and health hazards (EU, 2008). While the production and subsequent use of chemicals provides benefits to society, exposure to the hazardous chemicals emitted along the chemical life cycle generates significant risks to health and ecosystems. Human exposure to chemicals is associated with a number of disease outcomes (Prss-Ustn et al., 2011), while chemical pollution degrades air and water quality and can impact negatively on ecosystem services. Hazardous chemicals have been detected in human populations and linked to environmental and dietary exposures (Smolders et al., 2015). Emerging concerns include the health impacts of chemical mixtures, endocrine-disrupting substances and nanomaterials (EEA and JRC, 2013).   Policy targets and progress   The Regulation on the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH) (EU, 2006) aims to improve the protection of human health and the environment from the risks posed by chemicals. REACH also calls for the progressive substitution of the most hazardous chemicals, when suitable alternatives have been identified.   Eurostat developed a set of indicators to monitor progress towards two major goals of REACH: to improve the quality of data for chemical risk assessment, and to reduce the risks posed by chemicals to humans and the environment (Eurostat, 2009). An analysis using these indicators suggests that REACH implementation resulted in better risk control from 2007 to 2011 (Eurostat, 2012).   In making the link between the production of chemicals that are hazardous to human health and resulting risks to human health, the assumption is that reduced production volumes will equate to a reduction in the overall risk profile of chemicals incorporated into products and sold in the EU. The production of chemicals that are hazardous to health in the EU followed a gradual downward trend from 2005 to 2014, with an overall decline of 28 million tonnes in 2014, representing a 12 % drop from 2005 production levels. Within this period, production fell sharply during the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009, and rebounded in 2010, to then decline again more gradually.   Figure 1 provides an overview of the production of chemicals that are hazardous to health by hazard class in the EU from 2005 to 2014, as well as showing total chemical production. The proportion of total EU chemical production that comprises chemicals that are hazardous to human health also followed a gradual downward trend over the 10 years, declining from 66 % in 2005 to 63 % in 2014. The proportion of chemicals that are carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic for reproduction in total EU-28 chemical production declined from 11 % in 2005 to 10 % in 2014. Such chemicals are considered to pose the most significant risks to human health. These trends may be indicative of a shift in production towards less hazardous chemicals, driven by substitution.    Figure 1. Production of chemicals, by hazard class in the EU-28         However, production volumes for chemicals that are hazardous to health do not provide direct insight into risks, since production is not synonymous with exposure. On the one hand, some chemicals are handled in closed systems, or as intermediate goods in controlled supply chains, implying that no or limited exposure takes place (Eurostat, 2014). On the other hand, it is also possible that reductions in EU production of chemicals that are hazardous to health are being offset by increased imports of products that contain such chemicals, potentially leading to exposures along the product life cycle. In addition, the EU is a net importer of chemicals and in 2015 the volume of chemicals hazardous to health that was consumed in the EU was 7 % higher than the volume produced. EU chemical consumption also saw a downward trend from 2005 to 2014. However, while EU production of chemicals that are hazardous to health declined by 12 % between 2005 and 2014, consumption declined by only 9 % (Eurostat, 2016a).   These factors confound the use of EU production volumes of chemicals that are hazardous to health as a proxy for exposure. It is therefore not possible to accurately report progress towards the goal of minimising risks to the environment and health on the basis of this indicator.   Additional concerns focus on the health impacts of chemicals that affect the human hormone system (known as endocrine disruptors), risks to childrens health, nanomaterials and chemical combination effects. The 7th EAP calls for these aspects to be effectively addressed in EU legislation by 2020. The indicator on the production of chemicals that are hazardous to health does not provide specific insight on these concerns.   Outlook beyond 2020   Chemical risk is an area characterised by uncertainties regarding exposure levels, as well as associations between exposure and health outcomes and the causal mechanisms involved. New initiatives to generate data on the exposure of the European population to chemicals using human biomonitoring should serve to improve the knowledge base. This would provide a valuable evidence base for strengthening the protection of human health from chemical risks.   The 7th EAP calls for the development of an EU strategy for a non-toxic environment by 2018, to address the concerns listed above, as well as exposure to chemicals in products, including imported products, with a view to promoting non-toxic material cycles and reducing indoor exposure to harmful substances. This strategy is expected to set a framework for actions to minimise chemical risks beyond 2020.   Current efforts to promote a circular economy also have implications for chemicals in products. The reuse or recycling of products that are contaminated with hazardous chemicals may lead to unforeseen exposures of both humans and the environment. Further research is required to identify those material flows that are likely to be contaminated with hazardous chemicals and to understand the potential exposures that might arise from recycling these materials. Such knowledge might then inform decisions on whether to prioritise increasing the quantity of materials channelled for recycling, or to separate out contaminated materials for management as hazardous waste, so guaranteeing the quality of recycled materials.   At the United Nations level, in 2002, participants at the World Summit of Sustainable Development, including the EU and its Member States, made a commitment to the sound management of chemicals throughout their life cycle, aiming to achieve, by 2020, that chemicals are used and produced in ways that lead to the minimization of significant adverse effects on human health and the environment (UN, 2002). This goal was reaffirmed at Rio+20 (UN, 2012), with the 7th EAP explicitly calling for action to attain this goal at EU level. In addition, the Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2015) set a global agenda until 2030 and define the risks from chemicals under several topics, including goals to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, and to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.   About the indicator   The indicator tracks the production of industrial chemicals that are hazardous to human health. It is restricted to chemicals under five toxicity classes, including, and beginning with the most dangerous: chemicals that are carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductive toxicants; chemicals suspected to be carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductive toxicants as well as skin and respiratory sensitisers (collectively called chronic toxic chemicals); very toxic chemicals; toxic chemicals; and harmful chemicals (Eurostat, 2016b). Collectively these classes comprise those chemicals deemed hazardous to health. These classes of chemicals exhibit properties that impact on human health, and are derived from the hazard statements described under the Regulation on the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (EU, 2008).   The scope of the indicator is limited, since it does not cover all possible impacts on human health, nor does it cover chemicals that impact only on the environment. Taking the production of chemicals that are hazardous to health as an imperfect proxy for exposure, a fall in production may imply a reduction in exposure. However, there are a number of limitations when extrapolating exposure from production. First, exposure depends upon the uses to which synthesised chemicals are put and on safety measures in place to control emissions along the chemical life cycle, including production, use in products, waste and any recycling and/or reuse stages. Second, total production in the EU does not fully reflect total volume of chemicals incorporated into products and sold on the EU market, since it does not account for imports of chemicals and products containing chemicals.,    Indicator   EU indicator past trend     Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020      Production of chemicals, by hazard class       Risks for the environment and health associated with the use of hazardous substances, including chemicals in products, are assessed and minimised  7th EAP        While the production of chemicals that are hazardous to health has declined over the years, it is not possible to equate this to a reduction in the risks to environment and health and the outlook towards 2020 is therefore unclear     For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the EEA Environmental indicator report 2016 Setting the Scene The 7th EAP (EU, 2013) includes a number of chemical-related goals, one of which is that health and environmental risks associated with the use of hazardous substances, including chemicals in products, are assessed and minimised by 2020.

This briefing addresses only surface waters. Surface waters are the majority of the volume of EU waters and are important habitats, providing key support to society and the economy throughout Europe, while clean, unpolluted waters are essential for our ecosystems. Surface waters have traditionally been the disposal route for human, agricultural and industrial waste, which has damaged their water quality. They have also been altered (by dams, canalisation etc.) to facilitate agriculture and urbanisation, to produce energy and to protect against flooding, all of which can result in damage to their hydromorphology.   Policy targets and progress   The main aim of EU water policy is to ensure that a sufficient quantity of good quality water is available for peoples needs and the environment. The Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000) stipulates that EU Member States should aim to achieve good status in all bodies of surface water and groundwater by 2015 unless there are grounds for exemption. The 7th EAP mirrored this objective and called for all European water bodies to reach good status by 2020.   During the last 30 years, significant progress has been made in reducing the pollution in numerous European water bodies, in particular thanks to improved wastewater treatment. Water quality in Europe has therefore improved significantly in recent decades, and the effects of pollutants have decreased (EEA 2015a, 2015b). Pollution from agriculture (in particular nitrogen losses from agricultural land) and urban and industrial wastewater nevertheless remain significant. For decades, sometimes centuries, humans have altered European surface waters (straightening and canalisation, disconnection of flood plains, land reclamation, dams, weirs, bank reinforcements, etc.) to facilitate agriculture and urbanisation, produce energy and protect against flooding. These activities have resulted in damage to the morphology and hydrology of the water bodies, i.e. to their hydromorphology.   Based on the first river basin management plans reported in 2008, more than half of the surface water bodies in Europe are in less than good ecological status or potential, and will need mitigation and/or restoration measures to meet the Water Framework Directive  objective (Figure1).  Rivers and transitional waters are on average in a worse condition than lakes and coastal waters. Concerns about the ecological status of surface water bodies are most pronounced for central and north-western Europe, in areas with intensive agricultural practices and high population densities. The status of coastal and transitional waters in the Black Sea and greater North Sea regions is also of concern.      Figure 1.  Ecological status or potential of classified rivers, lakes, coastal and transitional waters, EU          In 2009, 43% of surface water bodies were in good or high ecological status and, in 2015, 53% of water bodies were expected to reach good ecological status. This is far from meeting the objective of good ecological status and only constitutes a modest improvement in ecological status. Given this modest improvement and despite ongoing efforts, it is unlikely that the objective of achieving good status of waters will be met.    Country level information    As Figure2 illustrates, there are differences betweenriver basin districts with regard to the percentage of their water bodies that have good ecological status. Surface water bodies in north-western Europe have the lowest status and/or greatest potential for improvement. In Belgium (Flanders), northern Germany and the Netherlands, more than 90% of surface waters are reported to be in less than good(i.e. moderate, poor or bad) ecologicalstatus or potential.Other problem areas are in the Czech Republic, southern England, northern France, southern Germany, Hungary and Poland, as well as several individual river basin districts in other EU Member States, where 7090% of freshwater bodies (lakes and rivers) are reported to be in less than good status or potential. The status of coastal and transitional waters, in the Black Sea and greater North Sea regions is also of great concern.   Figure 2.  Percentage of classified surface water bodies in different river basin districtsholding less than good ecological status or potential, for rivers and lakes (top panel) and for coastal and transitional waters (bottom panel)            Note: Switzerland data sets on river and lake water quality reported in the framework of EEA priority data flows are not compatible with the EU Water Framework Directive assessments and are not included above.  Source:  WISE WFD Database .            Outlook beyond 2020   Further efforts will be required beyond 2020 to achieve a good status for all surface waters. To achieve good status, Member States will have to address the pressures affecting water bodies. Pollution will be one pressure (e.g. run-off from agriculture, wastewater from households and industry); morphological changes, overabstraction and hydrological changes affecting water flow would also play a role. Full implementation of the Water Framework Directive throughout all sectors will be needed to reduce these pressures, and in individual river basins it will be necessary to commit users from each sector (e.g. the agriculture sector) to focusing on delivering healthy water bodies with good status.    About the indicator    Achieving good status involves meeting certain standards for the ecology, chemistry, morphology and quantity of waters. In general terms, good status means that water shows only a slight change from what would normally be expected under undisturbed conditions (i.e. with a low human impact). This indicator is defined as the number of surface water bodies reaching at least good ecological status or good ecological potential. Ecological status and potential is a criterion for the quality of the structure and functioning of surface water ecosystems. More specifically, a surface water body has reached good ecological status when the values of the biological quality elements for the surface water body type show low levels of distortion resulting from human activity, but deviate only slightly from those normally associated with the surface water body type under undisturbed conditions (EU, 2000).   The ecological status is used here as a proxy for the overall status of waters. This is because the ecological status is influenced by water quality (e.g. pollution levels of all types) as well as by the amount of available water. In addition, surface waters constitute the majority of EU waters. Water quantity issues are addressed in the Freshwater use briefing ( AIRS_PO2.4, 2016 ), 1  which covers both surface and groundwaters.   The indicator covers only the current status of surface waters and not past trends. New data will become available in 2017 and the next version of the indicator will include trends.,    Indicator   EU indicator past trend    Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020     Status in surface waters   NA(1)   Achieve good status of transitional and coastal waters and freshwaters  Water Framework Directive        Considering the large proportion of surface waters failing to meet 'good' ecological status, it is unlikely that the objective of achieving good status of waters will be met by 2020     For the further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the EEA Environmental indicator report 2016 Setting the Scene One of the goals of the 7th EAP (EU, 2013) is that the impact of pressures on transitional, coastal and freshwaters (including surface and groundwaters) should be significantly reduced to achieve,maintain or enhance good status, as defined by the Water Framework Directive.

However, pesticides applied to crops enter soil and surface waters via leaching and run-off and can enter groundwater, negatively affecting non-target species in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This canimpact on habitat function and contribute to biodiversity loss, as well asreducing the quality of ecosystem services, such as insect-mediated pollination, soil formation and composition and the provision of clean drinking water. Pesticide residues in food can also pose a risk for human health, while residues in animal feed pose risks to animal health and can enter the food chain. Particular concerns have been raised regarding the health impacts of human exposure to pesticides with endocrine-disrupting properties (Mnif et al., 2011) and the associated costs to human health (Trasande et al., 2015). In June 2016, the European Commission presented scientific criteria to identify endocrine disruptors in plant protection products and in biocides (EC, 2016), with the aim of protecting human health and the environment. The 7 th  EAP (EU, 2013a) sets the objective that by 2020 the use of plant protection products does not have any harmful effects on human health or unacceptable influence on the environment, and that such products are used sustainably.    Policy targets and progress    Adopted in 2009, the Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides (EU, 2009a) aims to reduce impacts on human health and the environment. To this end, Member States established National Action Plans, including quantitative objectives, targets, measures and timetables. These plans should promote low pesticide input pest management and non-chemical methods, including both integrated pest management and organic farming. With the aim of protecting the aquatic environment and drinking water, Member States should adopt measures to minimise off-site pollution from spray drift, drain-flow and run-off. These include establishing buffer zones to separate the usage or storage of pesticides from rivers, lakes and waterways, in particular those used for drinking water abstraction. The first National Action Plans were communicated to the Commission in 2012 and are to be reviewed by the Member States at least every 5 years. Member States are to take all necessary means to achieve the targets set out in the National Action Plans.   Under the Regulation on plant protection products (EU, 2009b), the Commission is required to identify active substances with certain properties as candidates for substitution. Member States will then evaluate whether or not these active substances might be replaced by other pesticides that are less harmful. While this process is currently in the early stages of implementation, over time it should promote the use of less harmful pesticides and provide incentives to industry to develop pesticides with less hazardous properties.   Water quality legislation also generates obligations to control environmental exposure to pesticides. The contamination of surface waters with pesticides is managed under the Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000), which requires upstream controls to reduce emissions, discharges and losses of those pesticides that have been identified as priority substances or priority hazardous substances under the Priority Substances Directive (EU, 2013b). The Drinking Water Directive (EU, 1998) stipulates a maximum concentration of 0.1g/l for any single pesticide and its relevant metabolites (to a maximum of 0.5g/l for total pesticides) in potable water. Thresholds are also applied for pesticide residues in food and feed (EU, 2005), and as undesirable substances in animal feed (EU, 2002).   As shown by Figure1, total sales of pesticidesacross the EU as a whole declined from 2011 to 2013,before increasing in 2014 to just under 400 000 tonnes, a level 4% above that seen in2011. This suggests that EU demand for pesticides has remained relatively stable, despite implementation of the National Action Plans under the Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.    Figure 1. Total EU pesticides sales         However, this indicator tells us little about the risks associated with pesticide use. It is not possible to directly equate the quantity of pesticides sold with resulting risks to human health and the environment. The risks of pesticide use depend on both the hazard characteristics of the active substances included in the pesticide product and on application methods and use patterns. The climate, landscape, habitat and soil characteristics of the receiving ecosystem, as well as proximity to water bodies, influence how pesticides disperse in the environment. These various aspects strongly influence risk to environment and health, and are not accounted for by measuring the volumes sold on the market.   With the aim of enabling an assessment of EU-level progress in reducing the risks and adverse effects of pesticides on human health and the environment, the Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides foresees the establishment of harmonised risk indicators. Development of these indicators is dependent on access to data on pesticide use. The Regulation on pesticide statistics (EU, 2009c) is expected to deliver data in 2016 on the agricultural use of pesticides by crop for 5-year periods, which should facilitate a better understanding of the risks to the environment and human health.   Monitoring data on pesticides in the European environment and in the human population would provide a robust basis for assessing exposure that, in combination with (eco)toxicity data, could enhance our understanding of current risks to human health and the environment. Under theWater Framework Directive, Member States have established a comprehensivenetwork of monitoring stations through which to investigate thepresence of priority substances and priority hazardous substances in surface waters. Several of these substances are pesticides, with monitoring data due to be reported to the EEA in 2016. With regard to human exposure, efforts are ongoing at European level to establish a European Human Biomonitoring Initiative todeliver data on the exposure of the European population to chemicals, including pesticides. Theseactivities should serve to support a more robust assessment of the risks from pesticides to humanhealth and the environment.   The selected indicator does notenable an evaluation of progress towards the 2020 objective. Rather it serves to highlight current gaps in the knowledge base for assessing progress towardsthis objective.   Country level data   In 2014, the countries in which the highest quantities of pesticides were sold were Spain, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, together making up 73 % of the EU-28s pesticide sales. In terms of trends in the sales of pesticides at Member State level, 2011 to 2014 saw reductions in the volumes sold in 13 Member States, with significant reductions in Denmark (63% reduction), Ireland (26% reduction), Malta (16% reduction), Greece (15% reduction) and Romania (12% reduction). Meanwhile, pesticide sales increased in 11 countries, with significant increases in Estonia (30% increase), Latvia (32% increase) and France (23% increase). Data was not available to assess trends in four Member States. In Norway, pesticide sales increased by 4 % from 2011 to 2014, while in Switzerland sales remained stable (Eurostat, 2016a).   Figure2 shows the quantities of pesticides sold on the market against the land area that was utilised for agricultural production in 2013 by each Member State. In 2013, Bulgaria had the smallest proportion of pesticide sales per hectare of utilised agricultural area, with 0.22kg/ha. Ireland, Estonia, Finland, Denmark, Latvia, Romania, Greece, Sweden and Lithuania all had quantities of sold pesticides under 1kilogram per ha of utilised agricultural area. Slovenia, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Cyprus and Malta all had quantities of pesticides sold per hectare above 2kg/ha. Malta recorded the highest quantity of pesticides sold per hectare, with a value of 9.97kg/ha (Eurostat, 2016b).    Figure 2. Pesticide sales per utilised agricultural area, by country for 2013         Outlook beyond 2020   There are a number of conflicting trends expected to influence future demand for pesticides. The implementation of National Action Plans by Member States should foster the sustainable use of pesticides in the long term,as well aspromoting integrated pest management and organic farming. The EU has seen an upward trend in organic farming, with the total organic area in the EU ( i.e. the area fully converted to organic production and the area under conversion)    having increased by 21 % from 2010 to 2015 to cover 11.1 million hectares (Eurostat, 2016d). While a continuation of this trend in future years may serve to reduce overall EU demand for pesticides, there is a significant variation in the proportion of organic farming in agricultural production among different EU Member States. On the other hand, global food production will need to increase in order to feed a population estimated to rise above 9.6 billion by 2050 (EEA, 2015). The associated increase in demandmay drive furtherintensification of agricultural production and lead to an increased demand for agrochemicals.   In terms of technological developments, precision agriculture offers the potential to optimise the relationship between productivity and inputs, thereby increasing the sustainability of agricultural production. The approach employs sensors and global navigation satellite systems to manage spatial and temporal variability in the demand for agricultural inputs. In the case of pesticides, this involves ensuring that application rates are precisely tailored to needs, for example by responding to variability in the scale and density of crops or the presence of natural enemies of insect pests. Further research is required to fully understand the environmental benefits of precision agriculture and to promote its uptake, where relevant (JRC, 2015).   About the indicator   The indicator provides data on the volumes of sales of the active substances contained in pesticides. Sales data for active substances are reported by the Member States to Eurostat under the Regulation on pesticide statistics (EU, 2009c). This Regulation covers pesticides, or plant protection products, defined as products consisting of or containing active substances, safeners or synergists, and intended for one of the following uses:     protecting plants or plant products against all harmful organisms or preventing the action of such organisms, unless the main purpose of these products is considered to be for reasons of hygiene rather than for the protection of plants or plant products;   influencing the life processes of plants, such as substances influencing their growth, other than as a nutrient; preserving plant products, in so far as such substances or products are not subject to special European Community provisions on preservatives;   destroying undesired plants or parts of plants, except algae, unless the products are applied on soil or water to protect plants; or   checking or preventing undesired growth of plants, except algae.     An active substance is a substance or micro-organism, including viruses, that has general or specific action against harmful organisms or on plants, parts of plants or plant products. This indicator does notaddress biocides.   Pesticide sales data can only provide a proxy for the actual use of pesticides, as they do not account for storage for later use, any wastage or the transport of pesticide products across borders. Data on the actual application of pesticides by crop and by region would allow improved understanding of the risks to human health and the environment.,    Indicator   EU indicator past trend    Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020     Total sales of pesticides      The use of plant protection products does not have any harmful effects on human health or unacceptable influence on the environment, and such products are used sustainably  7th EAP        The selected indicator does not afford for an evaluation of progress towards the 2020 objective.

Preserving and restoring the EUs protected habitats is a key element in achieving this. An EU-wide network of protected habitats in good conservation status is crucial, not only for the intrinsic value of these habitats and the species that depend on them, but also because protecting them is important to ensure provision of a wide range of ecosystem servicesnatural flood protection, air and water quality regulation, pollination, recreation, etc.for the benefit of EU citizens.    Policy targets and progress    In line with the 7th EAP objective, the overall aim of the Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 (EC, 2011) is to halt loss of biodiversity and degradation of ecosystem services in the EU by 2020. The Habitats Directive (EU, 1992) aims to ensure that the habitats of European interest are in a good status. Target 1 of the Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 sets out the specific goal that, by 2020, 100% more habitatassessments under the Habitats Directive show a favourable or improved conservation status.In practice this means that, by 2020, 34% of habitats assessments should have either reached a favourable conservation status or shown a significant improvement in their status.   Overall results for conservation status and trends reported under the Habitats Directive for the 20072012period show that only 16.4% of habitat assessmentshave a favourable conservation status, while 77% are unfavourable. Of the unfavourable assessments, only 4.4% have improving trends, 33% are stable and 30% show ongoing deterioration. Consequently, only around 21% of habitat assessments have reached the target condition, which is still some way short of the 2020 targetof 34% (EC, 2015; EEA, 2015a). For habitats associated with agricultural ecosystems (grassland and cropland), 39% of assessments showed deterioration compared with the previous reporting period (EC, 2015).   Looking at conservation status by main habitat group (see Figure1), favourable conservation status is lowest for dune habitats and highest for rocky habitats (mostly in high mountain areas and away from human activities). For conservation status trends, unfavourable and deteriorating is particularly high for bogs, mires and fens, but also for grasslands. Marine habitats assessments also give rise for concern: only 9% were in a favourable conservation status, 66% were considered to be in unfavourable status and 25% were categorised as having unknown status. However, it should be noted that the number of marine habitats covered under this Directive is very low.   Figure 1. Conservation status and trends of habitats assessed under the Habitats Directive (2007-2012), EU        Overall, the conservation status of EU protected habitats has not improved, and habitats of European interestshow a worse conservation status and trend than species of European interest.   Several factors contribute to this. Firstly, habitat restoration can often take a long time to get from the initial implementation of measures to the achievement of tangible improvement in conservation status. A key component in the implementation of the Habitats and Birds Directives is the Natura 2000 network, an EU-wide network of nature conservation areas. The terrestrial Natura 2000 network designation is now considered largely complete (18% of EU land). The coverage of protected marine areas has increased to 6% but still requires substantial additional effort. The effective management and restoration of Natura 2000 sites is central to improving the conservation status of habitats. In 2012, however, only 58% of Natura 2000 sites had management plans, or had such plans in development (EEA, 2015a). Similarly, other measures that can benefit conservation status are still being implemented across the EU, e.g. policy measures anticipated under the Birds and Habitats Directives, the Common Agricultural Policy reform and the increased integration of biodiversity objectives in the EUs financial instruments.   Finally, EU terrestrial habitats continue to be subject to many pressures, including agricultural practices such as modification of cultivation techniques, overgrazing, abandonment of pastoral systems, and the use of fertilisers and pesticides, as well as human-induced modifications of natural conditions (mostly related to hydrological changes). For marine habitats, the main reported pressure and threat is pollution. Many of these threats and pressures arise from a wide range of sectors and policies (including agriculture, fisheries, forestry and transport) and are expected to be ongoing. Consequently, the fate of European biodiversity is closely intertwined with developments in these areas. The adequate integration of biodiversity considerations into certain economic sectors and regional policies remains critical, therefore, in attempting to reduce the pressures on biodiversity (EEA, 2015b).   Given the limited progress in improving the conservation status of EU protected habitats and the ongoing cumulative pressures on these habitats, it is very unlikely that the 2020 target for conservation status of habitats will be met.   Country level information   At the level of EU Member States, the majority of assessments indicate a low proportion of habitats in a favourable condition, with notable exceptionsCyprus, Estonia, Malta, Romania and Sloveniareporting more than 40% of habitat assessments as favourable. The countries reporting the most habitat assessments with unfavourable status are all in northern EuropeBelgium, Denmark, the Netherlands andthe United Kingdom (see Figure2). This pattern can probably be attributed mainly to the relatively intensive agriculture practised in these Member States. As for the conservation status trends within the reporting period (20072012), there are overall more declining than improving habitat assessments.   Figure 2. Conservation status and trends of habitats assessed under the Habitats Directive (2007-2012), by country        Outlook beyond 2020   Achieving favourable conservation status for EU protected habitats in the longer term is challenging. This is due to the expected continuation of many environmental pressures, with some pressures such as climate change set to increase, and to the time lag between the implementation of restoration measures and the desired outcomes in terms of habitat conservation status. Marine habitats are especially challenging because of their currently poor status, and a substantial increase in the network of protected marine areas still needs to be implemented.    About the indicator    The indicator covers habitats that are considered to be of European interest (listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive). The Habitats Directive protects 233 rare and characteristic natural and semi-natural habitat types (e.g. types of grasslands, wetlands, dunes) within the territory of the EU. Their conservation status is assessed by all EU Member States every 6 years, and these assessments and other data from the Member States are subsequently used to make EU-level assessments. There have been two reporting rounds so far (20002006 and 20072012).   The indicator measures conservation status for habitat types in terms offavourable, unfavourableinadequate, unfavourablebad and unknown. Furthermore, the indicator measures trends for assessments with unfavourable conservation status: unfavourable improving, unfavourablestable, unfavourabledeteriorating, unfavourableunknown. The assessments are based on four parameters: (1) trends and status of range; (2) trends and status of the area; (3)structure and function including typical species; and(4)future prospects.,    Indicator   EU indicator past trend    Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020     Habitats of European interest      Ensure that 34 % of habitat assessments under the Habitats Directive are in a favourable or improved conservation status  EU Biodiversity Strategy         The EU has shown limited progress in improving the conservation status of EU protected habitats and the pressures on these habitats remain.

Conservation status and trends of habitats assessed under the Habitats Directive (2007-2012), EU  Overall, the conservation status of EU protected habitats has not improved, and habitats of European interestshow a worse conservation status and trend than species of European interest. Several factors contribute to this. Firstly, habitat restoration can often take a long time to get from the initial implementation of measures to the achievement of tangible improvement in conservation status. A key component in the implementation of the Habitats and Birds Directives is the Natura 2000 network, an EU-wide network of nature conservation areas. The terrestrial Natura 2000 network designation is now considered largely complete (18% of EU land). The coverage of protected marine areas has increased to 6% but still requires substantial additional effort. The effective management and restoration of Natura 2000 sites is central to improving the conservation status of habitats. In 2012, however, only 58% of Natura 2000 sites had management plans, or had such plans in development (EEA, 2015a). Similarly, other measures that can benefit conservation status are still being implemented across the EU, e.g. policy measures anticipated under the Birds and Habitats Directives, the Common Agricultural Policy reform and the increased integration of biodiversity objectives in the EUs financial instruments. Finally, EU terrestrial habitats continue to be subject to many pressures, including agricultural practices such as modification of cultivation techniques, overgrazing, abandonment of pastoral systems, and the use of fertilisers and pesticides, as well as human-induced modifications of natural conditions (mostly related to hydrological changes). For marine habitats, the main reported pressure and threat is pollution. Many of these threats and pressures arise from a wide range of sectors and policies (including agriculture, fisheries, forestry and transport) and are expected to be ongoing. Consequently, the fate of European biodiversity is closely intertwined with developments in these areas. The adequate integration of biodiversity considerations into certain economic sectors and regional policies remains critical, therefore, in attempting to reduce the pressures on biodiversity (EEA, 2015b). Given the limited progress in improving the conservation status of EU protected habitats and the ongoing cumulative pressures on these habitats, it is very unlikely that the 2020 target for conservation status of habitats will be met. Country level information At the level of EU Member States, the majority of assessments indicate a low proportion of habitats in a favourable condition, with notable exceptionsCyprus, Estonia, Malta, Romania and Sloveniareporting more than 40% of habitat assessments as favourable. The countries reporting the most habitat assessments with unfavourable status are all in northern EuropeBelgium, Denmark, the Netherlands andthe United Kingdom (see Figure2). This pattern can probably be attributed mainly to the relatively intensive agriculture practised in these Member States. As for the conservation status trends within the reporting period (20072012), there are overall more declining than improving habitat assessments. Figure 2. Conservation status and trends of habitats assessed under the Habitats Directive (2007-2012), by country  Outlook beyond 2020 Achieving favourable conservation status for EU protected habitats in the longer term is challenging. This is due to the expected continuation of many environmental pressures, with some pressures such as climate change set to increase, and to the time lag between the implementation of restoration measures and the desired outcomes in terms of habitat conservation status. Marine habitats are especially challenging because of their currently poor status, and a substantial increase in the network of protected marine areas still needs to be implemented. About the indicator The indicator covers habitats that are considered to be of European interest (listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive). The Habitats Directive protects 233 rare and characteristic natural and semi-natural habitat types (e.g. types of grasslands, wetlands, dunes) within the territory of the EU. Their conservation status is assessed by all EU Member States every 6 years, and these assessments and other data from the Member States are subsequently used to make EU-level assessments. There have been two reporting rounds so far (20002006 and 20072012). The indicator measures conservation status for habitat types in terms offavourable, unfavourableinadequate, unfavourablebad and unknown. Furthermore, the indicator measures trends for assessments with unfavourable conservation status: unfavourable improving, unfavourablestable, unfavourabledeteriorating, unfavourableunknown. The assessments are based on four parameters: (1) trends and status of range; (2) trends and status of the area; (3)structure and function including typical species; and(4)future prospects. "

This briefing addresses the issue of energy efficiency, with greenhouse gas emissions ( AIRS_PO2.5, 2015 ) 1  and renewables ( AIRS_PO2.6 ) 2  being considered in two other related briefings. Meeting the energy efficiency target requires a reduction in energy consumption. This should lead to a reduction in environmental pressures associated with the production and consumption of energy. It will also contribute to a reduction in dependence on energy imports and support the achievement of renewable energy and greenhouse gas targets.        Policy targets and progress       The Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) (EU, 2012) has a target of increasing energy efficiency by 20% by 2020 compared with a business-as-usual scenario (EC, 2011). The EED translates this into two separate 2020 reduction targets for the EUs primary and final energy consumption: a primary energy consumption of 1483Mtoe, representing a 13.4%reduction compared with 2005 levels, and a final energyconsumption of 1086Mtoe, representing an 8.8% reduction compared with 2005 levels.        In 2014, the EUs primary energy consumption was 11.8% lower than in 2005 (see Figure 1). According to preliminary estimates from the EEA, the EUs primary energy consumption increased slightly in 2015 (by 1% compared with 2014), while still remaining below the indicative linear trajectory (EEA, 2016a).           Figure 1.  Primary and finalenergy consumption in the EU andtargets for 2020 and 2030             In 2014, the EU has reduced its final energy consumption by 10.9% compared with 2005, which was already below the target level set for 2020. The energy demand in 2014 was exceptionally low because of favourable climatic conditions in 2014 (warm winter), which limited the demand for energy for heating in the EU Member States.    Between 2005 and 2014, primary energy consumption in the EU-28 decreased by 12%, particularly as a result of the reduction in final energy consumption observed during that period. The other factors contributing to this decrease included improved efficiency in the conversion of primary sources(e.g. coal and gas) into final energy and changes in the fuel mix to produce electricity and heat (higher penetration of renewable energy).   In the same period, final energy consumption in the EU-28 decreased by 10.9% in all sectors, with the industry and household sectors registering the largest decrease of 16.5% and 14.8%, respectively, followed by transport (4.5%) and services (1.7%). This development was influenced by energy efficiency policies, structural changes in industry, the economic downturn and the warmer winter.   Apart from the EED, other policies and measures adopted at EU level are expected to contribute towards the 20% reduction target. These include:     The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EU, 2010a),   Product regulations laying down minimum energy performance standards and requirements for energy labelling (the Eco-design Directive (EU, 2009) and the Labelling Directive (EU, 2010b),   CO 2  performance standards for cars and vans,   Increased financing through EU structural and investment funds, Horizon 2020 and dedicated facilities, such as European Local Energy Assistance (ELENA) and the European Energy Efficiency Fund,   The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and the Effort Sharing Decision for non-ETS sectors.          Almost half of the effort to reach the 2020 target at EU level should come from measures implemented  under Article 7   (1)   of the EED. The use of exemptions by Member States to reduce this target, as well as the inclusion of measures that are not eligible, might limit the contribution of the commitments made under this requirement to fulfil national energy efficiency targets (Ricardo-AEA et al., 2015).     Country level information   Figure 2. Primary Energy consumption in 2005 and 2015 and estimated national target for 2020         In 2014, 25 Member States reduced or limited their increase in primary energy consumption below the linear trajectories drawn between 2005 levels and the 2020 targets. Three Member States (Estonia, Malta and Sweden) had not achieved sufficient savings in primary energy consumption. According to preliminary data, the situation improved in 2015 for Estonia and Sweden, for which primary energy consumption levels fell below their respective linear trajectories. In contrast, in Bulgaria, France and Germany, primary energy consumption in 2015 was above their respective trajectories (EEA, 2016b).    Outlook beyond 2020   Continued improvements in energy efficiency will be needed well beyond 2020 if the 7th EAPs 2050 vision of Europe, in which low-carbon growth has long been decoupled from resource use, is to be achieved. In October 2014, the European Council endorsed an indicative energy efficiency target of a reduction of at least 27% by 2030, in comparison with the ECs 2007 energy baseline scenario (EC, 2014). This target should be reviewed by 2020, having in mind a 30% target.   About the indicator   Improving energy efficiency means using less energy for the same output or producing more with the same energy input. The 2020 target for energy efficiency has been interpreted to mean reductions in primary and final energy consumption. The indicator tracks levels of primary and final energy consumption in million tonnes of oil equivalents. Primary energy in this context covers the consumption of the energy sector itself, losses during the transformation (for example, from oil or gas into electricity) and distribution of energy, and final consumption by end users. It excludes energy carriers used for non-energy purposes (such as petroleum used for producing plastics). Final energy consumption is the total energy consumed by end users, such as households, industry, services, agriculture and fisheries. It is the energy that reaches the final consumers door and excludes the energy used by the energy sector itself and in deliveries to the transformation sector.,    Indicator   EU indicator past trend   Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020     Progress on energy efficiency in Europe      Improve energy efficiency by 20 % (compared with a business-as-usual scenario)  Energy Efficiency Directive        The EU as a whole is currently on track to meet its energy efficiency target.

Environmental noise causes at least 10000 cases of premature death in Europe each year, with almost 20 million adults suffering annoyance and a further 8 million suffering sleep disturbance (EEA, 2014). The WHO (2011) identified noise as the second most significant environmental cause of ill health, the first being air pollution ( AIRS_PO3.1, 2016 ). 1  The 7th EAP (EU, 2013) includes an objective to significantly decrease noise pollution by 2020, moving closer to WHO recommended levels.   Policy targets and progress   The Environmental Noise Directive (END) is the main EU instrument through which land-based noise emissions are monitored and actions developed. It defines environmental noise as unwanted or harmful outdoor sound created by human activities, including noise emitted by means of transport, road traffic, rail traffic, air traffic, and from sites of industrial activity (EU, 2002). It places an obligation on EU Member States to assess noise levels by producing strategic noise maps for all major roads, railways, airports and urban areas. Based on these noise-mapping results, Member States must prepare action plans containing measures that address noise issues and their effects for those areas where the specific END indicators (55dB averaged across the day, evening and night periods (L den ) and 50dB averaged across the night period (L night )) have been surpassed. The Directive neither sets limit values for noise exposure, nor prescribes measures for inclusion in the action plans. Finally, Member States are required to select and preserve areas of good acoustic environmental quality, referred to as quiet areas, in order to protect the European soundscape.   High noise levels are defined in the 7th EAP as noise levels for L den  above 55dB and for L night  above 50dB. During the night, high noise levels can cause sleep disturbance, such as body movements and wakening, starting at L night  levels below 40dB, and with effects on the cardiovascular system that become apparent above 55dB. All these impacts can contribute to premature mortality (WHO, 2009).   The WHO established a night-time noise guideline for L night  of 40dB for outside noise with the aim of protecting the public, including vulnerable groups such as children, the chronically ill and the elderly. An outside noise L night  value of 55dB was recommended as an interim target for countries where the night-time noise guideline cannot be achieved in the short term and where policymakers adopt a stepwise approach. The WHO night-time noise guideline is stricter than the L night  threshold of 50dB set under the END, providing a higher level of protection for human health. However, assessments cannot be made by comparing noise levels in Europe with WHO recommended levels, as Member States are not obliged to report this information.   Figure 1 provides an overview of the number of people exposed to levels of environmental noise in Europe that are above the noise indicators set by the END within and outside urban areas. The major source of noise pollution (measured in terms of number of affected people), both inside and outside urban areas, is road traffic. Noise from trains and aircraft has a much lower impact in terms of overall population exposure to noise, but it remains the major source of localised noise pollution (EEA, 2015).   More specifically, it is estimated that more than 125 million people in the EU are exposed to L den  levels from road traffic noise that are above 55dB.   Night-time road traffic is another major source of noise exposure, with over 83 million Europeans exposed to harmful L night  levels above 50dB. In addition, many people are also exposed to rail, aircraft and industrial noise, particularly in towns and cities. While aircraft noise does not affect a wide geographical area, the effects extend beyond health impacts on nearby populations to direct effects on the ability of younger generations to concentrate in schools that are affected by aircraft flight paths.    Figure 1. Estimated number of people exposed in the EU to noise above Lden 55 dB, 2012             Note: 1.'Urban areas are the urban agglomerations defined as such in the Environmental Noise Directive, that is the part of the territory, delimited by the Member State, having a population in excess of 100 000 persons and a population density such that the Member State considers it to be an urbanised area.   2. The numbers of people exposed can only be summed for the same source inside and outside urban areas and not across sources, since the latter could lead to double counting. 3. 55 dB Lden is the EU threshold for excess exposure defined in the Environmental Noise Directive and indicating an average level during the day, evening and night; dB=decibel.         Examples of measures to reduce noise exposure currently being undertaken at the national level include installing road and rail noise barriers and optimising aircraft movements around airports. However, it is widely acknowledged that the most effective actions to reduce exposure tend to be those that reduce noise at source, for example reducing the number of vehicles on the road, introducing quieter tyres for road vehicles or laying quieter road surfaces.   A major problem for the effectiveness of such measures is that, given the different factors that determine traffic noise, a single measure alone is often not sufficient to significantly reduce exposure.   Efforts to reduce the noise from individual sources tend to be offset by the higher numbers of people being exposed to high noise levels, due to increasing road and aviation traffic and increasing numbers of city inhabitants. Recent trends show a rise in car travel across the EU, with 77% of passenger-kilometres using car transport in 2013 compared with 65% in 2000 (EEA, 2015). The construction of new roads can also expose new areas and populations to road traffic noise.   In terms of the availability of data to assess recent trends in noise exposure, data were reported to the EEA in 2007 and in 2012 under two rounds of noise mapping assessments. There are, however, comparability issues between the two reporting rounds, because of a lack of common assessment methods and incomplete reporting of exposure assessments, with as little as 44 70 % of the expected amount of data, depending on source, being delivered in the second reporting round. However, the analysis of a sub-set of the reported data that were comparable revealed that exposure to noise has remained broadly constant between 2007 and 2012.   Finally, it is unlikely that noise pollution will decrease significantly by 2020, given that transport demand is expected to increase (EC, 2016), air traffic noise has been predicted to increase (EASA et al, 2016) and the  number of city inhabitants is also set to increase (Eurostat, 2016).    Country level information     Road traffic is the most widespread noise source in Europe and the source that causes the largest number of people to be exposed above the Environmental Noise Directive action levels for L den  and L night . This is true at the European scale, at country scale and both inside and outside urban areas. Nevertheless, a wide variation can be identified between countries in the number of people exposed to road traffic noise in urban areas. This is significantly influenced by factors such as the number of urban areas per country and the total number of inhabitants per urban area. The correlation between the total number of inhabitants in an urban area and the number of people exposed to road traffic noise is very strong.   Austria, Estonia, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain and Switzerland reported that more than 50% of inhabitants in urban areas (an urban agglomeration with more than 100000 inhabitants) were exposed to road noise L den  levels above 55dB, while Belgium, Bulgaria and Luxembourg reported figures of more than 75% for the equivalent exposure (Figure 2). At the other end of the scale, the number of inhabitants exposed to road noise L den  levels above 55dB in Germany, Iceland and Malta remained below 25%. As mentioned above, however, country-specific data are not immediately comparable.   Figure 2. Percentage of population exposed to road noise within urban areas above Lden 55 dB, by country, 2012       Note:   55 dB Lden is the EU threshold for excess exposure defined in the Environmental Noise Directive and indicating an average level during the day, evening and night; dB=decibel.    Outlook beyond 2020     Regarding the long-term outlook for the European soundscape, there are a number of challenges to reducing the exposure of the EU population to noise pollution. Economic growth and expanding transport networks can lead to increased transport levels that could, in turn, increase noise pollution. At the same time, trends towards increasing urbanisation (Eurostat, 2016) could lead to higher numbers of people being exposed. Transport demand, including for passenger cars is expected to increase by 2050 (EC, 2016 and EEA, 2015), with noise from road traffic representing the dominant source of environmental noise and noise from air traffic set to increase (EASA et al, 2016). On the other hand, intelligent transport systems could reduce noise levels from vehicles, in particular road vehicles. While the use of electric cars currently contributes to lower noise levels at low speeds in urban areas, the new EU regulation on the sound levels of motor vehicles (EU, 2014) will require the installation of artificial sound generators in all electric and hybrid vehicles by 2021 to improve safety for pedestrians. Whether or not exposure to noise increases or decreases beyond 2020 depends on the relative rates of these conflicting developments.   About the indicator     The Environmental Noise Directive (END) requires two main indicators to be applied in the assessment and management of environmental noise. The first indicator (L den ) is the noise level for the day, evening and night periods and is designed to measure annoyance. The END defines an L den  threshold of 55dB. The second indicator (L night ) is the noise level for night-time periods and is designed to assess sleep disturbance. The END defines an L night  threshold of 50dB. These indicators were calculated following the provisions of the END (EU, 2002). Member States must report the numbers of people who are exposed to noise levels above both thresholds for each noise source (e.g. roads, railways, airports, industry). The EEA uses these data to create an indicator for environmental noise in Europe. A complete assessment of exposure to environmental noise and a prognosis regarding the future outlook are hindered by the fact that exposure estimates reported by countries are not complete, with as little as 44 70 % of the expected amount of data, depending on source, being delivered in the second reporting round (EEA, 2014). The gaps in the reported data have been filled with expert estimates from the EEA. The lack of comparable and common assessment methods often causes significant inconsistencies between exposure estimates from different countries, within a single country and across the two main reporting rounds (2007 and 2012).,    Indicator   EU indicator pasttrend    Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020     Exposure to environmental noise      Significantly decrease noise pollution  7th EAP        Efforts to reduce environmental noise tend to be offset by an increase in the number of people being exposed to high noise levels, in particular due to increasing road and aviation traffic and an increase in the number of city inhabitants     For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the EEA Environmental indicator report 2016 Setting the Scene Noise exposure from transport sources and industry can lead to annoyance, stress reactions, sleep disturbance, and increases in the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

The major source of noise pollution (measured in terms of number of affected people), both inside and outside urban areas, is road traffic. Noise from trains and aircraft has a much lower impact in terms of overall population exposure to noise, but it remains the major source of localised noise pollution (EEA, 2015). More specifically, it is estimated that more than 125 million people in the EU are exposed to Lden levels from road traffic noise that are above 55dB. Night-time road traffic is another major source of noise exposure, with over 83 million Europeans exposed to harmful Lnight levels above 50dB. In addition, many people are also exposed to rail, aircraft and industrial noise, particularly in towns and cities. While aircraft noise does not affect a wide geographical area, the effects extend beyond health impacts on nearby populations to direct effects on the ability of younger generations to concentrate in schools that are affected by aircraft flight paths. Figure 1. Estimated number of people exposed in the EU to noise above Lden 55 dB, 2012  Note:1.'Urban areas are the urban agglomerations defined as such in the Environmental Noise Directive, that is the part of the territory, delimited by the Member State, having a population in excess of 100 000 persons and a population density such that the Member State considers it to be an urbanised area.2. The numbers of people exposed can only be summed for the same source inside and outside urban areas and not across sources, since the latter could lead to double counting.3. 55 dB Lden is the EU threshold for excess exposure defined in the Environmental Noise Directive and indicating an average level during the day, evening and night; dB=decibel. Examples of measures to reduce noise exposure currently being undertaken at the national level include installing road and rail noise barriers and optimising aircraft movements around airports. However, it is widely acknowledged that the most effective actions to reduce exposure tend to be those that reduce noise at source, for example reducing the number of vehicles on the road, introducing quieter tyres for road vehicles or laying quieter road surfaces. A major problem for the effectiveness of such measures is that, given the different factors that determine traffic noise, a single measure alone is often not sufficient to significantly reduce exposure. Efforts to reduce the noise from individual sources tend to be offset by the higher numbers of people being exposed to high noise levels, due to increasing road and aviation traffic and increasing numbers of city inhabitants. Recent trends show a rise in car travel across the EU, with 77% of passenger-kilometres using car transport in 2013 compared with 65% in 2000 (EEA, 2015). The construction of new roads can also expose new areas and populations to road traffic noise. In terms of the availability of data to assess recent trends in noise exposure, data were reported to the EEA in 2007 and in 2012 under two rounds of noise mapping assessments. There are, however, comparability issues between the two reporting rounds, because of a lack of common assessment methods and incomplete reporting of exposure assessments, with as little as 44 70 % of the expected amount of data, depending on source, being delivered in the second reporting round. However, the analysis of a sub-set of the reported data that were comparable revealed that exposure to noise has remained broadly constant between 2007 and 2012. Finally, it is unlikely that noise pollution will decrease significantly by 2020, given that transport demand is expected to increase (EC, 2016), air traffic noise has been predicted to increase (EASA et al, 2016) and the number of city inhabitants is also set to increase (Eurostat, 2016). Country level information Road traffic is the most widespread noise source in Europe and the source that causes the largest number of people to be exposed above the Environmental Noise Directive action levels for Lden and Lnight. This is true at the European scale, at country scale and both inside and outside urban areas. Nevertheless, a wide variation can be identified between countries in the number of people exposed to road traffic noise in urban areas. This is significantly influenced by factors such as the number of urban areas per country and the total number of inhabitants per urban area. The correlation between the total number of inhabitants in an urban area and the number of people exposed to road traffic noise is very strong. Austria, Estonia, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain and Switzerland reported that more than 50% of inhabitants in urban areas (an urban agglomeration with more than 100000 inhabitants) were exposed to road noise Lden levels above 55dB, while Belgium, Bulgaria and Luxembourg reported figures of more than 75% for the equivalent exposure (Figure 2). At the other end of the scale, the number of inhabitants exposed to road noise Lden levels above 55dB in Germany, Iceland and Malta remained below 25%. As mentioned above, however, country-specific data are not immediately comparable. Figure 2. Percentage of population exposed to road noise within urban areas above Lden 55 dB, by country, 2012  Note:55 dB Lden is the EU threshold for excess exposure defined in the Environmental Noise Directive and indicating an average level during the day, evening and night; dB=decibel. Outlook beyond 2020 Regarding the long-term outlook for the European soundscape, there are a number of challenges to reducing the exposure of the EU population to noise pollution. Economic growth and expanding transport networks can lead to increased transport levels that could, in turn, increase noise pollution. At the same time, trends towards increasing urbanisation (Eurostat, 2016) could lead to higher numbers of people being exposed. Transport demand, including for passenger cars is expected to increase by 2050 (EC, 2016 and EEA, 2015), with noise from road traffic representing the dominant source of environmental noise and noise from air traffic set to increase (EASA et al, 2016). On the other hand, intelligent transport systems could reduce noise levels from vehicles, in particular road vehicles. While the use of electric cars currently contributes to lower noise levels at low speeds in urban areas, the new EU regulation on the sound levels of motor vehicles (EU, 2014) will require the installation of artificial sound generators in all electric and hybrid vehicles by 2021 to improve safety for pedestrians. Whether or not exposure to noise increases or decreases beyond 2020 depends on the relative rates of these conflicting developments. About the indicator The Environmental Noise Directive (END) requires two main indicators to be applied in the assessment and management of environmental noise. The first indicator (Lden) is the noise level for the day, evening and night periods and is designed to measure annoyance. The END defines an Lden threshold of 55dB. The second indicator (Lnight) is the noise level for night-time periods and is designed to assess sleep disturbance. The END defines an Lnight threshold of 50dB. These indicators were calculated following the provisions of the END (EU, 2002). Member States must report the numbers of people who are exposed to noise levels above both thresholds for each noise source (e.g. roads, railways, airports, industry). The EEA uses these data to create an indicator for environmental noise in Europe. A complete assessment of exposure to environmental noise and a prognosis regarding the future outlook are hindered by the fact that exposure estimates reported by countries are not complete, with as little as 44 70 % of the expected amount of data, depending on source, being delivered in the second reporting round (EEA, 2014). The gaps in the reported data have been filled with expert estimates from the EEA. The lack of comparable and common assessment methods often causes significant inconsistencies between exposure estimates from different countries, within a single country and across the two main reporting rounds (2007 and 2012)."

Fishing is one of the main pressures affecting the marine environment, in particular the state of commercial fish species. Ensuring healthy fish populations is essential for well-functioning ecosystems, but also to sustain fishing as a source of healthy food in the long term.    Policy targets and progress    Safeguarding healthy commercial fish populations is one of the 11 descriptors of the MSFD (EU, 2008) for achieving GES. This objective is closely related to the objectives of the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) (EU, 2013b), in particular the objective of ensuring the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for all stocks by 2015 where possible, and at the latest by 2020.   Currently, around 58% of the assessed fish stocks in Europes seas are not in GES, whereas only 12% of fish stocks are in GES when assessing both the level of fishing mortality and reproductive capacity (EEA, 2015a). In addition, there are strong regional differences, as shown in Figure 1. The status of fish stocks is especially critical in the Mediterranean and Black Seas.       Figure 1. Status of fish stocks in regional seas around Europe          Note: This figure shows the proportion of assessed stocks per regional sea that are in good environmental status (GES). The numbers on the charts indicate the number of fish stocks.

The GES criterion on healthy age- and size-distribution cannot be assessed at present. Stocks in the Northeast Atlantic and Baltic waters were assessed based on   advice   from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) for 2013. Stocks in the Mediterranean and Black seas, and widely distributed stocks, were most recently assessed by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) respectively, which varied between 2008 and 2012.    Source:  Black Sea stock assessment ,  Mediterranean stock assessments ,  North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic sea stock assessments  Provided by  Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF)     Moreover, a lack of information on the status of stocks was observed for a large (40%) proportion of fish stocks (EEA, 2015a). Figure 2 shows that there are also strong regional differences in terms of availability of information. An assessment of status is not possible for 68% of the total landings from the Mediterranean and Black Seas, compared with 35% of those from the North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea (EEA, 2015b).    Figure 2. Proportion of fish landings with Good Environmental Status information            Note: This figure shows the proportion of commercial fish landings per regional sea with GES assessment information, as defined by Commission Decision 2010/477/EU, which sets criteria and methodological standards on the GES of marine waters. GES assessment information relates to fishing mortality (F) and reproductive capacity (SSB) criteria, since the criterion on healthy age- and size-distribution cannot be assessed at present.

Source:  Black Sea stock assessment ,  Mediterranean stock assessments ,  North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic sea stock assessments  Provided by    Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF)  .   It is clear that the overall use of fish stocks in Europe currently remains beyond the limit for long-term environmental sustainability. Historical trends in fish landings show that total landings in Europes seas reached a peak in the mid-1970s, but have been mostly declining ever since (Pastoors and Poulsen, 2008; Gascuel et al., 2014). The observed consistent decrease in landings suggests that the overall levels of exploitation remain too high for ensuringhealthy populations of commercial fish.   Important signs of improvement are being observed in the North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea. Since the early 2000s, better management of fish stocks has contributed to a clear decrease in fishing pressure in these two regional seas (EEA, 2015b; EC, 2015). Between 2002 and 2015, the number of stocks exploited at sustainable levels (i.e. fishing at or below MSY) increased from 2 to 26 (EC, 2015). Signs of recovery in the reproductive capacity of several fish stocks have started to appear (EEA, 2015a). If these efforts continue, meeting the 2020 objective for healthy fish stocks in the North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea could be possible. In contrast, there is little likelihood that the 2020 policy objective will be met in the Mediterranean and Black Seas (EC, 2015). Given this, despite the EUs commitment to ensuring better governance for sustainable fisheries in the Mediterranean region, the 2020 objective of healthy commercial fish populations is unlikely to be met for all marine waters and further collective action is required.    Outlook beyond 2020    Fishing management measures, when effectively implemented, can have a positive effect on the state of fish stocks, as can be seen in the North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea. However, ensuring healthy fish populations does not depend solely on fishing at environmentally sustainable levels, although it is a necessary condition. Healthy fish populations depend on healthy marine ecosystems but, today, our use of Europes seas and their natural capital is not sustainable (EEA, 2015b). Europes marine ecosystems continue to display symptoms of degradation and loss of resilience, which will be exacerbated by the effects of climate change. These systemic changes are still complex and to a large extent poorly understood, but they are closely linked to the loss of biodiversity. Without an integrated approach to the management and protection of Europes seas  which would make ecosystem-based management a reality, as required by both the MSFD and the CFP  the outlook beyond 2020 for productive seas and healthy fish populations calls for concern.    About the indicator    The indicator assesses the status of fish stocks in Europes regional seas, which represent the populations of commercial fish and shellfish species, in relation to their GES. The indicator also provides an overview of the availability of information to provide a GES analysis. The indicator follows the GES methodological standards as currently defined by Commission Decision 2010/477/EU (EC, 2010). It measures GES by assessing two criteria  the level of fishing mortality (i.e. fishing pressure) and the reproductive capacity of fish stocks (i.e. spawning stock biomass)  against their sustainable reference levels (i.e. MSY or a proxy). The third GES criterion on healthy age and size distribution cannot be assessed at present.

The rate of increase in resource productivity has been projected to return to the more gradual rate seen prior to the economic downturn of just below 1 % per year             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016      Setting the Scene   The 7th EAP priority objective 2 (EU, 2013) includes the objective that by 2020 the resource efficiency of the EU has to improve. Resource efficiency can lower environmental burdens by reducing the overall consumption of materials and other resources. It can also help to sustain economic development by securing the appropriate supply of resources and investments in innovation, while increasing global competitiveness (OECD, 2015). This briefing presents trends in resource productivity. Since resource productivity measures the quantity of economic output produced using a certain amount of extracted resources, it is used as a proxy for resource efficiency by the European Commission. It effectively measures the decoupling of material use from economic growth. However, under conditions of relative decoupling, overall material use can increase despite an increase in resource productivity.    Policy targets and progress    The Resource-efficient Europe flagship initiative (EC, 2011a) of the Europe 2020 Strategy is aimed at promoting the decoupling of economic growth from resource use. Absolute decoupling means that resource use declines or remains stable under conditions of economic growth.   The broad objectives of the Resource-efficient Europe flagship initiative are implemented by the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011b) whose goal is to ensure increasing economic performance while reducing pressure on natural resources. Resource efficiency is viewed as the means to achieve this objective and resource productivity is the lead indicator for monitoring the progress of the actions in the roadmap. Neither the roadmap nor any other EU policy or strategy sets quantitative targets for improvements in resource productivity, although some Member States have adopted national targets (see country-level information section).   The Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe committed the European Commission to discussing and agreeing on resource efficiency indicators and targets. The 7th EAP recognised that Resource efficiency indicators and targets  would provide the necessary guidance for public and private decision-makers in transforming the economy. Once agreed at Union level, such indicators and targets will become an integral part of the 7th EAP. While targets have not been defined to date, a set of indicators has been published since 2015 in the form of the Resource Efficiency Scoreboard (EC, 2015a).    Figure 1. Resource productivity, domestic material consumption (DMC) and gross domestic product (GDP) in the European Union             Although there were some fluctuations, 2000 to 2007 was a period during which material use (domestic material consumption, DMC) saw relative decoupling from economic growth (gross domestic product, GDP). In other words, material use grew but at a slower rate than the economy. Resource productivity for the EU as a whole increased by nearly 7 % over this period. The period from 2007 onwards is characterised by absolute decoupling, as material use has declined sharply.   Between 2008 and 2009, both material use and GDP decreased, although material use fell more rapidly than GDP. Since 2009, despite some return to economic growth, material use has continued to fall. The overall result of the trends in these two variables is that resource productivity increased by 35 % between 2000 and 2015, with most of the improvement occurring after 2008.   Europe appears to be extracting more value from the material resources it uses. While this is indeed a positive development, a closer look reveals that it would not be justified to attribute this entirely to the success of environmental policies. Other economic and technical factors seem to have played a role, including the changing structure of countries economies, the effect of the economic downturn, globalisation and increasing reliance on imports, and even the nature of the indicator itself (EEA, 2016).   There have been some improvements in the resource productivity of individual sectors. Since 2008, this has been dominated by the fact that the economic downturn affected the material-intensive industries of manufacturing and construction more than it affected services, which typically are less material intensive (Eurostat, 2015a).   The 19 % drop in total material use between 2007 and 2015 was largely due to a 29 % decline in the demand for non-metallic minerals (Figure 2). This was caused by a slump in the construction sector where gross value added (in chain-linked volumes, reference year 2010) fell by almost 17 % over the same period (Eurostat, 2016a).    Figure 2. Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) by type of material, EU             A slowdown in construction activity can have significant implications for the resource productivity of the economy as a whole. In 2007, the construction sector was responsible for more than one third of total material use in the EU (Eurostat, 2016b) but contributed only 6.4 % of its total economic output (Eurostat, 2016a). Therefore, this sector had a low resource productivity compared with the economy as a whole. Any shrinkage in this sector, as occurred between 2007 and 2013, will therefore lead to an increase in the resource productivity of the whole economy. The same is true for the manufacturing industries.   There have also been some improvements in the resource productivity of some other sectors. A notable example is the decline in the consumption of fossil fuels since 2004. This decline accelerated immediately after the economic downturn and is also the result of an increasing shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy and of overall improvements in energy efficiency in the economy as a whole (EEA, 2016). These latter developments can be expected to continue to 2020 and beyond in response to EU and national climate and energy policies.   A further cause of the underlying increase in resource productivity may be the long-term shift of the EU towards a service economy. Services increased their contribution to the EU economy from 71.5 % in 2003 to 73.5 % in 2013 (Eurostat, 2015b).   Detailed projections of material use within the four main material groups from 2012 to 2030 have been carried out for the European Commission. A wide range of factors was modelled, including technological developments, policy in energy and climate, agriculture, transport and the manufacturing sector, and demographic and economic trends. The modelling analysis projects a 0.7 % rise in material use per year but a higher rate of growth in GDP, resulting in a 0.9 % increase in resource productivity per year (Cambridge Econometrics, 2014). This is similar to the rate observed between 2000 and 2008. The projections would suggest that the 7th EAP 2020 objective of increasing resource efficiency should be met.    Country-level information    Resource productivity varies between countries by a factor of nearly 20. This variation is not a sign of more efficient industry in one country compared with another, but rather a reflection of the types of material resources available in the country and its economic structures. Countries with service-based economies will tend to have higher resource productivity than economies with a high proportion of heavy industry, since service industries typically have a lower demand for material inputs (EEA, 2013).           Figure 3.  Resource productivity by country         Note: 2013 is the latest year for Norway and Serbia. Resource productivity is measured in Euros (chain-linked volumes, reference year 2010) per kilogram of domestic material consumption (euroCLV2010/kg DMC).   Countries with the highest resource productivity in the EU are the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, with values around EUR 3.5/kg. Resource productivity improved in all but three Member States between 2000 and 2015. The exceptions were Estonia, Malta and Romania. For many countries, gains in resource productivity have been most prominent since 2008. These have again largely been caused by a drop in the demand for non-metallic minerals, as a result of a post-downturn slump in the construction sector, and to longer term reductions in the consumption of fossil fuel carriers. The countries that experienced the sharpest decline in material use for non-metallic minerals between 2007 and 2015 were Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain, ranging from a 75 % reduction in the case of Spain to a 42 % reduction in the case of Portugal.   It is hard to determine whether policy has had an effect or not. Only three countries (Austria, Finland and Germany) and two sub-national regions (Flanders and Scotland) have adopted dedicated strategies for resource efficiency. A number of other countries incorporate resource productivity concepts into other strategies and policies, including those on waste, energy and industrial development, or national reform programmes (EEA, 2016). National efforts to improve resource productivity are based on a mixture of economic and environmental considerations. The most prominent factors are the need to increase competitiveness and to secure access to raw materials and energy (or reduce reliance on imports), while lowering pressures on the environment. In addition, a number of European countries have already developed, or are planning to develop, national raw material strategies (EEA, 2016).   Moreover, nine EU Member States (Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia) have adopted resource productivity targets (as of December 2015). These vary somewhat in their scope, format and timeframes, but all aim to achieve improvements in resource productivity. It is difficult to compare the ambitions of these targets between countries because of the varying time periods over which they have to be achieved and the different starting levels in terms of resource productivity (Figure 3). With the exception of Germany, all countries targets were adopted after the economic downturn and most since 2012. The effects of Member State targets and policies may become evident only during the second half of the decade.   Improving resource productivity has not necessarily led to reduced overall material use. Of the 25 EU Member States whose resource productivity improved between 2000 and 2015, eight (Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden) have, nevertheless, experienced an increase in demand for materials of between 19 % and 46 % over the same period. The three countries (Estonia, Malta and Romania) that did not achieve improvements in resource productivity saw even higher increases in material use. Romania, Estonia and Maltas material use rose by 168 %, 104 % and 60 %, respectively (Eurostat, 2016b). In general, policies and targets for reducing overall material use are far less common than those aimed at increasing resource productivity.    Outlook beyond 2020    The long-term vision of the 7th EAP includes the goal that Europes growth should be decoupled from resource use. This means not only improvements in resource productivity, but also absolute reductions in material use.   The EU has been forecast, under certain conditions, to increase its resource productivity by 14 % between 2014 and 2030 (Cambridge Econometrics, 2014). Through specific policies to promote the transition to a more circular economy, as called for by the  European Resource Efficiency Platform   , this rate could possibly double. While contributing significantly to the sustainability dimension of growth, increasing resource productivity by 30 % would also have a positive impact on job creation and GDP growth (EC, 2014b).    Industry already recognises the strong business case for improving resource productivity. It is estimated that resource efficiency improvements along the whole value chain could reduce the need for material inputs by 17  24 % by 2030 (Cambridge Econometrics, 2014). Better use of resources could represent an overall savings potential of EUR 630 billion per year for the European manufacturing industry (INNOVA, 2012).   Of the nine countries that have adopted resource productivity targets, five include targets beyond 2020: Austria, France, Latvia, Portugal and Slovenia. Austria aims to achieve a four- to ten-fold increase in resource productivity over 2008 levels by 2050. Such ambitious targets and a more resource-efficient EU will require further fundamental changes in production and consumption patterns. The adoption of the Circular Economy Package (EC, 2015a) and recent efforts by some countries to analyse their material resource availability and needs, and to develop raw material strategies, demonstrate that Member States are changing their approach towards the use of materials.          About the indicator          Resource productivity is measured here as the economic output (GDP) in euros (chain-linked volumes, reference year 2010) per unit weight (kilograms) of material use (DMC). DMC comprises the consumption of fossil energy carriers, biomass, metal ores and non-metallic minerals, such as sand and gravel, used in construction. DMC is measured as the used weight of domestically extracted material, plus the direct weight of imports, minus the direct weight of exports.   A potential weakness of using DMC in a resource productivity indicator is that DMC excludes the raw materials extracted in non-EU countries and embedded in imported goods. An alternative to DMC as a resource productivity indicator is raw material consumption (RMC). RMC presents the import and export flows expressed in their raw material equivalents. These are currently estimated with models and are still under development. RMC has been developed by Eurostat for the EU-27 but is not yet available for individual Member States. In contrast, DMC is available for all Member States, has a long time series and is disaggregated into material components.   Both DMC and RMC have their weaknesses as proxies for environmental pressures caused by material use. All material types are given equal significance when compiling DMC. This is despite large differences in scarcity and the impacts caused per kilogram by the extraction of different types of material and use, e.g. gravel versus mercury. Moreover, DMC and RMC have exhibited similar trends since at least 2002, and therefore the choice of one or the other will have had little effect on trends to date in resource productivity (EEA, 2015; Figure 2).,    Indicator   EU indicator pasttrend    Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlookof the EU meetingthe selectedobjective by 2020      Resource productivity        Improve economic performance while reducing pressure on natural resources  Roadmap to a resource efficient Europe          There was a decline in the use of materials and a rapid rate of increase in resource productivity following the economic downturn of 2007/2008. The rate of increase in resource productivity has been projected to return to the more gradual rate seen prior to the economic downturn of just below 1 % per year     For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the EEA Environmental indicator report 2016 Setting the Scene The 7th EAP priority objective 2 (EU, 2013) includes the objective that by 2020 the resource efficiency of the EU has to improve. Resource efficiency can lower environmental burdens by reducing the overall consumption of materials and other resources. It can also help to sustain economic development by securing the appropriate supply of resources and investments in innovation, while increasing global competitiveness (OECD, 2015). This briefing presents trends in resource productivity. Since resource productivity measures the quantity of economic output produced using a certain amount of extracted resources, it is used as a proxy for resource efficiency by the European Commission. It effectively measures the decoupling of material use from economic growth. However, under conditions of relative decoupling, overall material use can increase despite an increase in resource productivity. Policy targets and progress The Resource-efficient Europe flagship initiative (EC, 2011a) of the Europe 2020 Strategy is aimed at promoting the decoupling of economic growth from resource use. Absolute decoupling means that resource use declines or remains stable under conditions of economic growth. The broad objectives of the Resource-efficient Europe flagship initiative are implemented by the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011b) whose goal is to ensure increasing economic performance while reducing pressure on natural resources. Resource efficiency is viewed as the means to achieve this objective and resource productivity is the lead indicator for monitoring the progress of the actions in the roadmap. Neither the roadmap nor any other EU policy or strategy sets quantitative targets for improvements in resource productivity, although some Member States have adopted national targets (see country-level information section). The Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe committed the European Commission to discussing and agreeing on resource efficiency indicators and targets. The 7th EAP recognised that Resource efficiency indicators and targets  would provide the necessary guidance for public and private decision-makers in transforming the economy. Once agreed at Union level, such indicators and targets will become an integral part of the 7th EAP. While targets have not been defined to date, a set of indicators has been published since 2015 in the form of the Resource Efficiency Scoreboard (EC, 2015a). Figure 1. Resource productivity, domestic material consumption (DMC) and gross domestic product (GDP) in the European Union    Although there were some fluctuations, 2000 to 2007 was a period during which material use (domestic material consumption, DMC) saw relative decoupling from economic growth (gross domestic product, GDP). In other words, material use grew but at a slower rate than the economy. Resource productivity for the EU as a whole increased by nearly 7 % over this period. The period from 2007 onwards is characterised by absolute decoupling, as material use has declined sharply. Between 2008 and 2009, both material use and GDP decreased, although material use fell more rapidly than GDP. Since 2009, despite some return to economic growth, material use has continued to fall. The overall result of the trends in these two variables is that resource productivity increased by 35 % between 2000 and 2015, with most of the improvement occurring after 2008. Europe appears to be extracting more value from the material resources it uses. While this is indeed a positive development, a closer look reveals that it would not be justified to attribute this entirely to the success of environmental policies. Other economic and technical factors seem to have played a role, including the changing structure of countries economies, the effect of the economic downturn, globalisation and increasing reliance on imports, and even the nature of the indicator itself (EEA, 2016). There have been some improvements in the resource productivity of individual sectors. Since 2008, this has been dominated by the fact that the economic downturn affected the material-intensive industries of manufacturing and construction more than it affected services, which typically are less material intensive (Eurostat, 2015a). The 19 % drop in total material use between 2007 and 2015 was largely due to a 29 % decline in the demand for non-metallic minerals (Figure 2). This was caused by a slump in the construction sector where gross value added (in chain-linked volumes, reference year 2010) fell by almost 17 % over the same period (Eurostat, 2016a). Figure 2. Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) by type of material, EU    A slowdown in construction activity can have significant implications for the resource productivity of the economy as a whole. In 2007, the construction sector was responsible for more than one third of total material use in the EU (Eurostat, 2016b) but contributed only 6.4 % of its total economic output (Eurostat, 2016a). Therefore, this sector had a low resource productivity compared with the economy as a whole. Any shrinkage in this sector, as occurred between 2007 and 2013, will therefore lead to an increase in the resource productivity of the whole economy. The same is true for the manufacturing industries. There have also been some improvements in the resource productivity of some other sectors. A notable example is the decline in the consumption of fossil fuels since 2004. This decline accelerated immediately after the economic downturn and is also the result of an increasing shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy and of overall improvements in energy efficiency in the economy as a whole (EEA, 2016). These latter developments can be expected to continue to 2020 and beyond in response to EU and national climate and energy policies. A further cause of the underlying increase in resource productivity may be the long-term shift of the EU towards a service economy. Services increased their contribution to the EU economy from 71.5 % in 2003 to 73.5 % in 2013 (Eurostat, 2015b). Detailed projections of material use within the four main material groups from 2012 to 2030 have been carried out for the European Commission. A wide range of factors was modelled, including technological developments, policy in energy and climate, agriculture, transport and the manufacturing sector, and demographic and economic trends. The modelling analysis projects a 0.7 % rise in material use per year but a higher rate of growth in GDP, resulting in a 0.9 % increase in resource productivity per year (Cambridge Econometrics, 2014). This is similar to the rate observed between 2000 and 2008. The projections would suggest that the 7th EAP 2020 objective of increasing resource efficiency should be met. Country-level information Resource productivity varies between countries by a factor of nearly 20. This variation is not a sign of more efficient industry in one country compared with another, but rather a reflection of the types of material resources available in the country and its economic structures. Countries with service-based economies will tend to have higher resource productivity than economies with a high proportion of heavy industry, since service industries typically have a lower demand for material inputs (EEA, 2013).  Figure 3. Resource productivity by country  Note: 2013 is the latest year for Norway and Serbia. Resource productivity is measured in Euros (chain-linked volumes, reference year 2010) per kilogram of domestic material consumption (euroCLV2010/kg DMC). Countries with the highest resource productivity in the EU are the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, with values around EUR 3.5/kg. Resource productivity improved in all but three Member States between 2000 and 2015. The exceptions were Estonia, Malta and Romania. For many countries, gains in resource productivity have been most prominent since 2008. These have again largely been caused by a drop in the demand for non-metallic minerals, as a result of a post-downturn slump in the construction sector, and to longer term reductions in the consumption of fossil fuel carriers. The countries that experienced the sharpest decline in material use for non-metallic minerals between 2007 and 2015 were Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain, ranging from a 75 % reduction in the case of Spain to a 42 % reduction in the case of Portugal. It is hard to determine whether policy has had an effect or not. Only three countries (Austria, Finland and Germany) and two sub-national regions (Flanders and Scotland) have adopted dedicated strategies for resource efficiency. A number of other countries incorporate resource productivity concepts into other strategies and policies, including those on waste, energy and industrial development, or national reform programmes (EEA, 2016). National efforts to improve resource productivity are based on a mixture of economic and environmental considerations. The most prominent factors are the need to increase competitiveness and to secure access to raw materials and energy (or reduce reliance on imports), while lowering pressures on the environment. In addition, a number of European countries have already developed, or are planning to develop, national raw material strategies (EEA, 2016). Moreover, nine EU Member States (Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia) have adopted resource productivity targets (as of December 2015). These vary somewhat in their scope, format and timeframes, but all aim to achieve improvements in resource productivity. It is difficult to compare the ambitions of these targets between countries because of the varying time periods over which they have to be achieved and the different starting levels in terms of resource productivity (Figure 3). With the exception of Germany, all countries targets were adopted after the economic downturn and most since 2012. The effects of Member State targets and policies may become evident only during the second half of the decade. Improving resource productivity has not necessarily led to reduced overall material use. Of the 25 EU Member States whose resource productivity improved between 2000 and 2015, eight (Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden) have, nevertheless, experienced an increase in demand for materials of between 19 % and 46 % over the same period. The three countries (Estonia, Malta and Romania) that did not achieve improvements in resource productivity saw even higher increases in material use. Romania, Estonia and Maltas material use rose by 168 %, 104 % and 60 %, respectively (Eurostat, 2016b). In general, policies and targets for reducing overall material use are far less common than those aimed at increasing resource productivity. Outlook beyond 2020 The long-term vision of the 7th EAP includes the goal that Europes growth should be decoupled from resource use. This means not only improvements in resource productivity, but also absolute reductions in material use.

Excessive nutrient losses affect soil, air and water quality, have a negative impact on ecosystems and have the potential to cause significant problems for human health. This nutrient pollution also results in significant economic losses and increased costs for society (e.g. in relation to tourism and recreation, human health and drinking water treatment). If not applied correctly (e.g. taking account of weather conditions, stage of crop growth, dosage, etc.), fertilisers cause excess nutrients to be released to the wider environment by run-off into surface water ( AIRS_PO1.9, 2016 ). 1  or leaching into groundwater. Eutrophication caused by excess nutrients can result in increases in weeds and algae, reduced oxygen levels and subsequent biodiversity loss. These impacts can be reduced by balancing nutrient inputs with the outputs of the agricultural system (i.e. nutrients contained in grazed and harvested crops) in order to limit nutrient losses to the environment. Both nitrogen and phosphorus are important sources of nutrient pollution, although, nitrogen losses are currently the most significant nutrient losses, in particular from agricultural production that have a negative impact on ecosystems. Therefore, this briefing focuses on the nitrogen balance in agricultural land.   Policy targets and progress   There are no environmental acquis objectives that match the 7th EAP objective of managing the nutrient cycle in a more cost-effective, sustainable and resource-efficient way. Nevertheless, several directives relate to the nutrient cycle. The EU Nitrates Directive (EU, 1991) aims to reduce water pollution by nitrates from agricultural sources and prevent pollution of ground and surface waters. To achieve this, the Directive sets legally binding maximum concentrations of nitrates in drinking water, limits the annual application of nitrogen fertiliser and livestock manure and designates periods during which nitrogen application is prohibited. There are several other EU directives that are relevant to the impact of excessive nutrient use in agriculture, namely the EU Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000) through its legal obligation to protect and restore the quality of all inland and coastal waters across Europe, the Directive on Sewage Sludge (EU, 1986) through its regulation of the use of sewage sludge in agriculture, as well as legal instruments of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which encompass environmental requirements (cross-compliance) and targeted environmental measures that form part of the Rural Development Programmes. Achieving a gross nutrient balance that implies acceptable losses to the environment, although not a stated aim of these directives, is a key contributor to achieving some of the aims of these directives.   In the period between 2000 and 2013, the gross balance between nitrogen added to and removed from agricultural land in the EU showed an improving trend (Figure 1), meaning that the gap between inputs and outputs is closing and, therefore, the overall nitrogen balance is improving. The surplus of nitrogen applied to agricultural land fell by about 19%, from 63kg per hectare in 2000 to51kg per hectare in 2013 (Figure 1).   The causes of these improvements include nitrogen management practices; of these, the most important are changes in fertiliser application techniques (Eurostat, 2015) as a result of the implementation of specific measures of the Common Agricultural Policy and EU legislation.   Figure 1. Gross nitrogenbalance, EU        Assessing whether the nitrogen cycle is managed sustainably holds many challenges, and determining a sustainable level of nitrogen balance is not trivial. A zero balance for nitrogen might not be realistic because of the inevitable losses of nitrogen to air (mainly ammonia) and water (mainly nitrate). The main focus should be on reducing losses to the minimum level possible  for instance through resource-efficient agricultural practices  and on reaching a better understanding of acceptable losses of these nitrogen compounds to the environment. This can be estimated through a critical loads (inputs) approach, which is a quantitative estimate of the upper limit of pollution exposure at which harmful effects to the environment (water, ecosystems, species) can be avoided. Work is ongoing to improve our understanding of critical loads for the EUs ecosystems (EEA, forthcoming).   When considering critical loads of nitrogen in surface water and in air with respect to biodiversity (habitat quality) in 2010 (EEA, 2015a; EEA, forthcoming), the amounts of nitrogen applied to the system were found to still substantially exceed acceptable inputs and related losses, despite the decreasing trend in the nitrogen balance. This is confirmed by the reported eutrophication pressure on the EUs protected species and habitats (EEA, 2015b) ( AIRS_PO1.7, 2016 ) 2 , ( AIRS_PO1.8, 2016 ). 3    Reductions in fertiliser use and livestock numbers are helping to improve the nitrogen balance, but agriculture remains an important source of nitrogen in surface waters (EU, 2010). Agriculture, particularly runoff from agricultural land, is typically contributing 50  80% of the total nitrogen load in European surface waters (EEA, 2005), affecting nitrogen levels in freshwater (EEA, 2015c) and transitional, coastal and marine waters (EEA, 2015d). Mineral fertilisers deliver on average slightly more than 45% of the nitrogen input in the EU, while nearly 40% comes from organic fertilisers, i.e. manure (EEA, forthcoming).   Within the EU, mineral fertilisers are applied to agricultural soils mainly as straight nitrogen fertilisers in the form of ammonium nitrate. Since the 1990s, although the total agricultural surface area has decreased, the area of certain crops that receive high application rates of ammonium nitrate, such as wheat and oilseed rape, has increased. Nitrogen in mineral fertilisers is particularly soluble to facilitate uptake by crops, but this also makes it susceptible to run-off following heavy rainfall and to leaching to groundwater (Eurostat, 1999). In countries with intensive livestock production, critical losses to water and air (with related effects on biodiversity) occur predominantly as a result of excess manure inputs (EEA, forthcoming). Manure inputs, in particular, contribute to ammonia (NH 3 -N) emissions.   In conclusion, overall, the agricultural nitrogen balance shows an improving trend. However, on average, the EU still has an unacceptable surplus of nitrogen in agricultural land in relation to losses to the environment, so further efforts are needed to manage the nutrient cycle for nitrogen in a sustainable way in the EU.   Country level information   Agricultural nitrogen balances show an improvement from 2000 to 2013 in the majority of European countries, with the exception of some countries: Austria, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, and Slovakia (Figure 2).   Figure 2. Gross nitrogen balance, by country        In most countries, implementation of the Nitrates Directive and other agricultural improvements has tended to stabilise or reduce nitrogen inputs, potentially reducing environmental pressures (Eurostat, 2015).   Although decreasing in most Member States, agricultural nitrogen surpluses are still high in some parts of Europe, in particular in Western Europe and in some Mediterranean countries. Even in countries with low national averages, there can be regions with high loadings, depending on agricultural intensity, including livestock density.   Outlook beyond 2020   Future trends in the use of mineral fertilisers will depend on a number of factors, in particular on future EU agricultural and environmental policies. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), while fertiliser use is set to decline marginally in western Europe until 2018, it is set to increase in central and eastern Europe, mainly because of an increase in ammonia production capacity (ammonia is used to produce fertilisers) in eastern Europe (FAO, 2015), which is likely to increase fertiliser production, with the subsequent risks of excessive nutrient application.   Some of the actions likely to influence nutrient use in EU countries result from further uptake of agri-environmental measures that focus on the reduction of inputs. These include measures to further implement the Nitrates Directive and increased use of soil sampling and fertiliser advice programmes to encourage the trend towards optimal application.   About the indicator   The indicator estimates the potential surplus (or deficit) of nitrogen in agricultural land. It calculates the balance between nitrogen added to an agricultural system and nitrogen removed from the system annually in kilograms of nitrogen per hectare of agricultural land. The input side of the balance counts mineral fertiliser application and manure excretion as well as atmospheric deposition, biological fixation and biosolids (compost, sludge and sewage) input, while the output side of the balance represents the removal from grassland (grazing and mowing) and the net crop uptake (removal) from arable land. The gross nitrogen balance takes an extended soil surface or land surface as the system boundary, meaning that it also includes the nitrogen losses from animal housing and manure management (e.g. storage) systems.   The data used are partly based on experts estimates of various physical parameters for the country as a whole. Differing assumptions mean that the balances should only be considered as consistent within a country and that comparison between countries should be made with caution. There may also be large regional variations within a country, and therefore national figures should be interpreted with care. In fact, gross nitrogen balance calculations are available up to NUTS 3 level (NUTS is the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics). Further downscaling is possible but introduces additional uncertainty in the data. Nevertheless, higher resolution data provide an insight into the variations and intensity of regional and local nitrogen losses, and subsequent negative impacts on regional and local ecosystems and biodiversity.,    Indicator   EU indicator past trend    Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020      Gross nutrient balance in agricultural land: nitrogen       Manage the nutrient cycle in a more sustainable way (nitrogen)  7th EAP      Overall, the agricultural nitrogen balance shows an improving trend.

Agriculture, particularly runoff from agricultural land, is typically contributing 50  80% of the total nitrogen load in European surface waters (EEA, 2005), affecting nitrogen levels in freshwater (EEA, 2015c) and transitional, coastal and marine waters (EEA, 2015d).

Nitrogen in mineral fertilisers is particularly soluble to facilitate uptake by crops, but this also makes it susceptible to run-off following heavy rainfall and to leaching to groundwater (Eurostat, 1999). In countries with intensive livestock production, critical losses to water and air (with related effects on biodiversity) occur predominantly as a result of excess manure inputs (EEA, forthcoming). Manure inputs, in particular, contribute to ammonia (NH3-N) emissions. In conclusion, overall, the agricultural nitrogen balance shows an improving trend. However, on average, the EU still has an unacceptable surplus of nitrogen in agricultural land in relation to losses to the environment, so further efforts are needed to manage the nutrient cycle for nitrogen in a sustainable way in the EU. Country level information Agricultural nitrogen balances show an improvement from 2000 to 2013 in the majority of European countries, with the exception of some countries: Austria, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, and Slovakia (Figure 2). Figure 2. Gross nitrogen balance, by country  In most countries, implementation of the Nitrates Directive and other agricultural improvements has tended to stabilise or reduce nitrogen inputs, potentially reducing environmental pressures (Eurostat, 2015). Although decreasing in most Member States, agricultural nitrogen surpluses are still high in some parts of Europe, in particular in Western Europe and in some Mediterranean countries. Even in countries with low national averages, there can be regions with high loadings, depending on agricultural intensity, including livestock density. Outlook beyond 2020 Future trends in the use of mineral fertilisers will depend on a number of factors, in particular on future EU agricultural and environmental policies. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), while fertiliser use is set to decline marginally in western Europe until 2018, it is set to increase in central and eastern Europe, mainly because of an increase in ammonia production capacity (ammonia is used to produce fertilisers) in eastern Europe (FAO, 2015), which is likely to increase fertiliser production, with the subsequent risks of excessive nutrient application. Some of the actions likely to influence nutrient use in EU countries result from further uptake of agri-environmental measures that focus on the reduction of inputs. These include measures to further implement the Nitrates Directive and increased use of soil sampling and fertiliser advice programmes to encourage the trend towards optimal application. About the indicator The indicator estimates the potential surplus (or deficit) of nitrogen in agricultural land. It calculates the balance between nitrogen added to an agricultural system and nitrogen removed from the system annually in kilograms of nitrogen per hectare of agricultural land. The input side of the balance counts mineral fertiliser application and manure excretion as well as atmospheric deposition, biological fixation and biosolids (compost, sludge and sewage) input, while the output side of the balance represents the removal from grassland (grazing and mowing) and the net crop uptake (removal) from arable land. The gross nitrogen balance takes an extended soil surface or land surface as the system boundary, meaning that it also includes the nitrogen losses from animal housing and manure management (e.g. storage) systems. The data used are partly based on experts estimates of various physical parameters for the country as a whole. Differing assumptions mean that the balances should only be considered as consistent within a country and that comparison between countries should be made with caution. There may also be large regional variations within a country, and therefore national figures should be interpreted with care. In fact, gross nitrogen balance calculations are available up to NUTS 3 level (NUTS is the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics). Further downscaling is possible but introduces additional uncertainty in the data. Nevertheless, higher resolution data provide an insight into the variations and intensity of regional and local nitrogen losses, and subsequent negative impacts on regional and local ecosystems and biodiversity."

This briefing presents trends in the use of freshwater resources. Water is an input to key economic sectors such as agriculture, tourism and industry, and it is an essential component for preserving biodiversity and maintaining other freshwater ecosystem services such as public water supply. It is therefore important that water use (as measured by the Water Exploitation Index plus (WEI+)) respects the limits of available renewable freshwater resources and that water stress be prevented or significantly reduced.    Policy targets and progress    The EUs Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011) includes a milestone for 2020 that water abstraction should stay below 20% of available renewable freshwater resources. As quantity and quality of water are closely linked, achieving good status under the Water Framework Directive (see  Surface waters briefing, AIRS_PO1.9, 2016 ) 1  also requires ensuring that there is no overexploitation of water resources.   While freshwater is relatively abundant in Europe (EEA, 2015), water availability and socio-economic activity are unevenly distributed, leading to major differences in water stress levels across the continent. Except in some northern and sparsely populated areas that possess abundant freshwater resources, water stress occurs during the summer months in many areas of Europe, in particular in densely populated areas and the Mediterranean (Figure 1). Almost 17% of total renewable freshwater resources are abstracted in those regions, which are confronted with a difficult combination of a severe lack of freshwater and a high demand for it.   Figure 1. Water Exploitation Index plus for Europe, 2014           Source:  a)  The European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR), Member States reporting under Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 , b)  Waterbase - UWWTD: Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive  reported data , c)  Waterbase - Water Quantity , d)   European catchments and Rivers network system (Ecrins) .     Note:   The Water Exploitation Index Plus has been calculated at the sub basin scale on seasonal resolution and then aggregated to river basin district scale. The reference year is 2014 (Q1: January, February, March; Q2: April, May, June; Q3: July, August, September; Q4: October, November, December). The spatial reference data used when estimating the WEI+ is the ECRINS (European catchments and rivers network system). The ECRINS delineation of sub basin and river basin district differ from those defined by Member States under the Water Framework Directive, particularly for transboundary river basin districts. Click on  more info  to see time series in WEI+ including level of sectorial pressures over freshwater resource    Rivers and groundwater aquifers supply more than 80% of the total water used in Europe annually. Around 17 river basin districts, mainly in Spain, Malta, Cyprus, Greece, Portugal Poland and the United Kingdom experienced water stressed conditions during the summer months in 2014. This was due to relatively low net precipitation with large variations within and between years combined with their inability to draw on more distant water sources, as well as intense tourism activities. In addition, near-shore freshwater aquifers are threatened by seawater intrusion. The situation is worse in summer, when average precipitation is very low and water demand for agriculture and tourism is high. This makes water resource management, particularly on the Mediterranean islands, challenging.   Summer is the period when most water stress occurs. This is due to a combination of factors. Water availability decreases because of hotter and drier conditions, while water abstraction doubles during the summer compared with winter, because people and sectors, such as agriculture and industry, require more freshwater, e.g. for cooling and irrigation. During winter only around 7% of the total area of Europe experiences water stress conditions, whereas this rate reaches 11% in summer. The highest WEI+ for the 2014 summer period was estimated for Spanish and Portuguese islands, Malta, Cyprus (81 %), the Jarft river basin in Poland (67 %) followed by the Segura river basin in Spain (62%).   Across Europe, water abstraction from surface water resources accounts for 58% of total water use, with the remaining 42% coming from ground water. The WEI+ is driven by two important factors: (1) climate, which controls water availability and seasonality in water supply, and (2) water demand, which is largely driven by the population density and related economic activities. Thus, a strong relationship exists between this indicator and water use by economic sectors.   In general, a decrease in water abstraction in Europe has been observed for some economic sectors since the 1990s (Figure 2). In the EU-27 (plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland), the industrial sector has improved its water efficiency, leading to a significant decrease (28%) in water abstraction over this period. Agriculture has achieved a 7% decrease in water abstraction, yet remains the sector with the highest water demand. Water abstraction for electricity has decreased by 11% since the 1990s, indicating a more or less constant trend since 2000. Little improvement has been achieved in water abstraction for public water supply, where there has been only a 3% decrease since the 1990s.      Figure 2. Development of water abstraction across Europe by sector since the 1990s        The long-term vision of the 7th EAP is of an innovative economy in which natural resources are managed sustainably. This includes water resources. However, in the coming years, the consequences of various drivers and pressures including climate change, increasing population and continued urbanisation of floodplain areas will increase the likelihood of flooding, droughts and water scarcity in some regions of Europe. There are many indications that water bodies already under stress are highly susceptible to climate change impacts, and that climate change may hinder attempts to restore some water bodies to good status.   While, efficiency gains in industrial and agricultural water use, as well as in public networks, have been achieved and are likely to continue to improve in the period to 2020, hotspots for water stress conditions are likely to remain. If the area under water stress is to be reduced, additional improvements to water efficiency in all sectors will be needed, but particularly the largest consuming sectors, agriculture and the public water supply. However, water efficiency improvements alone are unlikely to be sufficient to offset all the additional impacts of climate change on water scarcity in the future. It is therefore likely that water stress will continue to increase beyond 2020.   About the indicator   This indicator, commonly known as the WEI+, aims to illustrate water use. It shows the percentage used of the total renewable freshwater resources available. A WEI+ above 20% implies that a water resource is under stress, and more than 40% indicates severe stress and clearly unsustainable use of the resource (Raskin et al., 1997).   WEI+ data are available at fine spatial (e.g. sub-basin or river basin) and temporal (monthly or seasonal) scales to better capture local and seasonal variation in the pressure on renewable freshwater resources. The indicator focuses on water quantity. For some aspects of freshwater quality, see the Surface waters briefing ( AIRS_PO1.9, 2016 ). 1    Data on water use have also been derived from various sources such as WISE 3, EPRT-R, UWWTPs, Eurostat water data which have been integrated in the EEA water accounts production database.

Agricultural land and, to a lesser extent, forests and other semi-natural and natural areas are lost to the development of buildings and other artificial surfaces. This leads to loss of fertile land and affects biodiversity, as it decreases habitats, the living space of important species, and fragments the landscapes that support and connect them. Land occupied by man-made surfaces and dense infrastructure is also a significant source of water, soil and air pollution. The sealing of land by these surfaces can also negatively impact the water balance and increase the frequency and intensity of flooding.Land take is also a matter of land use efficiency and an aspect of a wider land degradation issue, addressed by the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals, particularly goal 15.3 on land.   P olicy targets an  d progress    There is no specific objective in the environmental acquis that matches the 7th EAP objective of sustainable land management, and promotion of no net land take by 2050. However, the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011) states that if we are to reach the state of no net land take by 2050, following a linear path, we would need to reduce land take to an average of 800km 2 per year (for the EU) in the period 20002020. This average figure is used in this briefing as the benchmark to assess progress. In the 20002012 period, for the EU the estimated average annual land take was 888km 2  (EEA, 2016), which is considerably above the level required to achieve the long-term objective of no net land take. However, estimated average annual land take has decreased from 930km 2  per year in the 20002006 period to 845km 2  per year in the subsequent 20062012 period (EEA, 2016).   Based on the average for the EU-28, 52% of all areas that changed to artificial surfaces were arable land or permanent crops in 2006 (47% for the EEA-33) (Figure 1). Pastures and mixed farmland were, on average, the category of land that was the next most taken, representing 26% of the total (27% for the EEA-33), while forests and transitional woodland shrub made up 14% (16% for the EEA-33). As these land cover types are substituted to varying degrees by impervious cover, the provision of important services provided by soils, such as storing and filtering water, and the transformation of nutrients and contaminants deteriorates. This specific issue is discussed in more detail in the soil section of the recent SOER 2015 (The European environment State and outlook 2015; EEA, 2015).    Figure 1. Relative contribution of land-cover categories lost to uptake by urban and other artificial land development (2006-2012), EU         From the perspective of the types of development that occur on the land that is taken, at the EU level the largest area, 32%, was taken by construction sites between 2006 and 2012. These sites represent transitional areas that will turn into some form of urban development in the future. The second largest area, 23%, was taken for industrial and commercial sites. Housing, services and recreation made up 20% of the overall increase in urban and other artificial areas. The proportion of newly created mines, quarries and dumpsites was 18% in the EU-28. Although land take for transport infrastructures is underestimated in the Corine Land Cover dataset, it still covered 7% of the area taken. A similar pattern emerges when looking at all 33 EEA member countries (EEA, 2016).   Land use in Europe is shaped by the links between economic activity, increased mobility and growth in transport infrastructure and a number of other drivers, such as the increasing demand for living space per person. Regional urbanisation rates vary substantially, with coastal and mountainous regions among the most affected because of the increasing demand for artificial surfaces related to transport, recreation and leisure in these areas (see Figure 2).        Figure 2. Spatial development of land take in EEA member and cooperating countries              Data source: EEA,  Spatial development of landtake     As the proportion of land used for production (agriculture, forestry, etc.) in Europe is one of the highest in the world, conflicting land use demands require decisions that involve difficult trade-offs. The decisions on trade-offs between land uses are effectively implemented through spatial planning and land management practice in the individual countries. Although the subsidiarity principle assigns land and urban planning responsibilities to national and regional government, most European policies have a direct or indirect effect on land planning and urban development. Where properly implemented, the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA; EC, 2001) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA; EC, 2014) Directives can improve the consideration of environmental aspects in spatial planning.   The average annual land take between 2000 and 2012 lay above the trajectory required to achieve the long-term goal of no net land take. However, annual land take declined between the 20002006 and 20062012 observation periods. If the amount of land taken reduces significantly during the next observation period, Europe could reach the required trajectory. However, it is uncertain whether a further reduction will take place and at what rate, particularly given the recent period of economic recovery following the economic downturn. The outlook to 2020 therefore remains uncertain.     One way to reduce the rate of land take in future is through the redevelopment of brownfield land. Brownfield sites are derelict and underused or even abandoned former industrial or commercial sites, which may have real or perceived contamination problems (EC, 2012). These sites are mainly found in urban areas of industrialised regions. Redevelopment of brownfield sites gives many environmental advantages: relieving pressure on rural areas and greenfield sites, reducing the costs of pollution, allowing more effective use of energy and natural resources and facilitating economic diversification.Another way to reduce the rate of land take in future is by higher density development, i.e. more buildings or a higher population on a given area of land (EEA, forthcoming).      Country level information    Figure 3 shows the mean annual rate of land take in EEA member and cooperating countries (EEA-39) between 2006 and 2012. The graph ranks countries on the basis of increases in land take as a percentage of the initial artificial land stock in 2006. Perhaps surprisingly, the countries with the highest percentage of land take include thosethatare already highlyurbanised and therefore had an already high initial percentage of artificial land stock in 2006. Countries that enjoyed strong economic growth between 2006 and 2012 also had high levels of land take, indicating the need for further decoupling.    Figure 3. Mean annual land take per EEA-39 country, 20062012, as a percentage of 2006 artificial land          Outlook beyond 2020    If the urban population of Europecontinuesto grow, the pressure to develop on natural and semi-natural land will continue.If the objective of no net land take by 2050 is to be met, new developments in future should increasingly have to either take place on brownfield land or fill in gaps between existing developments (densification), or land take should haveto be compensated for by reclaiming of artificial land back to arable or semi-natural land cover types. Such developments could be driven by establishing incentives for land recycling, e.g. encouraging developers to use brownfield land or encouraging spatial planning that favours increasing urban density. The extent to which land take can be reduced in the longer term will also be influenced by the ability of the EU and individual Member States to coordinate their spatial planning and environmental protection objectives.   About the indicator   The indicator shows the amount of land that is converted from natural and semi-natural areas, including forested and agricultural areas, to artificial surfaces used for urban and economic purposes. It includes areas sealed by the construction of buildings and infrastructure, as well as surface mining, urban green areas and sport and leisure facilities.   The indicator is based on the interpretation of satellite imagery from 1990, 2000, 2006 and 2012 (the most recent). The main dataset (Corine Land Cover) used by the indicator does not map features with an area less than 25ha (5ha for change) and less than 100m across. This leads to the exclusion of small areas of land and small changes due to man-made features, particularly in the peri-urban countryside, and it also means that most land taken by linear transport infrastructure (e.g. roads and railways) is not captured, as it is too narrow to be picked up. On the other hand, land take areas accounted for contain unsealed surfaces such as suburban gardens and other smaller green plots.,    Indicator   Indicatorpast trend    Selected objective to be met by 2020   Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020     Land take   EU     EEA      Keep the rate of land take below 800 km2 on average per year from 20002020 in order to keep on track to achieve the aim of no net land take by 2050  Resource Efficiency Roadmap         The EU annual average land take from 20002012 was above the 800-km2 milestone.

However, the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011) states that if we are to reach the state of no net land take by 2050, following a linear path, we would need to reduce land take to an average of 800km2per year (for the EU) in the period 20002020. This average figure is used in this briefing as the benchmark to assess progress. In the 20002012 period, for the EU the estimated average annual land take was 888km2 (EEA, 2016), which is considerably above the level required to achieve the long-term objective of no net land take. However, estimated average annual land take has decreased from 930km2 per year in the 20002006 period to 845km2 per year in the subsequent 20062012 period (EEA, 2016).

Relative contribution of land-cover categories lost to uptake by urban and other artificial land development (2006-2012), EU  From the perspective of the types of development that occur on the land that is taken, at the EU level the largest area, 32%, was taken by construction sites between 2006 and 2012. These sites represent transitional areas that will turn into some form of urban development in the future. The second largest area, 23%, was taken for industrial and commercial sites. Housing, services and recreation made up 20% of the overall increase in urban and other artificial areas. The proportion of newly created mines, quarries and dumpsites was 18% in the EU-28. Although land take for transport infrastructures is underestimated in the Corine Land Cover dataset, it still covered 7% of the area taken. A similar pattern emerges when looking at all 33 EEA member countries (EEA, 2016). Land use in Europe is shaped by the links between economic activity, increased mobility and growth in transport infrastructure and a number of other drivers, such as the increasing demand for living space per person. Regional urbanisation rates vary substantially, with coastal and mountainous regions among the most affected because of the increasing demand for artificial surfaces related to transport, recreation and leisure in these areas (see Figure 2).  Figure 2. Spatial development of land take in EEA member and cooperating countries    Data source: EEA, Spatial development of landtake As the proportion of land used for production (agriculture, forestry, etc.) in Europe is one of the highest in the world, conflicting land use demands require decisions that involve difficult trade-offs. The decisions on trade-offs between land uses are effectively implemented through spatial planning and land management practice in the individual countries. Although the subsidiarity principle assigns land and urban planning responsibilities to national and regional government, most European policies have a direct or indirect effect on land planning and urban development. Where properly implemented, the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA; EC, 2001) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA; EC, 2014) Directives can improve the consideration of environmental aspects in spatial planning. The average annual land take between 2000 and 2012 lay above the trajectory required to achieve the long-term goal of no net land take. However, annual land take declined between the 20002006 and 20062012 observation periods. If the amount of land taken reduces significantly during the next observation period, Europe could reach the required trajectory. However, it is uncertain whether a further reduction will take place and at what rate, particularly given the recent period of economic recovery following the economic downturn. The outlook to 2020 therefore remains uncertain.  One way to reduce the rate of land take in future is through the redevelopment of brownfield land. Brownfield sites are derelict and underused or even abandoned former industrial or commercial sites, which may have real or perceived contamination problems (EC, 2012). These sites are mainly found in urban areas of industrialised regions. Redevelopment of brownfield sites gives many environmental advantages: relieving pressure on rural areas and greenfield sites, reducing the costs of pollution, allowing more effective use of energy and natural resources and facilitating economic diversification.Another way to reduce the rate of land take in future is by higher density development, i.e. more buildings or a higher population on a given area of land (EEA, forthcoming).  Country level information Figure 3 shows the mean annual rate of land take in EEA member and cooperating countries (EEA-39) between 2006 and 2012. The graph ranks countries on the basis of increases in land take as a percentage of the initial artificial land stock in 2006. Perhaps surprisingly, the countries with the highest percentage of land take include thosethatare already highlyurbanised and therefore had an already high initial percentage of artificial land stock in 2006. Countries that enjoyed strong economic growth between 2006 and 2012 also had high levels of land take, indicating the need for further decoupling. Figure 3. Mean annual land take per EEA-39 country, 20062012, as a percentage of 2006 artificial land  Outlook beyond 2020 If the urban population of Europecontinuesto grow, the pressure to develop on natural and semi-natural land will continue.If the objective of no net land take by 2050 is to be met, new developments in future should increasingly have to either take place on brownfield land or fill in gaps between existing developments (densification), or land take should haveto be compensated for by reclaiming of artificial land back to arable or semi-natural land cover types. Such developments could be driven by establishing incentives for land recycling, e.g. encouraging developers to use brownfield land or encouraging spatial planning that favours increasing urban density. The extent to which land take can be reduced in the longer term will also be influenced by the ability of the EU and individual Member States to coordinate their spatial planning and environmental protection objectives. About the indicator The indicator shows the amount of land that is converted from natural and semi-natural areas, including forested and agricultural areas, to artificial surfaces used for urban and economic purposes. It includes areas sealed by the construction of buildings and infrastructure, as well as surface mining, urban green areas and sport and leisure facilities. The indicator is based on the interpretation of satellite imagery from 1990, 2000, 2006 and 2012 (the most recent). The main dataset (Corine Land Cover) used by the indicator does not map features with an area less than 25ha (5ha for change) and less than 100m across. This leads to the exclusion of small areas of land and small changes due to man-made features, particularly in the peri-urban countryside, and it also means that most land taken by linear transport infrastructure (e.g. roads and railways) is not captured, as it is too narrow to be picked up. On the other hand, land take areas accounted for contain unsealed surfaces such as suburban gardens and other smaller green plots."
"land-recycling-helps-europe  Land recycling helps Europe to maintain its land resource  Land degradation and taking land for urban development threaten critical ecosystem services, including provision of food and water, climate regulation and recreation. A new report, by the European Environment Agency (EEA), shows how land recycling, such as reusing neglected sites and turning roads or parking lots to green spaces or residential areas, can have positive impacts on the environment and support Europe’s transition towards a circular and green economy.   The EEA report  ‘Land recycling in Europe’   presents approaches to measuring the extent and impacts of redevelopment and densification of previously developed land, either with direct economic aim, such as building housing, or with the aim of upgrading its ecological status, such as creating green urban areas or cleaning up soil pollution.   On average, land recycling has increased in Europe but the levels remain low compared to land take, the report shows. Based on Copernicus satellite data, land recycling as a share of total land consumption across EEA member and cooperating countries (EEA-39) has increased from about 2.0-2.2 % in 1990-2000 to about 2.7-2.9 % in 2006-2012. However, the rates vary considerably across countries.   Land is a finite resource with many demands, and land take and soil sealing have long been a cause for environmental concern. From 2006 to 2012, taking land for development in Europe (EEA-39) continued at an average annual rate of 1065 km 2 . However, land in urban areas is sealed and reused in small parcels and often remain undetectable by land take monitoring. Analysis of land recycling and soil sealing needs more detailed data. For example, measured by high resolution imperviousness data, during 2006-2009 soil sealing increased at an average annual rate of 1454 km 2 .   When soil is covered with an impervious surface, such as tarmac, the functioning of the ecosystem is disrupted, impacting nutrient and water cycles as well as the soil’s ability to supply ecosystem services, including everything from provision of food and water to climate regulation and space for recreation.   By recycling land, the report showcases, it is possible to reduce new land take and also to improve the ecological status of previously developed land. Land recycling, hence, can be key to maintaining and developing green spaces that are important for ecosystem services. Recycling land can also make an important contribution to achieving a circular economy, in which maximum value is derived from limited resources, in this case land.   The report also compares different models of land recycling based on a life-cycle assessment of the environmental impacts of developing and using a land area. The assessment shows that bringing previously developed land back to more efficient use or improving its ecological state have greater positive impacts than turning, for example, agricultural land into urban development.   copernicus green economy circular economy land take land recycling urban planning soil sealing corine land cover urban,The EEA report ‘Land recycling in Europe’  presents approaches to measuring the extent and impacts of redevelopment and densification of previously developed land, either with direct economic aim, such as building housing, or with the aim of upgrading its ecological status, such as creating green urban areas or cleaning up soil pollution.

"assessment-1  Primary energy consumption by fuel    In 2014, primary energy consumption in the EU-28 countries amounted to 1 507 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe), 1.6 % above the 2020 target. Between 2005 and 2014, primary energy consumption in the EU-28 countries decreased by 12 % due to energy efficiency improvements, the increase of the share of energy from hydro, wind and solar photovoltaics, the economic recession and climate warming. Based on EEA preliminary estimates, in 2015 EU-28 primary energy consumption was 1525 Mtoe. This represents a 1.2 % increase compared with 2014.    Fossil fuels (including non-renewable waste) continued to dominate primary energy consumption in the EU-28, but as a proportion of total primary energy consumption, they fell from 77.8 % in 2005 to 71.6 % in 2014. The proportion of renewable energy sources almost doubled over the same period, from 7.1 % in 2005 to 13.4 % in 2014, increasing at an average annual rate of 5.8 % per year between 2005 and 2014. The proportion of nuclear energy in primary energy consumption was 15.0 % in 2014.   growth rates ghg retrospective energy consumption energy fuels     CSI CSI029 ENER ENER026 029 026, Primary energy consumption in the EU-28 increased by 9.1 % from 1 569 Mtoe in 1990 to 1 713 Mtoe in 2005. Between 2005 and 2014, primary energy consumption in the EU-28 countries decreased by 12.0 %, reaching 1 507 Mtoe in 2014. Various factors contributed to this decrease in primary energy consumption, in particular energy efficiency improvements, the increase of the proportion of energy from hydro, wind and solar photovoltaics, the economic recession and changing climate conditions [1]. Under the Energy Efficiency Directive, the EU has set a target of limiting primary energy consumption to no more than 1 483 Mtoe by 2020. In 2014, the EU was below the linear pathway between 2005 levels and the 2020 target. The sum of all 2020 targets for primary energy consumption by the EU-28 (updated target as notified in the NEEAPs 2014 or in a separate notification to the European Commission in 2015; status October 2015) was equal to 1527 Mtoe. This is 44Mtoe (3 %) higher than the EU target for primary energy consumption of 1483Mtoe. Based on preliminary EEA estimates, in 2015, primary energy consumption in the EU-28 was1525 Mtoe, 1.2 % higher than in 2014 but still below the linear pathway towards the 2020 target. The proportion of coal and lignite in EU-28 primary energy consumption has remained relatively stable since 2005, and was 18.5 % in 2005 and 17.7 % in 2014. Since 2005, the absolute consumption of coal in the EU has decreased by 16 % (1.9 % per year). Coal is mostly used for electricity generation and the low coal price compared with gas and the low carbon price in the EU-ETS mean that coal-based electricity production has low marginal costs such that it is still competitive compared with gas-based production for existing installations (see below). The proportion of natural gas in EU-28 primary energy consumption decreased from 25.1 % in 2005 to 21.9 % in 2014. Since 2005, the absolute consumption of gas in the EU decreased by 23 % (2.9 % per year). This is partly the result of the increase in renewable energy. The increase of renewable electricity has had a significant impact on the operations of gas-fired power plants, which ran continuously (base-load) in the past, but which now tend to operate during peak-load only, thereby reducing yearly operation hours. The consumption of natural gas for heating in the residential and service sectors was influenced by weather conditions (relatively warm years) and income levels. The proportion of oil (crude oil and petroleum products) in EU-28 primary energy consumption decreased from 33.8 % in 2005 to 31.1 % in 2014. Since 2005, the absolute consumption of fossil oil in the EU decreased by 19 % (2.3 % per year). Several factors contributed to this decline: the increase in the use of biofuels in the transport sector, high oil prices for some periods within the 2005-2014 observation period, the economic downturn and energy efficiency improvements in cars, partly driven by EU regulations onCO2 emissions from cars and vans. The proportion of nuclear energy in EU-28 primary energy consumption remained stable at 15 % in 2005 and 2014. Since 2005, the absolute consumption of nuclear energy in the EU decreased by 12 % (1.4 % per year). This is because several old nuclear power plants have been shut down (in Bulgaria in 2002 and 2006, in Lithuania in 2004 and 2009, and in Slovakia in 2006 and 2008), and more recently, eight nuclear power plants were shut down in Germany, in 2011, in reaction to the Fukushima accident in Japan. The proportion of renewable energy in EU-28 primary energy consumption increased from around 7.1 % in 2005 to 13.4 % in 2014. Since 2005, the absolute consumption of renewable energy in the EU increased by 66 % (9.6 % year). This growth was stimulated by national and European policies to promote renewable energy, such as feed-in tariffs and premiums, obligations for electricity producers, obligations for renewable energy in transport fuel etc. In recent years, various EU governments have reduced support levels for renewable energy, partly in response to the decreasing costs of renewable energy technologies and higher than expected growth (and thus support costs), but also in response to increasing government budget deficits following the economic recession [2]. Although primary energy consumption in the EU declined after 2005, it increased in non-EU EEA countries, from 109 Mtoe in 2005 to 151 Mtoe in 2014. The main reason for the difference in the trend for these countries is the large increase in primary energy consumption in Turkey (+4.3 % per year) and, to a lesser extent, in Norway (+0.9 % per year). In Turkey, the trend is driven by strong economic and population growth, while in Norway developments may be driven by growth in certain industrial activities such as the chemical industry. In 2014, the contribution of different fuels in primary energy consumption in non-EU EEA countries was quite different to that in the EU-28. In particular, nuclear energy accounts for a significant proportion of the EU-28 energy mix (15.0 %), while it is absent in the non-EU EEA countries considered here. Renewables account for a have a larger proportion of primary energy consumption in the non-EU EEA countries (20.1 %, compared to 13.4 % in the EU-28). In 2014, the proportion of fossil fuels (including non-renewable waste) was 71.6 % for the EU-28 and 80.5 % in the non-EU EEA. Fuel switching has implications on how dependent Europe is on imported fuels (please see ENER036 for a discussion on the EU's dependency on imported fuels). To achieve the EU's 20 % energy efficiency target by 2020, individual EU countries have set their own indicative national energy efficiency targets (Council Directive 2013/12/EU). All EU-28 Member States have set targets for primary energy consumption. In 2014, 25 Member States had managed to reduce or limit their primary energy consumption increase to levels below the linear pathways drawn between their 2005 levels and their 2020 targets. Three Member States had not achieved sufficient savings: Estonia, Malta and Sweden [3].  [1] Energy produced from hydro, wind and solar-photovoltaics is measured as energy produced in final form (electricity), as opposed to electricity generation from non-renewable sources for which conversion losses occur. Hence, an increase in the share of energy production from these sources leads to a reduction of primary energy consumption. [2] Held et al., 2014. Design features of support schemes for renewable electricity. [3] EEA, 2015. Trends and projections in Europe 2016 (forthcoming)."
"assessment-1  Consumption of meat, dairy, fish and seafood   Consumption of meat per person increased by 2 %, milk (excluding butter) by 6 %, and fish and seafood by 13 % between 1995 and 2011. The increase took place before 2008, while the consumption of these food categories has stabilised or slightly decreased since then. This general trend, however, masks a change in the types of meat and fish consumed. Within the meat category, consumption of beef has fallen by 13 %, while consumption of poultry products has increased by 23 %. Within the fish and seafood category, the main change is a growth in the consumption of freshwater fish by 95 % over the same period.   Both bovine meat and cheese lead, on average, to significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions than pig or poultry meat per kilogram. With the decrease in consumption of bovine meat and the simultaneous increase in consumption of cheese and poultry, no  significant environmental benefits related to these changes are expected.    consumption SCP SCP020 020,Consumption of meat, dairy, and fish and seafood products increased gradually between 1995 and 2008, leading to associated changes in the environmental impacts of diets. After 2008, the consumption of these food categories seems to have stabilised. Overall, meat consumption per person increased by around 2 % between 1995 and 2011. However, the composition of meat consumption has changed, both per capita and in terms of overall quantities. The average citizen in the EU-28 ate 2.3 kg less beef in 2011 than in 1995 (a 13 % decrease), but 4.0 kg more poultry (a 23 % increase) (Figure 1). Pork consumption remained relatively stable. Pork and cheese, followed by poultry, are the main sources of protein consumption from animal based foods in Europe (Figure 1). Regarding dairy products, about 6 % more milk products (excluding butter) were consumed in 2011 than in 1995 (Figure 2) although actual direct consumption of whole milk fell by about 14 kg (or approximately 14 litres) per person. This is counter-balanced by an increased consumption of cheese and cream(Figure 1). Different meat and dairy products also lead to significantly different environmental impacts. For example, (intensively farmed) beef leads to seven times the greenhouse gas emissions, a six times greater nature occupancy and a four times higher eutrophication loading than an equal amount of poultry meat. Pork lies somewhere between the two for almost all impact categories (Weidema et al., 2008). It should also be noted that although poultry generally leads to lower environmental pressures than beef, animal welfare issues related to intensive methods of poultry rearing should also be taken into account, particularly in the light of growing poultry consumption. Secondly, beef from extensive cattle farming can have positive biodiversity effects in upland and nutrient poor areas of Europe. The production of dairy products such as cheese and milk also leads to significant environmental impacts. Cheese production causes impacts at a similar scale to beef per kg consumed. As such, the 28 % increase in cheese consumption (an extra 3.8 kg per capita in 2011 compared with 1995) more than offsets the environmental benefits from the decrease in consumption of beef described above. On average, Europeans ate about 2.7 kg more fish and seafood in 2011 than in 1995. About 1.8 kg of this increase was as a result of the consumption of freshwater fish, whichincreased by 95 %. The remaining 0.9 kg of increased fish and seafood consumption comprised crustaceans (e.g. prawns and mussels), cephalopods (e.g. squid) and pelagic (bottom dwelling) fish. EU imports of the majority of fish and crustacean products, mostly processed fish, increased by 44 % to nearly 5 million tonnes between 2000 and 2010. Aquaculture in Europe accounts for approximately 20 % of fish production. As aquaculture production in the EU-28 has been steady since 1995, increasing consumption has been met by imports (EEA, 2014). It is difficult to assess the environmental implications of the increasing consumption of fish and seafood in the EU as these are dependent on which fish species are being consumed, the changing status of the stock of that species and the fishing methods used. Different fishing methods can have significantly different environmental impacts. Across Europe, around 58 % of the assessed commercial fish stocks are designated as being in Good Environmental Status, but this varies considerably between regional seas (EEA CSI 032). Given the relevance and implications to human health of meat, dairy, fish and seafood consumption, the potential environmental and health co-benefits as well as the related conflicts and trade-offs should be explored when considering (policy) options to reduce the environmental pressures of food consumption. Reducing red meat consumption and a shift to other sources of protein has the potential to reduce the EU's environmental footprint while also delivering health benefits (EuroHealthNet, 2013).The average protein available for consumption through meat, fish and dairy products was 61 g/person/day in 2011, while 104 g/person/day was accounted for by plant based proteins (FAOSTAT, 2016). It is challenging to compare these numbers directly with dietary recommendations. The WHO and FAO define a safe minimum level of protein intake of 0.83 g/kg per day of both animal based and plant based food to meet the requirements of 97.5 % of the healthy adult population (WHO, 2007). This gives a rough indication that average protein intake across the whole EU population is much higher than the minimum for a healthy life. However, recommended protein intake also depends on protein quality, and the data on the amounts for protein available for consumption also include food that is wasted and thus are higher than what is actually consumed. It is important to note that consumption levels within these food groups vary greatly between European countries. Absolute levels of meat consumption per capita across the EU-28 also differ, ranging from 53 kg/year in Bulgaria to 106 kg/year in Austria in 2011."
"innovations-across-europe-lead-way  Innovations across Europe lead way towards sustainable future  Achieving the European Union’s long-term objective of shifting to a sustainable, low-carbon future will be a massive undertaking.

"executive-summary-1  Executive summary  Progress of the European Union and its Member States towards 2020 climate and energy targets.  ghg emissions   The 2016 edition of the European Environment Agency (EEA) Trends and projections in Europe report confirms that the European Union (EU) is well on track to meet its climate and energy targets for 2020. Despite a slight setback in 2015 concerning greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy efficiency, GHG emissions have already decreased below the 20% reduction target; renewable energy use is growing faster than initially planned by Member States in order to achieve the 20% target level; and energy consumption is decreasing at a pace that will be sufficient to reach the 2020 energy efficiency target (see Figure ES.1).   According to preliminary estimates, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions slightly increased in 2015. These increases follow large reductions in 2014, due to an exceptionally warm winter that year that was responsible for particularly low energy demand for heating.   Policies are playing an important role in driving the overall EU trends observed since 2005, in particular through a continued increase in renewable energy use. However, the transport sector in general is a laggard, both in terms of reducing GHG emissions and achieving the 10% sectoral target for renewables by 2020.         Figure 1 EU progress towards 2020 climate and energy targets             Note: For renewable energy, the figure represents the trend in the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption since 2005. The 2020 renewable energy target corresponds to a share of 20%.     The 2020 target on energy efficiency was defined as a 20% saving in energy consumption compared to baseline projections. This is equivalent to a 13% reduction of primary energy consumption (or an 8% reduction in final energy consumption) from 2005 levels. The figure represents the relative change in primary energy consumption since 2005.     The 2020 target on greenhouse gas emissions corresponds to a 20% reduction from 1990 levels. The trends and projections represented on the figure correspond to relative changes in emissions compared to 1990 levels. The projections are presented in the with existing measures scenario, which reflects currently adopted policies and measures.

Figure 2 Progress of member States towards 2020 climate and energy targets in 2014           Note: The colours indicate whether countries are considered on track or not towards their 2020 climate and energy targets.     For greenhouse gases, orange means that 2014 emissions covered by the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) were above the 2014 national ESD target. Yellow means that projected ESD emissions in the with existing measures scenario for 2020 are above the 2020 national ESD target.     For renewable energy, orange means that the 2014 share of energy from renewable sources (RES) in gross final energy consumption was below the indicative level from the Renewable Energy Directive. Yellow means that the 2014 RES share was below the indicative level from the national action plan from 2010.     For energy efficiency, orange means that the 2014 consumption in primary energy was above a linear indicative trajectory between the 2005 level and the 2020 national target.     Further methodological details on how progress is measured are provided in Annexes 1, 2 and 3.     Source: National information reported by Member States to the EEA, the European Commission and Eurostat. See Chapters 3, 5 and 7 for further details, as well as Annexes 1, 2 and 3 for information on data and methodology.       The report also uses official data for 2014 to look at the progress of Member States towards their individual objectives for 2020 (see Figure ES.2). Here progress is mixed: while the EU is on track, the situation differs between Member States.     22 Member States are on track to meet their 2020 GHG targets under the Effort Sharing Decision, which cover national emissions from sectors outside the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). All except Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg project that their GHG emissions will be kept or reduced below their national targets in 2020, with the current set of policies and measures in place. Malta did not reach its 2014 ESD target.   22 Member States are on track to reach their 2020 renewable energy targets: all except France, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal used more renewable energy than the levels indicated in their national action plans for the year 2014. The Netherlands did not reach the minimum level indicated in the Renewable Energy Directive.   25 Member States (all except Estonia, Malta and Sweden) are on track to meet their 2020 energy efficiency targets, on the basis of their consumption of primary energy in 2014. However, some Member States show a lack of ambition with regard to reducing or limiting their energy consumption: the 28 Member States self-defined 2020 targets for primary energy consumption do not amount to a level in line with the reduction target determined at the EU level.     A total of 17 Member States are on track to deliver on their national targets in all three areas. This is an improvement on 2014, when the figure was 13. However, for the first time that this analysis is made, one Member State (Malta) is experiencing difficulties in staying on track in any of the three areas.   EU progress towards 2030 climate and energy targets    Although the EU is expected to achieve its 2020 targets, current efforts need to be stepped up to achieve more ambitious longer term objectives. For example, while projections show further decreases in EU GHG emissions beyond 2020, Member States project that the pace of these reductions will slow down. The reductions currently planned fall short of the 40% reduction target for 2030.   Maintaining the current pace of renewable energy deployment across Europe would enable the EU to achieve the target of sourcing at least 27% of its gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources by 2030. However, this may not happen without additional effort, because regulatory changes affect investors confidence in renewables, and market barriers still prevent new competitors from easily entering the renewable energy sector.   Concerning energy efficiency, continuing the current trends in energy consumption would be sufficient to achieve the 27% target for energy efficiency in 2030. This would only require a somewhat limited change in the EUs energy system. Achieving the 2030 targets nevertheless requires not only the effective implementation of energy efficiency measures, but also a rapid change in consumer behaviour.   Policy proposals are currently under discussion between Member States and at the European Parliament in order to achieve the EUs 2030 objectives under the climate and energy framework and the Energy Union Framework Strategy. These include a revision of the EU ETS, new binding national targets on GHG emissions for the period from 2021 to 2030 under the Effort Sharing Regulation, and the integration of land use and forestry in the policy framework. The Commission is also scheduled to table proposals for revising the Renewable Energy and the Energy Efficiency Directives, as well as rules for the electricity market.   A new governance system is also being developed in order to ensure that these policies and measures adequately support the transition to a low-carbon, competitive EU economy. The proposed new governance includes (1) a structured, political dialogue between the Commission, Member States and other EU institutions; (2) streamlined planning, reporting and monitoring across the energy and climate fields; and (3) stronger regional cooperation.   Outlook for greenhouse gas trends in 2050   The 2016 analysis of progress towards long-term decarbonisation targets in the EU has not changed since the 2015 assessment: although the EU and its Member States are making good progress towards their short-term goals on climate and energy, they will have to intensify their efforts considerably to meet longer-term energy and decarbonisation objectives for 2050. The pace of GHG emission reductions after 2020 should actually increase in order to achieve targets, rather than slow down as is currently projected by Member States. Assuming the necessary emission cuts required to achieve the 2030 target actually take place, an even deeper reduction would still need to be achieved between the 2030 target level (40% below 1990 levels) and the EU objective for 2050 (at least 80% below 1990 levels). This reduction will have to be two to three times greater than the decrease from current levels necessary to meet the 2030 target, which is itself greater than that achieved since 1990. In short, ambition levels need to be stepped up.   As underlined in the EEA report,The European environment - state and outlook 2015, achieving the EUs long-term decarbonisation objective can take place only in the context of a major transformation of the EUs socio-technical systems such as the energy, food, mobility and urban systems. As the effects of policies and measures often take time to materialise, action aimed at achieving the long-term targets cannot be delayed. Member States tend to prioritise low-cost mitigation measures, but they should also take into consideration the long-term mitigation potential of other measures, including those that are often postponed because of high current costs or other difficulties related to their implementation. Investments in these measures often make economic sense, even in the short term, as they significantly contribute to the generation of learning effects and thereby foster future cost reductions.

The ETC/ACM is a consortium of European institutes that assist the EEA in its support to European Union (EU) policy in the field of air pollution and climate change mitigation.

Despite a slight setback in 2015 concerning greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy efficiency, GHG emissions have already decreased below the 20% reduction target; renewable energy use is growing faster than initially planned by Member States in order to achieve the 20% target level; and energy consumption is decreasing at a pace that will be sufficient to reach the 2020 energy efficiency target (see Figure ES.1). According to preliminary estimates, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions slightly increased in 2015. These increases follow large reductions in 2014, due to an exceptionally warm winter that year that was responsible for particularly low energy demand for heating. Policies are playing an important role in driving the overall EU trends observed since 2005, in particular through a continued increase in renewable energy use. However, the transport sector in general is a laggard, both in terms of reducing GHG emissions and achieving the 10% sectoral target for renewables by 2020.  Figure 1 EU progress towards 2020 climate and energy targets   Note: For renewable energy, the figure represents the trend in the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption since 2005. The 2020 renewable energy target corresponds to a share of 20%. The 2020 target on energy efficiency was defined as a 20% saving in energy consumption compared to baseline projections. This is equivalent to a 13% reduction of primary energy consumption (or an 8% reduction in final energy consumption) from 2005 levels. The figure represents the relative change in primary energy consumption since 2005. The 2020 target on greenhouse gas emissions corresponds to a 20% reduction from 1990 levels. The trends and projections represented on the figure correspond to relative changes in emissions compared to 1990 levels. The projections are presented in the with existing measures scenario, which reflects currently adopted policies and measures.

Figure 2 Progress of member States towards 2020 climate and energy targets in 2014   Note: The colours indicate whether countries are considered on track or not towards their 2020 climate and energy targets. For greenhouse gases, orange means that 2014 emissions covered by the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) were above the 2014 national ESD target. Yellow means that projected ESD emissions in the with existing measures scenario for 2020 are above the 2020 national ESD target. For renewable energy, orange means that the 2014 share of energy from renewable sources (RES) in gross final energy consumption was below the indicative level from the Renewable Energy Directive. Yellow means that the 2014 RES share was below the indicative level from the national action plan from 2010. For energy efficiency, orange means that the 2014 consumption in primary energy was above a linear indicative trajectory between the 2005 level and the 2020 national target.

The report also uses official data for 2014 to look at the progress of Member States towards their individual objectives for 2020 (see Figure ES.2). Here progress is mixed: while the EU is on track, the situation differs between Member States.  22 Member States are on track to meet their 2020 GHG targets under the Effort Sharing Decision, which cover national emissions from sectors outside the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). All except Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg project that their GHG emissions will be kept or reduced below their national targets in 2020, with the current set of policies and measures in place. Malta did not reach its 2014 ESD target. 22 Member States are on track to reach their 2020 renewable energy targets: all except France, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal used more renewable energy than the levels indicated in their national action plans for the year 2014.

"assessment-1  Efficiency of conventional thermal electricity and heat production   Between 2005 and 2014, the efficiency of public conventional thermal power plants more or less stabilised in the EU-28 at around 48 %. In the non-EU EEA countries, this efficiency dropped to 44 %.   The efficiency of electricity and heat production from autoproducer conventional thermal power plants in the EU and non-EU EEA countries decreased by about 2.5 percentage points, from 59.4% in 2005 to 56.9% in 2014.   electricity heat energy   ENER ENER019 019, Between 2005 and 2014, the average efficiency of public electricity and heat conventional thermal power plants stabilised at around 48 % (see Figure 1). In 2014, the figure was 47.6 %. In the non-EU EEA countries such as Iceland, Norway and Turkey, the average efficiency of public conventional thermal power plants decreased from 45.9 % in 2005 to 41.8 % in 2014 [1]. In the EU-28, the increase in efficiency between 2005 and 2010 is explained by the increased use of natural gas-fired power plants with higher efficiencies and the decreased use of coal, lignite and nuclear fuels (coal, lignite and nuclear power plants have relatively lower efficiencies) (see ENER038). After 2010, the average efficiency of public electricity and heat conventional thermal power plants decreased because of the increased use of coal, lignite and biomass fuels, and the decreased use of natural gas fuels. About half of the decrease in efficiency between 2010 and 2014 can be attributed to the changes in fuel mix (see ENER038). In 2014, the average efficiency for district heating conventional thermal plants in the EU-28 was 82.6 %, the same as in 2005 (See Figure 2). The efficiency of district heating conventional thermal power plants from Iceland decreased from 82.9 % in 2005 to 77.2 % in 2014.  The average efficiency of conventional autoproducers thermal power plants in the EU decreased by 3 percentage points between 2005 and 2014, from 60 % in 2005 to 57 % in 2014 (see figure 3). This is largely explained by substantial reductions in efficiency in France, Spain and a number of smaller EU countries in that period. In France, for example, the heat output of autoproducers decreased by 80 % between 2005 and 2014, while electricity output decreased by just 37 %. The total efficiency for autoproducers in France dropped by 20 percentage points, from 63 % to 43 %, over the same period. The situation in France may be attributed to a change in the allocation of energy use for heat production between autoproducers and district heating in France. In 2014, the three countries with the highest efficiencies in electricity and heat production from public conventional thermal power stations were Sweden, Latvia and Lithuania (see Figure 4a). The difference between the countries with the highest and lowest efficiencies was over 40 percentage points. This was mainly caused by differences in the fuel mix used in electricity production (see ENER 038). Between 2005 and 2014, the two countries that registered an efficiency improvement of more than 9 percentage points were Malta and Lithuania (see Figure 4b). The installed capacity was partly decommissioned in both countries; the efficiency improvements came as a result of increased electricity imports. Decreases in efficiency between 2005 and 2014 were seen in 14 EEA countries, with the largest decreases occurring in Norway, Portugal and Spain (between 5 and 10 percentage points). In 2013, 64 % of district heating used in the EU-28 was recycled heat from electricity production, waste-to-energy plants and industrial processes, with the rest being generated directly from fossil fuels and renewables (Euroheat&Power, 2015). Such an increase in the proportion of total heat coming from district heating will have significant environmental benefits. In 2014, the three countries with the highest efficiencies in district heating were Finland, Hungary and the Czech Republic (see Figure 5a). Between 2005 and 2014, the three countries with the greatest efficiency improvements in district heating from conventional thermal power stations seemed to be Belgium, France and Hungary (see Figure 5b). Heat production from district heating more than quadrupled in France in 2012; new and more efficient installations contributed to this increase in efficiency. Decreases in efficiency between 2005 and 2014 were seen in eight EEA countries, with the largest decreases occurring in Romania, the Netherlands and Estonia. In Romania for example, some plants operate at low capacity factors. Because some of the installations are old, the proper redistribution of the thermal agent throughout the network, which should occur when customers disconnect from the network permanently, may not take place. In these cases, the plants operate suboptimally. In 2014, the three countries with the highest efficiencies in autoproducer conventional thermal power stations were Luxembourg, Finland and Latvia, with efficiencies more than twice as high as efficiencies in the United Kingdom. France and Romania also showed low efficiencies (see Figure 6a). Between 2005 and 2014, the three countries with the highest efficiency improvements in autoproducer conventional thermal power stations seemed to have been Bulgaria, Cyprus and Ireland (see Figure 6b). Decreases in efficiency between 2005 and 2014 were seen in 12 EEA countries, with the largest decreases occurring in France, Spain and the Czech Republic.  [1]Efficiencies of public conventional thermal power plants from non-EU EEA countries could on be derived from the energy statistics for Iceland, Norway and Turkey."
"assessment-2  Progress on energy efficiency in Europe    Between 1990 and 2014, final energy efficiency increased by 28 % in the EU-28 countries at an annual average rate of 1.4 % per year. This was driven by improvements in the industrial sector (+1.8 % per year) and households (+1.7 % per year). Improvement rates were lower in the service sector (+1 % per year) and the transport sector (+0.9 % per year). Half of the efficiency gains achieved through technological innovation in the household sector have been offset by an increasing number of electrical appliances being used and larger homes.    building codes energy energy efficiency   ENER ENER037 037, In 2014, final energy consumption reached 1 061 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in the EU-28. Buildings (households and services) accounted for approximately 38 % of final energy consumption in 2014 (while households accounted for 25 % and services for 13 % (+3% compared to 1990)), transport 33 % (+7 % compared to 1990) followed by industry with 26% (-8 % compared with 1990) and agriculture3 % (-1 % compared with 1990). The total floor area of buildings represented approximately 25 billion m2 in the EU in 2014. The residential sector represents about 75 % of the total floor area. At the EU level, the average annual specific consumption per m2 for all types of building was around 203 kWh/m2 in 2014. Non-residential buildings are on average 70 % more energy intensive than residential buildings (293kWh/m2 compared with 175kWh/m2).  Energy efficiency improvements in households   Household energy consumption per dwelling (normal climate) reached 1.4 toe per dwelling (or 175 kWh/m2) in 2014. There are large discrepancies between countries in the level of consumption per dwelling, ranging from less than 0.8 toe per dwelling in Malta, Portugal, Bulgaria and Spain to around 2 toe per dwelling in Sweden, Germany, Austria, Croatia or Finland (see Figure 2). Space heating accounted for 68 % of the energy consumption of households in 2014, although this figure decreased from 70 % in 2005 and 72 % in 1990. Electrical appliances and water heating each accounted for 12 % of the energy consumption of households in 2014. The energy consumption of electrical appliances increased by 3 % compared to 1990. In addition, cooking accounts for 5 % and lighting 2 % of household energy consumption. Air conditioning only accounts for 0.4 % of household energy consumption, but 2.9 % of the specific electricity from households [1] (down from 0.7 % in 1990). Space heating energy consumption has decreased by 0.3 % per year since 1990, with a decreasing average annual rate of -1.4 % per year from 2005 to 2014 compared with +0.4 % per year from 1990 to 2005. The total floor area of dwellings increased by 1.4 % per year over the same period, much more than the number of dwellings, which increased by 1 % per year. As a result, the energy consumption of space heating per m2 has decreased by 1.7 % per year since 1990, more rapidly than space heating consumption per dwelling (-1.2 % per year), reaching 118 kWh/m2 in 2014[2] (Figure 3). Significant disparities exist between EU countries, with space heating energy consumption ranging from less than 80 kWh/m2 in southern countries where there are lower heating needs (Spain, Bulgaria, Greece, Luxembourg and Portugal) to more than 170 kWh/m2 in colder countries such as Poland, Latvia or Finland[3]. Energy efficiency improvements for space heating occurred as a result of the better thermal performance of buildings, which was in turn encouraged by mandatory efficiency standards for new buildings, an increase in the penetration of condensing boilers and heat pumps, and the thermal retrofitting of existing dwellings. Standards for new buildings have contributed to reducing the average unit consumption of the dwelling stock for the EU as a whole by 0.5 % per year on average between 1990 and 2014, which represents about half of the total savings for household space heating (see Figure 4). At the EU level, the energy consumed by households on air conditioning increased by around 7.6 % per year on average since 1990 and by 2.7 % per year since 2005. More and more dwellings have air conditioning: up from 0.8 % in 1990 to 1.5 % in 2005 and 2.4 % in 2014. Across the EU, the average energy consumed on air conditioning per m2 has been increasing by 1.3 % per year on average since 1990 (see Figure 5). Indeed, over the same period, the percentage of dwellings with air conditioning increased in Italy (from 11 % to 37 %), in Spain (from 5 % in 1990 and 15 % in 2000 to 60 % in 2013) and by almost 80 % in Cyprus and Malta. In the Netherlands, Slovenia and Bulgaria, the diffusion of air conditioning is more recent but equally significant, increasing from around 1-2 % in 2000 to 15 %, 21 % and 31 % of dwellings in 2014, respectively. The percentage coverage of the most efficient cooling systems has increased significantly across Europe, where newly sold A++ and A+++ air conditioners increased from 11 % in 2011 to 27 % in 2014[4]. This increase was driven by the new Energy Label for air conditioning, which has been applied since January 2013[5]. As a result of these more efficient air conditioners, at EU level, the specific consumption per m2 with air conditioning has decreased since 2002. The energy consumption of electrical appliances increased on average by 0.7 % per year between 1990 and 2014. This electricity consumption is driven by the increasing amount of household equipment (multi-equipment, IT equipment etc.), but is offset by technical progress due to the diffusion of more and more efficient equipment. For large appliances, the improvement in energy efficiency results from technical improvements driven by EU Directives on mandatory labelling for all large appliances and lighting, and on minimum energy standards for cold appliances as well as from voluntary agreements with the European Committee of Domestic Equipment Manufacturers (CECED). As a result, the share of the most efficient appliances (A+, A++ or more recently A+++) has increased significantly: from 9 % in 2005 to 98 % in 2014 for refrigerators (of which 27 % were A++/A+++ in 2014), and from 18 % to 95 % for washing machines (of which 43 % were A+++ in 2014)[6]. Lighting consumption per dwelling has decreased by 1.2 % per year since 1990, as a result of the deployment of efficient lighting equipment. The number of televisions has almost doubled in the EU over the same period, with around 1.9 televisions per households in 2014. At the same time, the specific consumption of television increased by approximately 0.6 % per year since 1990. Todays high-definition equipment, such as liquid crystal display (LCD) and plasma flat-screen models, consume less energy but are larger. The relationship between screen size and average active mode power consumption of a television is an obvious one: the larger the screen, the greater the power consumption (Figure 6). Figure 7 presents the decomposition of energy consumption per dwelling for the EU as a whole, which decreased by 1 % per year between 1990 and 2014. This was the result of two opposing factors. On the one hand, the household energy consumption per dwelling increased by 1.2 % per year between 1990 and 2014 because of a greater number of appliances per dwelling and lager homes. On the other hand, energy savings, mainly resulting from energy efficiency improvements in the various end-uses, contributed to a decrease in household energy consumption of 2.1 % per year over the same period. Ambitious requirements for energy performance in buildings have been introduced in EU countries to encourage the renovation of buildings to nearly zero energy building (nZEB) levels. By 2020, all new buildings in the EU should be nZEB according to the EPBD. The required decrease in energy consumption of low energy buildings will range from 30-50 % of what is presently required for new buildings with existing regulations. Figure 8 illustrates the primary energy consumption per m2 for new nZEB buildings. There is not a single, harmonised definition of nZEB across Europe: different nZEB approaches and criteria are used in EU countries, which doesnt allow a fair comparison across countries. For most countries, new nZEB buildings are expected to consume less than 50 kWhm2 per year (including general energy use for water heating, air conditioning, ventilation and lighting). For some other countries, primary energy consumption is higher: this is the case for Latvia, Cyprus, Romania and Austria.    Energy efficiency improvements in the services sector    Space heating accounted for approximately 45 % of energy consumption in the services sector in 2014, even if this share is down from (54 % in 2005. Water heating and cooking remain rather stable accounting for 5 % each of energy consumption in the services sector in 2014. Air conditioning only accounted for 5 % of energy consumption in the services sector in 2014, compared with 3 % in 1990. Energy consumption per employee (normal climate) decreased by 0.3 % per year since 1990 at the EU level, although the rate increased to 0.7 % per year between 2005 and 2014. For electricity, the consumption per employee increased by 1.7 % year in almost all EU countries between 1990 and 2005. After 2005, this growth has been rather low at 0.1 % per year. Most countries use between 5 000 and 7 000 kWh per employee (4 947 kWh per employee at the EU level). France, Sweden, Luxembourg, Finland and Norway use by far the largest amount of electricity per employee (around 30 % for France and Sweden up to 50 % for Luxembourg and Finland).     [1] Specific consumption per m is more relevant to assess energy efficiency from a technical point of view than specific consumption per dwelling, as the effect of a change in the size of dwellings is removed. If reducing the size of dwellings was considered as a measure to improve energy efficiency in the household sector, the indicator per dwelling would be more apt. However, there is no real example of energy efficiency policies trying to limit the sizes of dwellings.   [2] At normal climate.   [3] According to ODYSSEEE-definitions, the floor area corresponds to the average dwelling size. However, in some countries there is a considerable amount of heated common areas in multi-family buildings. When this consumption is included in the heating consumption of the household sector, it overestimates the indicator (e.g. by 17 % in Finland).   [4] Source: GFK from topten.eu, Room air conditioners: recommendations for policy design   [5] The new Energy Label for air conditioners with classes up to A+++ was introduced in January 2013 (Regulation No 626/2011). New models of air conditioner are very efficient with benchmark values as follows: SEER = 10.1, SCOP=5.9. The first label was introduced in 2002 (Directive 2002/31/EC).   [6] Source: GFK from topten.eu  ,Energy efficiency improvements for final consumers   Between 2005 and 2014, energy efficiency for final consumers improved by 28 %, at an annual average rate of 1.4 % per year, as measured according to the ODEX indicator[1] see (Figure 1). All sectors contributed to this improvement, with the largest gains registered in the industry and households sectors. Between 2005 and 2014, energy efficiency also improved at a rate of 1.4 % per year. The energy efficiency progress stagnated after the economic crisis between 2007 and 2009: annual average improvement rates were 0.6 % per year between 2007 and 2010, compared with 1.2 % per year between 2000 and 2008. Energy efficiency in industry increased by 36 % in the EU-28 between 1990 and 2014, at an annual average rate of 1.8 % per year. Greater progress was achieved in the 1990s, with improvement rates of 2.5 % per year between 1990 and 2000. After 2005, there was a net slowdown in energy efficiency improvement in industry,[2] which fell to 1.3 % per year, compared with 2.2 % per year between 1990 and 2005. Improvements in energy efficiency were observed in all branches of industry, most notably in energy intensive branches. The four most energy intensive branchesare chemicals, steel, cement and paper. Together, these four branches represented around 54 % of industrial energy consumption in 2014. Since 1990, they reduced their specific energy consumption (i.e. their energy consumption per unit of physical output) as follows: steel (-3.2 % per year), cement (-1.5 % per year), cement (-1.3 % per year) and paper (-0.9 % per year). Energy efficiency in the household sector increased by 33 % between 1990 and 2014, at an average rate of 1.7 % per year. Most of the progress in this sector was due to energy efficiency improvements in space heating (renovation of buildings, more efficient new buildings and heating appliances registered an improvement of 1.9 % per year), and the diffusion of more efficient large electrical appliances (+ 1.7 % per year). Since 2005, energy efficiency has improved by 2.5 % year, compared with an improvement rate of 1.2 % per year between 1990 and 2005). This was mainly because of the implementation of new legislation (the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive in 2010 and the Energy Efficiency Directive in 2012) and different national initiatives. In the transport sector, energy efficiency increased by 20 % between 1990 and 2014 in the EU as a whole, at an average annual rate of 0.9 % (the figure was 1.1 % per year from 2005 to 2014 and 0.9 % per year from 1990 to 2005). Most of this progress was because of the increased efficiency of aeroplanes and road transport, which improved by 2.2 % per year and 1.3 % per year, respectively). The energy efficiency of cars, which is measured by calculating the reduction in the average specific fuel consumption of cars in litres per 100 km, improved by 1 % per year after 1990. This was mainly becasue of the diffusion of more efficient new cars, driven by the combined effect of higher fuel prices, substitution of gasoline with diesel and various EU and national measures applied to new cars. In 2015, average emission levels were below 120 g CO2/km[3], which is 8 % below the official target set for 2015[4]. The most efficient new cars in 2015 were bought in the Netherlands (101 g CO2/km), followed by Portugal and Denmark, where new cars emitted on average 106 g CO2/km. The least efficient cars were bought in Estonia and Latvia (on average 137 g CO2/km) and Bulgaria (130 g CO2/km). For trucks and light vehicles, and rail transport, few improvements have been registered since 1990. Trucks and light vehicles registered improvement rates of 0.5 % per year and rail transport, 0.8 % per year. In the service sector, energy efficiency improved by 21 % between 1990 and 2014, at an average annual rate of 1 % per year. The low gains in this sector were mainly a result of the increasing electricity consumption per employee pre-2005 (1.7 % per year), compared with a figure of 0.1 % per year between 2005 and 2014. The increasing trend observed in almost all EU countries can be ascribed to the increased use of air conditioning in southern European countries, the use of information and communications technology and other office equipment in general. During recent years (2013-2014), this trend has slowed or reversed in some countries, because of the diffusion of more efficient equipment. Meanwhile, if only fossil fuel is considered, a slight decrease of the energy consumption per employee (-1.5 % per year on average and -2.1 % per year since 2005) can be observed [5].     [1] The ODEX represents a better proxy for assessing energy efficiency trends by sector (industry, transport, households and tertiary) and for the whole economy (all final consumers).   [2] During the economic crisis, factories and industrial equipment did not operate at full capacity.

"assessment-7  Real change in transport prices by mode     In comparison to average consumer prices, the cost of purchasing motor cars has decreased significantly since 1996, taking 2015 as the reference point.   In contrast, the cost of passenger services and the operation of personal transport equipment has generally increased.   The vitality of the transport market can be seen in 2009, for example, when overall transport prices fell at a faster rate than average consumer prices, primarily due to a significant drop in the average crude oil price between 2008 and 2009, and subsequent reductions in fuel prices.   Rail transport prices are less closely tied to the costs of fuel as most services operate under public service obligations and an increasing proportion of passenger rail is electric-powered.   Overall transport prices appear to peak in 2012, largely driven by a peak in the price for the operation of personal transport equipment.     transport prices TERM TERM020 020,Passenger transport in Europe is forecast to grow by more than 50 % by 2050 (from a 2013 baseline), and freight transport by 80 % (EC MEMO/13/897). With this significant growth, it is important that prices are monitored to see if users are given appropriate incentives to use more environmentally-friendly modes of transport. Changes in transport prices drive individual and business transport decisions; fair and efficient price signals are required. To encourage this, one of the visions of the 2011 Transport White Paper, which seeks to further promote the attractiveness of certain non-road transport modes, is to confront all modes with their full costs (including the costs of negative externalities). The cost of transport reflects changes in areas such as vehicle technology developments and international energy prices, as well as state interventions through regulation, subsidies and taxation (see TERM021). Government actions can internalise the environmental externalities of different transport modes through economic incentives. The tax systems of many countries already internalise some external costs either overtly or as an implicit by-product of revenue raising through transport-specific taxes. This can lead to users shifting between modes. The economic incentives for modal shifts can be monitored through the indicator of transport prices by mode indicator. Prices are relatively easy to measure and compare over time, as long as the product or service in question stays the same. However, there are variations that take place over time that can affect the reliability of the comparison. For example, people tend not to purchase the same cars as ten years ago, and dont use the same package of transport services (price/quality) as previously. Therefore, only limited conclusions about trends in transport prices can be drawn. Most care should be taken when interpreting the prices of car purchases and air travel. The price and quality characteristics of these products have changed the most during the recent years. For example, in air transport, an increasing share of travelers are choosing low-cost carriers that offer less service for lower prices. On average, over the last five years, transport price indices for the EU-28 Member States show that real (inflation adjusted) passenger transport prices have increased, apart for purchasing cars and the operation of personal transport equipment. Vehicle purchase prices have steadily fallen over time in relation to average consumer prices, making it easier for people to afford a car. Together with a probable rise in incomes, this may have been an important driving force between the increased vehicle ownership in the EU (see TERM032). Increased vehicle ownership is the primary driver behind increased choice of cars as a transport mode. This often leads to increased transport demand and subsequent environmental pressures as the costs of vehicle use are relatively low and many cost items are fixed (e.g. depreciation, insurance and holders tax). Similar trends are seen in the newer Member States as greater affordability of car purchases is even more pronounced. In the past, a rise in air-travel price indices has not been regarded as representative due to the growing market share of low-cost airlines and greater competition. Prices have more clearly decreased for certain origins and destinations, generally those associated with leisure trips and off-peak trips. In contrast, the real cost of rail travel has risen steadily since 2000 and at an ever increasing rate. Since an increasing proportion of passenger rail (especially high-speed) is electric-powered, prices are less closely tied to the price of crude oil.,Little information is available regarding freight transport prices. In general, since 1998prices for freight transport on commercial ferries and by road increased slightly. In addition, prices for freight transported by sea, however, are variable, but have, in general, declined. The cost decreases for water transport are largely a result of economies of scale (larger ships, lower average shipping weight and longer distances). There is wide variation in the levels of taxation and road-user charges across Member States, creating a distorted road-freight market. Operating costs are significantly lower in some countries than others, which is one of the reasons for the large proportion of sub-contracting; companies will out-source non-profitable jobs to smaller companies, especially in Eastern Europe (EC, 2014a). This level of fragmentation can mean that small operators arent able to fully recover costs such as fuel price increases; often companies struggle to pass on the cost to the consumer, which may be keeping freight prices artificially low. It is estimated that transport has a relatively low share (maximum 10 %) in the price of the final products (Christidis and Brons, 2010). This has an impact on the distance a product travels from where it is grown or produced to where it is consumed. Establishing a fair but competitive market across Europe requires further harmonisation between Member States (EC, 2014b)."
"assessment-6  Transport fuel prices and taxes      Since 1980, the real price of transport fuel, including taxes,has fluctuated between EUR 0.75 and EUR 1.25 per litre, with an average price of EUR 0.98 per litre.This price covers   all transport fuels and is expressed as the equivalent consumption of unleaded petrol. It is corrected for inflation to 2005 prices and includes taxes.      At just EUR 0.98  , t  he average European fuel price in June 2016 was slightly lower than the long-term average   .      Both freight and transport demand have increased significantly over the past years.     The extent to which fuel taxes have been used to internalise environmental externalities has not significantly changed during the period in question. T  axes on transport fuels have not been widely used in Europe as an  environmental  policy measure that can directlyinfluence transport demand levels. Such a tax  which would reduce the environmental harm causedby the sector  .      fuel prices TERM TERM021 021,Since 1980, the real price of transport fuel (i.e. all transport fuels, expressed as the equivalent consumption of unleaded petrol and corrected for inflation to 2005 prices),including taxes,has fluctuated between EUR 0.75 and 1.25 per litre, with an average price of EUR 0.98. Real prices per litre peaked at EUR 1.24 in July 2008, then fell by around a third later that year, largely due to a significant drop in the price of crude oil. Another peak occurred in August 2012 when fuel prices reached EUR 1.25 per litre. Since then fuel prices have fallen to EUR 0.84 per litre in February 2016. The first months of 2016 show an increasing trend. The average real price in June 2016 was EUR 0.98. The price of fuel is an important determinant of the demand for transport and the efficiency with which fuel is used. However, despite rising real fuel prices over the last two decades, transport demand has also increased. If taxes are excluded, prices follow a similar trend over the same period. They have fluctuated between EUR 0.18 and 0.65 per litre, with an average price of EUR 0.38. Real prices per litre peaked in June 2008, then fell by around a third later that year, largely due to a significant drop in the price of crude oil. Another peak occurred in September 2012, when fuel prices reached EUR 0.63 per litre. Since then fuel prices have fallen to EUR 0.27 in February 2016, slightly below the average price of EUR 0.38. The first months of 2016 show an increasing trend. The average real price in June 2016 was EUR 0.36 per litre. Nominal prices of all transport fuels have, however, risen considerably and the average price is more than two times higher than at the start of the data series in 1980. The real average price of road fuel in the EU (inflation corrected using the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), reference year 2005) has increased less. In real terms, fuel is now approximately 6 % cheaper than in 1980 but 16 % more expensive than in 1990. In recent years fuel prices have also become more volatile. Taxes, as a percentage of fuel prices, have generally declined along with the increase in crude oil prices in recent years. In absolute terms, there was an upward trend in tax revenues per 1 000 litres (i.e. excise duties and VAT) in the 1990s, and jumps in 1991 and 1994 reflect significant German fuel tax increases that were used to fund reunification. Fuel taxes peaked around 2001 and have since shown a fairly constant long-term trend, except in 2009 when they reached a minimum. Apart from the United Kingdom, where the same tax per litre applies for diesel and petrol, all other Member States tax diesel less than petrol.Therefore, in June 2015, despite being more expensive than petrol before tax, diesel was cheaper at the pump than petrol in all EU Member States. This has contributed to a shift from petrol to diesel vehicles in recent decades. This taxation strategy is implemented despite evidence to suggest that the external costs of diesel vehicles are, on average, higher than those of petrol vehicles (see TERM025). Although they are more fuel efficient, diesels emit higher levels of the air pollutants nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter than petrol vehicles.In 1980, petrol accounted for about two thirds and diesel for one third of fuel sales. More recently, the situation has reversed, with diesel accounting for 75% of fuel consumption by weight since 2013. This trend can be explained both by a growth in road freight transport (relative to transport by passenger car) and a higher proportion of diesel passenger cars in the European fleet. Fuel prices can be used to assess and explain developments in transport demand, as they are closely linked through price elasticities of demand. Changes in the price of fuels can lead to a change in the demand for transport and also have a significant impact in the longer term on the efficiency of vehicles purchased. Despite the fact that real fuel prices have shown a fluctuating but upward trend over the last two decades, this has not been sufficient to deter overall growth in road transport demand. Methods to incorporate price internalisation have not significantly changed, with recent fuel price increases attributed to the rise in the price of base oil. The price per litre of Euro-Super 95 has, for example, decreased by 40 %, excluding taxes, over the past four years (since April 2012, EU weighted average) and decreased by 22 %, including taxes (excise duty and other indirect taxes plus VAT) (DG ENER, 2014). In June 2016, in the EU-15, taxes and duties accounted for a weighted averageof 65 % offuel prices for unleaded petrol, and 60 % for diesel. In the EU-13, the they accounted for 58 % and 55 %, respectively. Road fuel excise duties in the EU-28 are shown in Figure 3 (data from June 2016). Apart from the UK, which applies the same tax per litre for diesel and petrol, all other Member States tax diesel less than petrol. The largest differences are found in Greece (where tax on diesel tax is approximately 50 % less than on petrol) and in the Netherlands, Portugal, Denmark and the Slovak Republic (where diesel taxes are more than 30 % lower)."
"annex-2-progress-towards-renewable  Annex 2 Progress towards renewable energy targets: data and methodology  This annex provides technical details on the data and methods used by the EEA to track current and projected progress towards renewable energy targets in the EU.  emissions trends and projections   1 Reporting requirements related to renewable energy   Under the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), Member States need to report on their progress towards the deployment of energy from renewable sources (EU, 2009). Reporting under the RED takes place biennially in a standardised format. Furthermore, under the Energy Statistics Regulation, Member States also report data on their renewable energy deployment to Eurostat.   2 Data sources related to renewable energy deployment   The analysis presented in this report is based on several sources relating to renewable energy use in Europe.   Historic trends for the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption   The assessment of progress towards objectives and targets for the use of energy from renewable sources (RES) is, for the most part, based on information reported by Member States to Eurostat under the Energy Statistics Regulation and the RED, and published by Eurostat via its SHARES tool (Eurostat, 2016).   Share of RES in gross final energy consumption in 2014   The shares of RES in gross final energy consumption in 2014 were estimated by Eurostat, based on national data transmission under Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008 on energy statistics (EU, 2008). In accordance with the accounting rules in the RED, electricity generated by hydro and wind power were normalised to account for annual variations (hydro over 15 years and wind over five years). For details on the normalisation rules, see the SHARES manual provided by Eurostat (Eurostat, 2016). Because of their insular and peripheral geography, Cyprus and Maltas gross inland consumption is disproportionally high for aviation, and they are thus strongly affected by current technological and regulatory constraints. Therefore, they have exemptions with regard to the amounts by which they exceed the EUs average gross final consumption of energy in aviation in 2005 as assessed by Eurostat, i.e. 4.12%.   Approximated shares of renewable energy use in 2015   The approximated shares of renewable energy use in 2015 were estimated by the EEA and will be published in early 2017 (EEA, forthcoming).   The 2020 RES targets and indicative trajectories for the period from 2011 to 2018   The 2020 RES targets for each Member State were taken from Part A of Annex I of the RED, and the indicative trajectories for the 20112018 period were taken from Part B of Annex I of the RED (EU, 2009).   Anticipated national RES trajectories for the period from 2010 to 2020   Anticipated national RES trajectories for the 20102020 period were derived from information submitted by Member States to the European Commission in 2010, in the context of their national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs). These trajectories reflect how Member States themselves anticipate their renewable energy deployment to develop up to 2020 (EEA, 2011; EC, 2013).   The shares of energy from renewable sources on a sectoral level   The report also presents data on RES use on a sectoral level (for electricity, heating and cooling, and transport). These data are based on Eurostats SHARES tool (Eurostat, 2016). Approximate 2015 values were estimated by the EEA (EEA, forthcoming).   3 Tracking progress towards renewable energy targets   The progress of Member States towards their targets under the RED is assessed by comparing the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption with two sets of indicative targets for the period until 2020:     indicative targets set under the RED, which are always defined for a period of two years (e.g. for 2013/2014 and 2015/2016);   anticipated renewable energy deployment as reported in NREAPs via the anticipated NREAP trajectories on a yearly basis.     Assessments of progress take place using the following methodology:     A Member State is considered on track (green)if:    its average 2013/2014 share of energy from renewable sources matched or exceeded its indicative 2013/2014 RED target;   its 2014 share of energy from renewable sources reached or exceeded its anticipated NREAP trajectory.       A Member State is considered not on track (yellow) if it did not reach its anticipated NREAP trajectory in 2014.   A Member State is considered not on track (orange) if its average 2013/2014 share of energy from renewable sources was below its 2013/2014 indicative RED target.

Assessments of progress take place using the following methodology:  A Member State is considered on track (green)if:  its average 2013/2014 share of energy from renewable sources matched or exceeded its indicative 2013/2014 RED target; its 2014 share of energy from renewable sources reached or exceeded its anticipated NREAP trajectory.   A Member State is considered not on track (yellow) if it did not reach its anticipated NREAP trajectory in 2014. A Member State is considered not on track (orange) if its average 2013/2014 share of energy from renewable sources was below its 2013/2014 indicative RED target.

"assessment-1  Alternative-fuel vehicles as a proportion of the total fleet     Compared with 2014, sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in the EU-28 increased by 49 % in 2015, continuing a steep upward trend since 2008. Nevertheless, electric vehicles (EVs) continue to  constitute only a very small fraction of new vehicle registrations  .    According to the most recent estimates, the number of alternative fuel passenger cars as a proportion of the total fleet has remained constant around 5 % over the last five years, with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cars making up the largest proportion.  The number of  electric vehicles (EVs) has grown, although it represents a minor proportion (0.11 %) of total passenger car fleet numbers.      passenger cars alternative fuels term 034   TERM TERM034 034,LPG cars dominate the alternative-fuel passenger car fleet. The number of LPG passenger cars almost doubled between 2005 and 2015, reaching 10 million vehicles in 2015. Poland and Italy are the leading countries in the EU-28 with 2.6 million and 2.4 million cars respectively. LPG vehicles account for about 4.3 % of the overall passenger car fleet in the EEA-33. This figure has remained rather constant over the last five years. Registrations of new LPG passenger cars peaked in 2009 at 3.6 % of new registrations, while alternative fuelled car registrations accounted for 3.75 % of of total registrations in the same year. After a sharp decrease following theeconomicrecession, registrations of new LPG vehicles have remained broadly constant. By way of contrast, sales of electric and hybridvehicleshave increased rapidly in recent years and together outsold LPG vehicles by more than a third in 2015. The number of natural gas (NG) passenger cars almost tripled between 2005 and 2015. However, they still represent just 1.3 % of the total passenger car fleet. The number of NG passenger cars is only significant in Italy and the United Kingdom (about one million), with only small numbers (a few thousand) to be found in other EU Member States. The registration of new NG cars shows an increasing trend over the same period, although as a proportion of total new registrations (0.5 %) their number remains low. The pollutant emissions of properly adjusted LPG and NG vehicles should differ little from petrol vehicles. This is because all three fuels generally contain the same families of chemicals (paraffinic hydrocarbons  petrol also contains aromatics) and because the spark ignition combustion process is similar for both fuels. Only methane (CH4) emissions from NG vehicles are substantially higher than petrol, as the fuel as such is 90 % methane, which is relatively difficult to ignite in cold areas within the combustion chamber. LPG has approximately 80 % of the energy content of petrol per litre, while the volumetric energy content of NG ranges from 5 times less than that of petrol for compressed natural gas to 1.8 times less for liquefied natural gas. Despite the energy content disadvantage, both alternative fuels are considered to be promising fuels for the future, mainly because of their widespread availability and alternative energy pathway to oil, as well as the low CO2 yield per unit of energy delivered. Hybrid vehicles are not always distinguished from conventional petrol and diesel vehicles in official statistics and hence only some estimates of their numbers can be made. While in 2001, only two hybrid vehicle models were available in the EU, and only about 2000 were sold, more than 30 hybrid models are now on sale and around 130 000 were sold in 2015. However, hybrid vehicles make up only 0.9 % of new vehicle sales in the EU. Electric cars are slowly penetrating the EU market. These include battery electric vehicles (BEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and electric vehicles with a range extender (REEV). Despite their small numbers (about 268 000) and their small market share (about 0.11 % of the total passenger car fleet), the number of electric car new registrations in the EU has been increasing steadily over the last years. Sales of BEVs increased by 49 % in 2015 compared with 2014, which continues an increasing trend from 2008. France tops the rankings with 17 660 BEVs sold in 2015, followed by Germany with 12 375, a considerable increase compared with 2014 in both countries. Outside the EU, around 22.5 % of all new cars sold in Norway during 2015 were electric (including PHEVs and BEVs). Among EEA member countries, this makes Norway a leading market for electric vehicles in terms of market share. In addition to BEVs an increasing number of PHEV and REEV vehicles (112 365 petrol and 14 580 diesel) are registered in the EU-28. However, collectively, electric vehicles account for just 0.4 % of total new registrations in the EU-28. Most countries in Europe offer financial incentives such as tax reductions and exemptions for electrically chargeable vehicles. Such incentives can include, for example, exemptions from one-off purchase tax (making the cost comparable with conventional vehicles), VAT exemption, use of bus lanes etc. Compared with passenger cars, the percentage of alternative-fuel light commercial vehicles and buses is low, with numbers around 1.7 % of the total LCV fleet and 2 % of the bus fleet respectively. NG buses show an increasing trend over the years, however they only accounted for about 1 % of the total bus fleet in 2015. The numbers of LPG and electric (mainly trolleys) buses are much lower and have remained rather constant over the last 4-5 years. France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Turkey are the only countries with significant numbers (i.e. above 600) of NG buses. Numbers of LPG light commercial vehicles (LCVs) continue to increase, but they only account for about 1.2 % of the total LCV fleet, whereas the number of NG LCVs is much smaller at about 0.5 %. Poland is the only country with a significant number of LPG LCVs (around 200 000) and Italy has the highest number of NG LCVs (about 99 000). At slightly above 1.4 % over the last three years (20132015), the registration of new alternative-fuel LCVs remains low."
"use-of-cleaner-and-alternative-10  Use of renewable fuels in transport      The proportion of renewable energy used by the transport sector is growing but remains small. Across the EU-28, the average share of renewable energy used in transport was 5.4 % in 2013, a 0.4 % increase compared to the previous year. EEA data indicate that   the share of     renewable energy supply in the transport sector  (RES-T) further increased to 5.9 % in 2014. These figures include only those biofuels that meet the sustainability criteria of the European Unions (EU) Renewable Energy Directive (RED). All EU Member States are required to achieve a 10 % share in renewable energy by 2020, for all transport options. The   progress   of individual Member States towards this target varies, with most requiring significant further increases.     Initially, the EU supported biofuels as a way to help mitigate climate change, but time and research has shown that making fuels out of crops has led to deforestation and increased stress on land resources, as well as potentially inflating food prices. As such, a 7%   cap   on the amount of biofuels made from crops has been proposed. Next generation biofuels made from waste or algae may not raise the same problems but will require large investments toachievelarge scale production.     In 2011, EUROSTAT published the first data on the share of biofuels in transport energy use that meet the sustainability criteria of the Renewable Energy Directive (Art. 17 & Art. 18, 2009/28/EC). In 2011, 3.4% of the energy consumed in transport was renewable, most of it from biofuels that meet the sustainability criteria. Most Member States require significant further increases in order to reach the Directives target of a 10% share of renewable energy in transport by 2020.      renewable energy term 031 transport   CSI CSI037 TERM TERM031 037 031, All Member States have national targets detailing how they propose to comply with the overall target of a 10% share of renewable energy supply in the transport sector (RES-T) by 2020, when only biofuels complying with the sustainability criteria under the RED are to be counted towards this target. The most recent data show that in 2014, 5.9% of the energy consumed in transport is renewable, when including only those biofuels which met the sustainability criteria.  In 2014, Finland was the EU country that used the largest amount of renewable energy in transport with a RES-T of 21.6 %, an increase of more than half compared to thepreviousyear. Moreover, Swedens RES-T in 2014 corresponded to 19.2 %. Both Finland and Sweden have already reached the 2020 target of a 10% share of renewable energy in transport as set by the RED. Other EU Member States with high shares of RES-T include Austria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary and Slovakia, all of which have shares above 6%.  In general the proportion of renewable energy used by the transport sector is growing but remains small. Several reasons lie behind the slow uptake of renewable fuels across the EU, including:   Market uncertainty caused by delays in limiting the risk of greenhouse gas emissions due to indirect land use change; Relatively high abatement costs related to biofuels; Slow progress in the deployment of second-generation biofuels.

"assessment-3  Investment in transport infrastructure               Since the mid-1990s, spending on transport infrastructure has increasedsignificantlyacross the EEA-33 member countries, reaching a peak in 2009. It has subsequently decreased each year. Despite these reductions, in 2014, the level ofspending was 8 % higher than in 1995.     The share of road transport investment has decreased from a high of 61 % in 1995 to a 52 % share of total investment in 2014. Rail investments comprised a 37 % share in 2014, a larger fraction than in 1995 when the figure was less than 27 %. Infrastructurespending on other transport modes has remained broadly constant.             TERM TERM019 019,For the EEA-33 Member Countries, absolute annual investment in transport infrastructure rose from around 2005 94 bn in 1995 to over 2005 102 bn in 2014*, an increase of around 8%. Spending reached its highest level in 2009, peaking at almost 40 % higher than the amount spent in 1995, before declining rapidly. The greatest transport infrastructure related expenses are made on road infrastructure, which accounted for 52 % of total spending in 2014, even though this share has decreased from a 61 % share in 1995. Inland waterways continue to receive the lowest levels of investment, constituting approximately less than 2% of total spending in 2014. Spending in this area has decreased by more than 37 % since 1995. However, the share of overall infrastructure investment allocated to railways in the EEA-33 has slightly increased over time. In 1995, it was 27 %, in 2000, 30 % and in 2014, 37 %. In principle, this is consistent with the EUs objective of shifting traffic to more environmentally friendly modes. In the EU, there is a marked difference in investment trends between the EU-13 and EU-15 regions. Overall investment in transport infrastructure in the EU-13 is only 11 % of that in the EU-15. *2005 is the value of the euro at constant 2005 prices.,The proportion of GDP invested in transport infrastructure in the EEA-33 Member States (for which data were available) increased slightly between 1995 and 2009, but declined thereafter. In 2014, infrastructure spending as a proportion of GDP was more than one quarter lower than 2003 levels, the year in which the proportion was highest. Spending as a proportion of GDP decreased by 1 % between 2013 and 2014. Road, sea and air infrastructure all sawa decrease in the proportion of GDP invested in them between 2004 and 2014.The largest decrease in this period was for sea transport infrastructure, which saw a decrease of approximately 50 %. There has been a significant difference in investment trends as a proportion of GDP between the EU-13 and the EU-15. Between 2013 and 2014, the share of investment in rail, inland waterways and air in the EU-13 increased, while in the EU-15, only rail experienced growth in investment."
"assessment  Capacity of infrastructure networks     The total length of motorways in the EEA-33 increased by 19% between 2004 and 2014. Over the same period, data show a 1 % increase in the total length of both inland waterways and pipelines, while the total length of railway track increased by less than 1%.    In the EEA-33, the total length of motorways increased by   77 % between   1990 and 2014. This compared with increases of 16 % for inland waterways  and 19 %  for pipelines. The total length of railways decreased by 9 % over the same time period.     Infrastructure length is only a proxy measure for capacity, but the steady decrease in the length of conventional rail infrastructure between 1990 and today indicates a corresponding reduction in capacity.      The full extent of the increase in road transport capacity on motorways may be understated, as the total length of motorways may have increased even more than shown because additional lanes are not counted (see the Indicator specification). In contrast, the railway figures give total track length, not length by route.     Increasing infrastructure capacity is not always necessary to cope with capacity and congestion problems. Optimisation of the capacity of the existing infrastructure through interconnectivity, interoperability and intermodality still has much potential throughout Europe. In addition, policies to optimise networkusage patterns, such as road pricing, have yet to be fully exploited. The application of these could be environmentally and socially beneficial compared with the construction of new infrastructure.      freight transport rail infrastructure transport   TERM TERM018 018,Infrastructure networks The design, construction and use of road, rail and waterborne transport infrastructure alters the quality and connectivity of habitats to the movement of plants and animals between habitat patches. The development and functioning of the transport infrastructure has been linked in part to the failure of the EU to meet its target to halt biodiversity loss by 2010, and is seen as a barrier to achieving the goals of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020. Between 2004 and 2014, the total length of the motorway network in the EEA-33 that was included in the analysis increased by 19 %. The strongest absolute growth in kilometres is in Spain, which accounts for 32 % of the total additional kilometres built. The combined growth inFrance, Hungary, Poland and Spain account for 55 % of the total additional kilometres built in this period. Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Romania and Norway had the largest percentage increase in motorway length between 2004 and 2014, more than doubling their motorway length. The density of the motorway network is closely related to population density and the degree of urbanisation. The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg had the highest motorway network densities in 2014 at over 59 km/1000 km2, 58 km/1000 km2 and 71 km/1000 km2 respectively. These three countries also have some of the highest population densities of all the countries with motorway infrastructure. As shown in Figure 1, the length of railway lines in the EEA-33 increased by less than 1% between 2004 and 2014. This is mainly because of a 2 % increasein the EU-15 and a 3 % reductionin the EU-13. Approximately 54 % of railway lines are electrified in the EEA-33 countries for which data was provided. The total length of electrified railway tracks in the EU-15 increased by 7% between 2004 and 2014, compared with the increase of less than 1 % in the EU-13. The length of the EUs high speed rail (HSR) network has almost doubled over the past decade. In 2014, the network length was more than 7 300 kilometres  an increase of around 72 % since 2004. Figure 3 shows rail infrastructure utilisation in terms of total freight traffic per kilometre, and passengers carried per kilometre in 2014. Utilisation of rail for passenger transport was higher in the EU-15(1.6 M passenger-km (pkm) per km of railway on average) than in the to the EU-13 (0.4 M pkm per km of railway). Conversely, utilisation ofrailfor freight purposes was higher inthe EU-13 (1.3 Mt-km per km railway on average) than in the EU-15 (1.1 Mt-km per km railway). In the EEA-33,data on inland waterways show an increase in network length of 1% between 2004 and 2014. There may, however, be data quality issues as in several Member States there are considerable jumps in the data, which suggest that different counting methodologies may have been used in different years for a single country (for this reason data from Latvia have been excluded). Oil pipeline infrastructure in the EEA-33 increased by 1% between 2004 and 2014 (data for Norway and Greece have been excluded from the analysis due to a methodological change to the data during the time series).In Eastern Europein particular,pipeline infrastructure increased over the same period. Examples include the trans-European gas pipeline infrastructure across 38 European countries (EEA-32 plus Belarus,Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey,Ukraine and West Russia), which exceeds 436 000 kilometres (Carvalho et. al, 2009).   Infrastructure density   Infrastructure density, measured as the length of infrastructure per unit land area, is a proxy indicator for a countrys transport capacity (see Table 1), but is to some extent correlated with geographical characteristics. Densely populated small countries (Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) have high infrastructure densities, while the Scandinavian countries and most new Member States have relatively low infrastructure densities. The density of infrastructure is also a proxy-indicator for accessibility, since it provides a measure of travel distances to transport networks. Network extension In October 2013, the European Commission published maps that show the nine major corridors that will act as a backbone for transportation in Europe (EC, 2013). To match the level of ambition, EU financing for transport infrastructure will be tripled to EUR 26 billion for the 2014 to 2020 period. The new infrastructure policy, which was finalised in January 2014, will transform the existing patchwork of European roads, railways, airports and canals into a unified trans-European transport network (TEN-T). The new policy establishes, for the first time, a core transport network built on nine major corridors: two north-south corridors, three east-west corridors and four diagonal corridors. It will transform east-west connections, remove bottlenecks, upgrade infrastructure and streamline cross-border transport operations for passengers and businesses throughout the EU. The work plans for the core network corridors were put in place in June 2015 (EC, 2015) and established the basis for action up to 2030. The new core network will:  connect 94 major European ports with rail and road links, connect 38 key airports with rail connections into major cities, upgrade 15 000 km of railway track to high speed, set up 35 cross-border projects to reduce bottlenecks.

"assessment-6  Freight transport demand      Freight transport grew considerably in the EU28 between 2000 and 2008. A sharp fall in freight demand occurred  in the years immediately following the economic crisis and, following a limited recovery, freight volumes have sinceremained largely stable.     In 2014, total freight transport in the EU-28 was 8.6 % higher than in 2000, but 8 % below its 2007 peak .  It  remained broadly stable in 2013 and increased by 1.4 % in 2014, mainly due to an increase in maritime freight.     Maritime freight transport increased by 3.8 % between 2013 and 2014, whereas inland waterway transport decreased by 1.8 %. Rail transport increased by 1.1%, while road and air transport remainedbroadlystable compared with the previous year.     The modal share  freight transported over land remains largely constant, being  dominated by   road transport (75 %), followed by rail (18 %) and inland waterways (7 %).      freight transport CSI CSI036 TERM TERM013 036 013,The majority share of freight in the EU-28 is transported by road. Over timethere has been no substantial change in this share at an aggregatedEU level. By way of contrast, within the EU-13, the share of rail in the total amount of freight transported by road and rail has decreased from more than 40 % in 2000 to almost 22 % in 2014. Conversely, the share of freighttransportedby road has increased. Despite the decrease in rail transport of freight, the share of rail in the EU-13 remains higher than that in the EU-15, with the latter accounting for less than 17 %. Compared with 2000, theshare of rail in the EU-15 has increased slightly.,Alongside economic growth and expansion, total land freight transport within the EU-28 (road, rail and inland waterways) increased steadily throughout the 1990s and early 2000s,growing by 23 % in the years up to 2007. Between 2000 and 2007, the real average annual growth rate of GDP was 2.3 % in the EU28, withhigher growth in the EU13 than in the EU15. This growth tookplace in the context of continued globalisation, withrising trade volumes both within the EU and with tradepartners outside of the EU. A sharp fallin freight demand occurred in the years immediatelyfollowing the economic recession, and since then freightvolumes have recovered slightly but have not yetreached pre-recession levels.In 2014, total land freight transport increased by 1.5 %, in comparison with 2013.  Road: Total road freight volumes in 2014 were around 14 % higher than in 2000. In the EU-15, road freight transportation fell slightly in 2014 compared with 2013, with differentamountsdepending on the country. In the EU-13, volumes grew by 2 %.Road haulage accounted for three quarters of total inland freight movements within the EU-28 in 2014.   Rail: The amount of freight transported by rail has stabilisedoverall. In the EU-28, rail freight volumes were higher in 2014 compared with 2000 (after having reached a peak increase of 11.5 % in 2007, compared to 2000). In 2014, rail freight transport demand increased slightly compared with the previousyear. Changes in rail, both in the EU-13 and EU-15, were minor. Rail freight volumes increased in all the non-EU EEA member countries:by almost 8 % in Turkey, 4.6 % in Norway and 4.2 %in Switzerland.   Inlandwaterways: In 2014, more than 150 billion tonne-kilometres of goods were transported by inland waterways in the EU-28, a slight decrease of around 1.3 % compared with 2013. Throughout the years, a slow but steady increase can be observed in the volumes transported by inland waterways. Compared with 2000, total tonne-kilometersin the EU-28 have increased by 12.7 %. In addition, the EU-28 average masks important national differences. In the EU-15, tonne-kilometershave increased moderately compared with 2000, while they have almost tripled in the EU-13.  If the evolution of the intensity of freight transport inthe EU28 economy (tonne kilometres per unit of GDP in constant 2010 prices) is considered with 2000 as abenchmark, freight intensity was lower from2001 to 2003, but subsequently increased from 2004to 2008. Since 2009, the intensity of freight transport inthe economy has been around 5 % lower than in 2000, while in 2014 it was at the same level as in 2000.This lower intensity coincides with the period of loweror negative economic growth in Europe following theeconomic recession."
"assessment-6  Passenger transport demand      Passenger transport demand in the EU-28 increased by 1.8 % between 2013 and 2014, after an overall downward trend since its peak in 2009. Car passenger travel remains the dominant transport mode accounting for wellover 70 % of total transport. Air transport demand grew by 4 % in 2014 and has a modal share of 9 % (the same as before the economic recession). Rail passenger travel is stable, accounting for 6.5 % of transport demand in 2014.     Land-  based  passenger transport demand also grew in the other EEA member countries. Growth in 2014comparedwith thepreviousyear was 5.1 % in Iceland ,  3.2 % in Norway,   3.1 % in Turkeyand1.8 % in   Switzerland  .      passengers soer2010 thematic assessments consumption transport demand passenger transport transport       CSI CSI035 TERM TERM012 035 012,Passenger transport demand in the EU-28, measured in passenger-kilometres (pkm), experienced a sustained period of robust growth until 2005 for all modes. Since its peak in 2009 (9 % higher than in 2000), it has remained broadly stable, with only a slight overall reduction being seen as a result of the economic recession from 2008 onwards. In 2014, total passenger demand was 10.5 % higher than in 2000, exceeding the 2009 peak by 1.5 %. Since 2000, passenger transport volumes (in pkm) across the different modes have changed as follows:  Passenger cars: +9 %; Powered two-wheelers: +18 %; Buses and coaches: 4 %; Railways: +15 %; Trams and metro: +26 %; Aviation: +32 %; Sea: 10 %.  In absolute terms, passenger cars account for most of the overall increase in passenger transport volumes since 2000, followed by aviation and railways. Since 2000, the EU population has grown by 4 %, less than the 10.5 % growth in passenger transport. Car mobility peaked in the EU-15 in 2009, when most EU-15 Member States reached 'peak car' travel values.  In most EU-13 Member States, per capita car travel keeps growing.The same is truein some non-EU countries such as Turkey, which experienced high growth of around 47 % between 2009 and 2014. Rail passenger traffic volumes since 2008 have dropped significantly in many countries owing to the economic crisis, historic decline, or both. Traffic loss has been particularly high in many eastern European Member States, as well as in certain western countries such as Italy and Portugal. In contrast, rail demand between 2008 and 2014 has continued togrow in a few EU-15 countries, in some cases by 10% or more. This includes Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom. Trends in passenger demand for high-speed rail are difficult to assess, as traffic growth trends are, not surprisingly, greatly influenced by the opening of new services over the past decades. Nevertheless, it seems that its share of total rail passenger traffic is increasing in certain countries such as Italy, while in others it peaked in 2010 (France and Spain) or earlier (Belgium, Portugal and Sweden).  Air transport, includingflights within the EU-28, has varied substantially since 2000. Although it grew rapidly between 2000 and 2007, air transport traffic was particularly affected by the economic crisis; traffic fell by 6.8 % in 2009. Whereas traditional airlines were particularly badlyaffected by the recession, low-cost airlines have grown every year since 2008. Their growth has helped todrive overall growth in the aviation sector since 2009, with air pkm increasing and reaching their highest level in 2014. Trends in inland passenger transport demand and gross domestic product (GDP) have decreasedin intensity (pkm/EUR)since the mid 1990s, with the exception of 2009. In 2009, the sharp reduction in GDP in the EEA-33 was associated with a slight increase in transport volumes compared with previous years, suggesting that passenger transport demand reacts less (and more slowly) to changes in GDP than freight does.,Restrictions on data availability mean that modal split analysis, including ofair transport, is limited to the EU-28. Modal share trends have remained largely stable in the EU-28 in recent decades. Since 1995, air transport (including flights within the EU) has steadily increased from 6.5 % of total transportin 1995 to 9.2 % in 2014, while land transport modes have decreased. As a proportion of total transport, car transport hasremainedalmost constant, decreasing from only73.3 % in 1995 to 72.3 % in 2014, after peaking at 74 % in 2002, 2003 and 2009. Rail transportretained a similar market share in 2014 compared with 1995 (6.5 %), after a slow but continuous recovery from its low of 5.9 % in 2003 and 2004. The market share for bus and coach transporthas continued to decrease at a very slow rate, from 9.4 % in 1995 to 8 % in 2014. There has been a steady trend in the EU-13 towards convergence with EU-15average modal split values, mainly reflected in the rapid growthof car transport compared with other modes. There is no comprehensive EU-wide data on cycling and other forms of non-motorised passenger transport. Various efforts have been made to improve the rates of non-motorised transport in the EU, and estimates of the varying importance of cycling across EU Member States are available in the report Quality of transport (Special Eurobarometer 422a). On average, 8 % of respondents to the Eurobarometer survey mention cycling as the most important mode of travel on a typical day. This ranges from cycling rates of 1 % or less in Cyprus, Malta and Portugal to 36 % in the Netherlands."
"transport-emissions-of-air-pollutants-4  Emissions of air pollutants from transport       Between 1990 and 2014, the transport sector reducedsignificantly  emissions   of certain air pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) (both around 83 %), nitrogen oxides (   NO  x   )   (39 %), sulphur oxides (   SO  x   ) (42 %) and particulate matter (37 % in the case of    PM  2.5    and 31 % for PM   10   ).      Emission reductions from road transport have been lower thanoriginally anticipated over the last two decades, partly because transport has grown more than expected, and for certain pollutants partlyowing to the larger than expected growth in diesel vehicles producing higher NOx and PM emissions than petrol-fuelledvehicles. Furthermore, it is widely accepted that real-world emissions of NOx, particularly from diesel passenger cars andvans, generally exceed the permitted European emission (Euro) standards which define the acceptable limits for exhaust emissions of new vehicles sold in the EU Member States.    Emissions of all pollutants decreased in 2014 compared with the previous year.   NO  x     emissions decreased by   1 %  ,   SO  x   by 10 %  , and PM 10  and PM 2.5  by 2 % and 3 %   respectively. The latest data show that non-exhaust emissions of  primary PM 10 andPM 2.5 such as from tyre and brake-wear, make up 16 % and 27 % of totaltransport emissions of these pollutants, respectively.     All transport modes have reduced emissions since 1990, except for international aviation and shipping for which CO, NOx, SOx,  PM  2.5     emissions of each pollutant have increased.      air pollutant emissions transport emissions air emissions air pollution    TERM TERM003 003,Progress has been made since 1990 in reducing the emissions of many air pollutants from the transport sector. The relative changes in emissions of pollutants from the transport sector are shown in the above figures. Emissions from all transport types have declined since 1990 despite the general increase in activity within the sector since this time. Between 1990 and 2014, emissions ofNOx from transport declined by 39 %, PM2.5by 37 %, SOxby 42 %, CO by 83 % and NMVOCs by 83.6 % across the EEA-33. The scale of policy actions undertaken in Europe to specifically address transport-related air pollution have increased over recent years,reflectingtheimportantcontribution that transport still makes in relation to poor air quality. Local and regional air quality management plans, including initiatives such as low-emission zones in cities or congestion charges, are now undertaken in many areas of high air pollution from transport. Different European legal mechanisms are used to address air quality, including from traffic related sources, including the setting of limit or target values for ambient concentrations of pollutants; limits on total emissions (e.g. national totals); and regulating emissions from the traffic sector either by setting emissions standards (like EURO 1-6) or by setting requirements for fuel quality. Reductions from the road transport sector contribute to the majority of the overall reductions for each pollutant, as shown in the figures above. In contrast, since 1990, international aviation (except NMVOC) and shipping (PM10) are the only transport sub-sectors where emissions of each pollutant have actually increased, while NH3emissions from road transport have also increased (although theycontributeonly a very smallfractionof total NH3 emissions).For example, NOxemissions from international aviation have more than doubled (+113 %) since 1990, while NOxand NMVOC emissions from international shipping have both increased by around 17 % and 23 %, respectively, and PM2.5by 4.4 %. As emissions of pollutants such as NOxand SOxfrom land-based sources decrease, there is a growing awareness of the increasingly important contribution made to Europe's air quality by the national and international shipping sectors, which now are responsible for 18.3 % and 17.6 % of NOxand SOxemissions, respectively. Transport is responsible for more than half of all NOxemissions and contributes significantly (around 13 % or more) to the total emissions of the other pollutants. Road transport, in particular, continues to make a significant contribution to emissions of all the main air pollutants (with the exception of SOx). While emissions from road transport are mostly exhaust emissions arising from fuel combustion, non-exhaust releases contribute to both NMVOCs (from fuel evaporation) and primary PM (from tyre- and brake-wear, and road abrasion). While emissions of primary PM2.5from road transport have declined by 53 % since 1990, the relative importance of non-exhaust emissions has increased, since the introduction of vehicle particulate abatement technologies has reduced exhaust emissions. In 2014, the non-exhaust emissions of PM2.5constituted 34 % of emissions from the road transport sector, compared to just 12 % in 1990 (for PM10the contribution increased from 21 % in 1990 to 50 % in 2014)."
"transport-emissions-of-greenhouse-gases-6  Greenhouse gas emissions from transport      In 2014, the transport sector contributed 25.5 % of total EU-28 greenhouse gas emissions.

International aviation experienced the largest percentage increase in greenhouse gas emissions over 1990 levels (+97 %), followed by international shipping (+24 %) and road transport (+17 %).     Emissions need to fall by around two thirds by 2050, compared with 1990 levels, in order to meet the long-term 60 % greenhouse gas emission reduction target as set out in the 2011 Transport White Paper.       transport emissions ghg emissions  TERM TERM002 002,Greenhouse gas emissions from the EU-28 transport sector (including aviation) decreased between 2008 and 2013, but, in 2014, they increased by0.7 % in comparison with thepreviousyear. This increase is mainly due to higheremissionsfrom road transport, followedby aviation.In 2014, transport (including aviation and shipping) contributed 25.5 % of total greenhouse gas emissions in the EU-28. This figure drops to 21 % if bunkers are excluded from the overall value. In 2014, road transport was responsible for almost 73 % of total greenhouse gas emissions from transport (including aviation and bunkers). Of these emissions, 44 % were contributed by passenger cars, while 18 % came from heavy-duty vehicles. As a result of a significant rise in passenger-kilometer and tonne-kilometer demand, greenhouse gas emissions frominternational aviationalmost doubledfrom 1990 levels (97 %), followed by international shipping (24 %) and road transportation (17 %). In comparison with 2013, EU greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping decreased by 3.2 % in 2014, almost reaching 2000 levels. However, they will need to further reduce by 28.5 % by 2050 in order to meet the EU reduction target of a 40 % reduction in emissions from 2005 levels. However, emissions from transport (including aviation) were still 20.1 % above 1990 levels in 2014, andpreliminary estimates show that emissions from transport rose slightly in 2015. Emissions will, therefore, need to fall by 67 % by 2050 in order to meet the 60 % greenhouse gas emission reductiontargetof the 2011Transport White Paper."
"assessment-6  Final energy consumption by mode of transport       The annual energy consumption in transport in the EEA-33 grew by 38 % between 1990 and 2007. However, the economic recession caused a subsequent decline in transport demand leading to an 8 % decrease in the related energy demand between 2007 and 2014. Nevertheless, between 1990 and 2014, there was a 27 % net growth in the energy consumption in transport in the EEA-33.     The shipping sector saw the greatest decline in energy consumption during the economic recession; it dropped by 11 % between 2008 and 2009 alone, with a total decrease of 23 % between 2007 and 2014. Total energy use in road, aviation and rail transport fell by 5 % between 2007 and 2014.     Road transport accounts for the largest share of energy consumption, with 74 % of the total EEA-33 demand in 2014. Despite a decrease in energy consumption since the recession, road transport energy consumption in 2014 was still 25 % higher than in 1990. The fraction of diesel used in road transport has continued to increase, amounting to 72 % of total fuel sales in 2014.      energy term001 energy cosumption transport    TERM TERM001 001,Total growth In 2014, energy consumption in transport in the EU-28 was 23 % (Figure 1) and in the EEA-33 it was 27 % (Figure 2)higher than in 1990. In the EU-13, most of this growth occurred in road and maritime transport. In the EU-15, however, the growth occurred mainly in air transport, although the largest absolute increase in energy consumption occurred in road transport.  Split of energy consumption between old and new EU Member States In 2014, transport in the the EEA-33 countriesconsumed approximately 17 652 petajoules (PJ, 1015 joules) of energy. The original EU-15 Member States consumed the vast majority of the energy (82 %), with just 11 % consumed by the EU-13 Member States. The final 7 % was used in the remaining EEA member countries. Overall trends in transport energy consumption   Since 1990, energy consumption in transport has increased by 69 % in the EU-13 (see Figure 2). In 2014, just three Member States consumed less energy in the transport sector compared to 1990: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four Member States more than doubled their energy consumption over the same period: the Czech Republic, Ireland, Luxembourg and Poland. Before 2007, energy consumption in transport in the EU-15 had shown steady growth since 1990. However, following peak consumption in 2007, all except Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Malta, Poland, Romania, and Slovenia experienced a reduction in energy consumption in transport, which continued in 2014. However, total energy consumption in the EU-15 was still 19 % higher in 2014 than it was in 1990. In the EU-15, total transport energy consumption increased by 2 % between 2013 and 2014. Inland water transport decreased the most, by approximately 7 %, while rail and maritime transport decreased by 3 % each, and road and air transport increased by 2 and 1 %, respectively. In the EU-13, energy consumption decreased by 8 and 5 % respectively in rail and maritime transport between 2013 and 2014, and increased in air by 5 %, and in road and inland water transport by 3 % each. Sectoral trends  In the EEA-33, aviation has shown the greatest growth in energy consumption of all modes, increasing by 77 % between 1990 and 2014, as shown in Figure 3. In 2014, it was the mode with the second highest energy consumption after road transport. This growth has mostly come from the EU-15, where air transport fuel consumption increased by 71 % over the period. The strongest period of growth for aviation in the EEA-33 was between 1990 and 2007, when it grew by 84 %. However, between 2007 and 2014, energy consumption in aviation in the EEA-33 fell by 4 %. Air transport is predicted to be the mode which sees highest growth, and to become the second most important passenger mode after road transport by 2050, due, for example, to the increasing number of international trips to emerging economies in Asia. Nonetheless, energy consumption is predicted to grow less than aviation activity as more energy efficient aircraft are introduced and the fleet is renewed. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has set ambitious targets for reductions in fuel consumption and emissions by improving fuel efficiency by 1.5 % per year until 2020 and capping aviation emissions from 2020 (EC, 2013). Since 1990, decreasing share of road gasoline consumption was exchanged with increased use of road diesel - a share of road gasoline in total transport energy consumption decreased significantly from 43 % to 20 % in 2014, whereas a share of road diesel increased from 31 % to 49 % in EU-28 (see Figure 4). Also due to growth in energy consumption in aviation, a share of aviation kerosenein total transport energy increased from 9 % in1990 to 12.7% in 2014 in EU-28. In the EU-13, energy consumption in road transport grew by 86 % between 1990 and 2014. In the EU-15, it grew by 15 % over the same time period. This corresponds with an approximately20 % increase in passenger car demand over the last two decades (see TERM012) and an increase of over 70 % in land freight transport in the EU-13 over the last decade (see TERM013). Energy consumption in maritime transport increased by 56 % across the EEA-33 between 1990 and 2007, before decreasing by 23 % between 2007 and 2014. The countries with the highest maritime transport energy use are Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. The low share of energy consumption in rail transport is partly due to a relatively small modal share, but also because, in most situations, rail transport is less energy-intensive than other modes. In 2013, 53 % of the rail network in the EEA-33 was electrified (see TERM018). Rail and domestic waterways were the only modes that recorded an absolute decrease in energy consumption between 1990 and 2014 in the EEA-33. EEA-33 energy consumption in domestic waterways has remained fairly constant throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. The sector experienced an increase in activity between 2002 and 2006, most notably in the EU-15, with energy consumption in 2006 up 19 % on 1990 levels in the EEA-33. It has since declined and in 2014, consumption was 28 % lower than in 1990 for the EU-15, and 26 % lower for the EEA-33. Policy Policies that (1) reduce the demand for transport encourage a shift towards more environmentally-friendly modes, (2) improve transport management and (3) enhance vehicle energy efficiency are required to meet greenhouse gas reduction targets set by the Kyoto protocol and the EU 2030 climate and energy package. They are also required to meet the 70 % reduction in oil consumption from 2008 until 2050, which is included in the Transport White Paper. The EU 2030 policy framework for climate and energy, agreed in 2014 (EC, 2014b), includes:  An EU domestic emissions reduction target of 40 % below 1990 levels by 2030; An increase in the share of renewable energy to at least 27 % of the EUs energy consumption by 2030; An energy efficiency increase target of at least 27 % by 2030; A reform of the EU Emissions Trading System.  Policies that only focus on the incremental efficiency of vehicles will not be sufficient to deliver a long-term, low-carbon transport sector. Further development must alsooptimisethe performance ofmulti-modallogistics chains, and use transport and infrastructure more efficiently through improved traffic management and information systems, advanced logistic and market measures such as the completion of an integrated European railway market, and the removal of barriers to short sea-shipping, etc. (EC, 2011a)."
"renewables-continue-to-grow-in  Renewables continue to grow in the EU, but Member States need to step up ambition on energy savings  The EU Member States have lowered their energy consumption in recent years, despite a slight increase in 2015. At the same time, they use more and more renewable energy. Overall, the 28 Member States are collectively well on their way to meeting their 2020 targets on renewables, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions. However, continuing current trends will fall short of longer term objectives, according to a new European Environment Agency (EEA) assessment published today.    The day after the European Commission proposed  a package to boost clean energy , the EEA presented a new assessment ofthe progress made by EU Member States in meeting their existing 2020 targets on renewable energy and energy efficiency. This analysis is includedin the report  Trends and Projections in Europe 2016: Tracking progress towards Europe climate and energy targets .The EEA report is supported by  country profiles    on energy and climate, providing detailed data at national level.   Our report Trends and projections in Europe 2016 shows that the EU's 2020 targets on energy and climate are now well within reach. But certain trends are alarming, in particular for transport. In that sector, renewable energy use remains insufficient and greenhouse gas emissions are rising again, said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. The way forward is clear: Member States must step up national ambition and efforts to achieve the 2020 and 2030 EU targets, and to keep the EU on a path to a low-carbon, competitive and circular economy by 2050.   On track for 2020 targets   By 2020, 20% of the EUs gross final energy consumption should come from renewable sources. Preliminary estimates for 2015 show that the share of renewables in the EUs final energy consumption continued to increase, reaching a level of 16.4%. This is up from 16.0% in 2014. Twenty two Member States (all except France, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal) are on track to achieve or exceed the levels of renewable energy set in their national action plans.   The EUs 2020 target on energy efficiency corresponds to a 13% reduction of primary energy consumption compared with the 2005 level. Preliminary estimates show that the EUs energy consumption in 2015 was 11% below 2005, despite a 1% increase between 2014 and 2015. The EU remains on track to achieve its 2020 energy efficiency target. Except for Estonia, Malta and Sweden, all EU Member States are on course to meet their targets on primary energy consumption. However, Member States show an overall lack of ambition with regard to their 2020 energy efficiency targets.   More work needed for 2030 and 2050 goals   To achieve the more ambitious longer-term energy and decarbonisation goals set by the EU for 2050, current efforts will have to be considerably stepped up, according to the EEA report. The EU can achieve its 2030 target on renewables if the current pace across Europe is maintained. However, this will require additional efforts because regulatory changes affect investors confidence in renewables, while market barriers persist. Similarly, achieving the 2030 target on energy efficiency will require effective implementation of energy efficiency measures as well as a rapid change in consumer behaviour.   energy consumption climate and energy package renewable energy emissions trends and projections energy efficiency climate and energy targets,The day after the European Commission proposed a package to boost clean energy, the EEA presented a new assessment ofthe progress made by EU Member States in meeting their existing 2020 targets on renewable energy and energy efficiency.

"annex-3-progress-towards-energy  Annex 3 Progress towards energy efficiency targets: data and methodology  This annex provides technical details on the data and methods used by the EEA to track current and projected progress towards energy efficiency targets in the EU.  emissions trends and projections   1 Reporting requirements for energy efficiency/energy consumption   Under Article 3 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) (EU, 2012), Member States had to set their own indicative national energy efficiency targets. Depending on country preferences, these targets are based on primary or final energy consumption, primary or final energy savings, or energy intensity. Each national target reflects the specific situation of the Member State that adopted it. In some Member States, the targets may still be subject to change in the coming years.   2 Data sources for energy consumption   The analysis presented in this report is based on several sources relating to energy consumption in Europe.   Historic trends of primary and final energy consumption   The assessment of progress towards energy efficiency targets is, for the most part, based on information reported by Member States to Eurostat under the Energy Statistics Regulation, and published by Eurostat via its energy statistics database (Eurostat, 2016a, 2016b and 2016c).   Approximated estimates for primary and final energy consumption in 2015   Early estimates of 2015 primary and final energy consumption were prepared by the European Environment Agency (EEA, 2016a and 2016b).   National targets on primary and final energy consumption   The assessment of progress towards energy efficiency targets is based on the targets set under Article 3 of the EED in 2013, including updates as notified by Member States in their 2014 national energy efficiency action plans (NEEAPs) or in a separate notification to the European Commission in 2015 (EC, 2015). The most recent updates were reported by Denmark and Hungary in 2016 (EC, 2016).   3 Tracking progress towards energy efficiency targets   The analysis of progress made towards achieving energy efficiency targets at national levels involves assessing whether or not the efforts undertaken since 2005 have been sufficient to reduce or limit primary energy consumption at a pace sufficient to meet the 2020 target. This question can be addressed by comparing 2014 (or 2015) levels with a linear trajectory between 2005 and the 2020 national target.   This linear assessment is applied to track energy efficiency progress for the following reasons:     unlike renewable energy sources (RESs) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reliable projections and/or targets for interim years until 2020 on energy consumption are not available at Member State level;   no other indicators/parameters/methodologies with a transparent, well-established and statistically known relationship to primary energy consumption are available.     Therefore, this assessment is based on the comparison between average historic trends and the trends deemed necessary to achieve 2020 targets. To remain consistent with the assessments presented for GHG emissions and RESs, the year 2005 was chosen as a single base year, to allow for the comparable assessment of trends across Member States. This methodology does not take into account the level of ambition of the national target (which varies significantly across the European Union (EU)), nor does it capture the complexity of the national context (economic development, ability to attract financing for energy efficiency projects, etc.). Several Member States defined their 2020 targets in terms of final energy consumption (instead of primary energy consumption): Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia and the United Kingdom. For the purpose of cross-country comparison, the officially reported primary energy consumption target was taken into account in this assessment.   The numeric results of this assessment per Member State are shown in greater detail in Table A3.1 below.

"5-progress-towards-member-states  5. Progress towards Member States' renewable energy targets  This chapter presents the current progress achieved by EU Member States towards their national targets on renewable energy. These targets, set under the Renewable Energy Directive, concern the use energy from renewable sources as a proportion of the total energy consumption.  emissions trends and projections   5.1 Current progress towards renewable energy source targets   In order to achieve the European Unions (EUs) objective of a 20% share of energy from renewable sources in its gross final energy consumption by 2020, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sets national targets for each Member State for 2020 (EU, 2009). These targets range from 10% (Malta) to 49% (Sweden). To monitor progress towards these 2020 targets, the RED sets indicative trajectories for the period from 2011 to 2020. These indicative trajectories are expressed as average shares for two-year periods from 2011 to 2018, in addition to the 2020 target.   For the two-year period from 2013 to 2014, all Member States except one (the Netherlands) exceeded their indicative trajectory set in the RED (see Figure 5.1). According to approximated estimates from the European Environment Agency (EEA), the 2015 renewable energy source (RES) targets set in the indicative RED trajectories will not be met by three Member States (France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) for the two-year period from 2015 to 2016 (see Figure 5.2). It is still possible that these countries will stay on course with their indicative RED trajectories by achieving 2016 RES shares that are sufficient to bring the 20152016 averages above the trajectory values.   When considering current RES shares in relation to 2020 targets, in 2014, nine Member States exceeded their national targets for 2020 set under the RED. These countries were Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Lithuania, Romania and Sweden (see Annex 2). According to preliminary estimates from the EEA, in 2015, Denmark also increased its RES share to a level above its 2020 RES target.   Figure 5.1 National shares of energy from renewable sources in relation to indicative RED trajectories       Note: For Croatia, the share of energy from renewable sources changed considerably because of data revisions which took place in 2016. This revealed significantly higher amounts of biomass consumption which drove the proportion of renewable energy use upwards compared with the 2015 report.   Source: EU, 2009; EC, 2013; EEA, 2011 and forthcoming; Eurostat, 2016.      5.2 Progress towards the objectives of national action plans   Member States also set their own estimated trajectory in national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs), which they reported in 2010. These action plans concern the development of renewable energy at the national level, and include indicative trajectories as well as planned RES shares in the transport (RES-T), heating and cooling (RES-H/C), and electricity (RES-E) sectors.   For most Member States, the anticipated trajectories set out in NREAPs are more ambitious than the indicative trajectories defined in the RED(   [1]   ). For example, the indicative RES target for the 20132014 period set out in the RED for Denmark is 20.9%, while this country planned to achieve a share of 27.3% for energy from renewable sources in 2014 according to its NREAP. By contrast, Greece, Latvia, Romania and the United Kingdom have designed trajectories in their NREAPs which are, for some years, lower than those set out in the RED.   In 2014, 22 Member States reached or exceeded the RES targets outlined in their NREAPs for that year (see Figure 5.2). However, for six Member States (France, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal) in 2014, the RES shares were below the anticipated trajectories laid out in their corresponding NREAPs.   Preliminary estimates by the EEA indicate that, in 2015, fewer Member States exceeded their NREAP trajectories than in 2014 (19 compared with 22). In addition to the countries that did not reach their NREAP trajectory in 2014, four Member States (Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland and Spain) failed to stay above their trajectories in 2015.      Figure 5.2 National shares of energy from renewable sources in relation to trajectories from national action plans         Note: The countries are ranked by decreasing 2020 RES target levels. For Croatia, data on RES proportions were considerably different from those used in the 2015 assessment. This data revision, which took place in 2016 revealed significantly higher amounts of biomass consumption, which drove the proportion of renewable energy use upwards.   Source: EU, 2009; EC, 2013; EEA, 2011 and forthcoming; Eurostat, 2016.      5.3 Deployment of renewable energy between 2005 and 2014   The growth in the proportions of RES use in Member States during the 20052014 period is a combined result of the development of renewable energy use (in absolute terms), together with the decline in gross final energy consumption, in 27 Member States (see Figure 5.3). If gross final energy consumption was to increase without further RES deployment, the proportions of RES use would actually decrease.   Figure 5.3 Gross final energy consumption (total and from renewable sources) and shares of energy from renewable sources in Member States, 20052014          Note: In Malta, there was an increase in gross final energy consumption from renewable sources of 4193% between 2005 and 2014. Because of its absolute small size, however, the data may not be fully representative and are thus not represented above. The data on total gross final energy consumption take into account adjustments with regard to the amounts of energy consumed in aviation, as stipulated under the RED.   Source: Calculated from Eurostat, 2016.      5.4 Progress towards renewable energy source targets in the transport sector   The 10% RES-T target at EU level translates into RES-T targets of 10% for all Member States. In 2014, Finland (21.6%) and Sweden (19.2%) were the only two Member States with RES-T shares of more than 10%. In the other Member States, RES-T shares varied from 0.2% to 8.9%.   In Finland, the use of biofuels compliant with sustainability criteria( [2] ) increased significantly in 2014. In Sweden, fuel efficiency and renewable energy use in transport are stimulated through a number of tax incentives. Sweden has a high proportion of flexi-fuel vehicles, and numerous public buses run on ethanol and biogas. Sweden also has a high proportion of renewable electricity consumption in rail transport.   In 2015, the situation remained similar to that in 2014 according to approximated estimates. Apart from in Finland and Sweden, RES-T shares ranged from 0.2% to 8.3% in the other Member States (see Table A2.2 in Annex2).      5.5 Regional cooperation and flexibility mechanisms   According to the latest progress reports on renewable energy submitted by Member States in 2015, 15 Member States (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden) expect to produce more energy from renewable sources than planned, for at least one year, before 2020(   [3]   ). These Member States could, in principle, transfer any excesses to other Member States experiencing deficits. Several Member States have indicated that they would be willing to participate in such transfers.   In 2012, 2013 and 2014, statistical transfers between Norway and Sweden took place (Eurostat, 2016). Norway and Sweden created a joint electricity certificate market in 2012; according to this scheme, an electricity certificate issued in one country can be used to meet the quota obligation in the other country, and vice versa.   Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Portugal have also reported plans of joint projects or have expressed an interest in such projects. Denmark expected to establish a cooperation agreement with Germany in 2016, regarding the mutual opening of tenders for solar cells for plants located in the other country. In Germany, some tenders will be opened up to cross-border participation by foreign plants. In 2016, Latvia was planning to consider quantity and cooperation opportunities for statistical transfers of energy from RES in 2020. Lithuania signed a memorandum of understanding with Luxembourg in 2011 concerning cooperation on energy from renewable sources, including opportunities for statistical transfers and joint projects. Luxembourg reported that no final decision on a statistical transfer or a joint project had yet been taken for the 20132014 period, but has held and intensified target-oriented talks with various countries. Portugal registered an expression of intent to develop a joint project in the area of photovoltaic technology, but no agreement has been made so far between Portugal and other Member States.,5.1 Current progress towards renewable energy source targets In order to achieve the European Unions (EUs) objective of a 20% share of energy from renewable sources in its gross final energy consumption by 2020, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sets national targets for each Member State for 2020 (EU, 2009). These targets range from 10% (Malta) to 49% (Sweden). To monitor progress towards these 2020 targets, the RED sets indicative trajectories for the period from 2011 to 2020. These indicative trajectories are expressed as average shares for two-year periods from 2011 to 2018, in addition to the 2020 target. For the two-year period from 2013 to 2014, all Member States except one (the Netherlands) exceeded their indicative trajectory set in the RED (see Figure 5.1). According to approximated estimates from the European Environment Agency (EEA), the 2015 renewable energy source (RES) targets set in the indicative RED trajectories will not be met by three Member States (France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) for the two-year period from 2015 to 2016 (see Figure 5.2). It is still possible that these countries will stay on course with their indicative RED trajectories by achieving 2016 RES shares that are sufficient to bring the 20152016 averages above the trajectory values. When considering current RES shares in relation to 2020 targets, in 2014, nine Member States exceeded their national targets for 2020 set under the RED. These countries were Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Lithuania, Romania and Sweden (see Annex 2). According to preliminary estimates from the EEA, in 2015, Denmark also increased its RES share to a level above its 2020 RES target. Figure 5.1 National shares of energy from renewable sources in relation to indicative RED trajectories  Note: For Croatia, the share of energy from renewable sources changed considerably because of data revisions which took place in 2016. This revealed significantly higher amounts of biomass consumption which drove the proportion of renewable energy use upwards compared with the 2015 report. Source: EU, 2009; EC, 2013; EEA, 2011 and forthcoming; Eurostat, 2016.  5.2 Progress towards the objectives of national action plans Member States also set their own estimated trajectory in national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs), which they reported in 2010. These action plans concern the development of renewable energy at the national level, and include indicative trajectories as well as planned RES shares in the transport (RES-T), heating and cooling (RES-H/C), and electricity (RES-E) sectors. For most Member States, the anticipated trajectories set out in NREAPs are more ambitious than the indicative trajectories defined in the RED([1]). For example, the indicative RES target for the 20132014 period set out in the RED for Denmark is 20.9%, while this country planned to achieve a share of 27.3% for energy from renewable sources in 2014 according to its NREAP. By contrast, Greece, Latvia, Romania and the United Kingdom have designed trajectories in their NREAPs which are, for some years, lower than those set out in the RED. In 2014, 22 Member States reached or exceeded the RES targets outlined in their NREAPs for that year (see Figure 5.2).

"6-progress-of-the-european  6. Progress of the European Union towards its energy efficiency targets  This chapter presents the progress achieved by the European Union in reducing its energy consumption, in view of achieving its 2020 objective on energy efficiency  emissions trends and projections   6.1 Current progress in reducing energy consumption   The European Union (EU) is currently on track to achieve its target of improving energy efficiency by 20% by 2020. In 2014, it had reduced its primary[1]and final[2]energy consumption by 12.0% and 10.9%, respectively, compared with 2005 levels. According to preliminary estimates from the European Environment Agency (EEA), the EUs primary energy consumption increased slightly in 2015 (by 1% compared with 2014) and final energy consumption increased by 2.5% (EEA, 2016a and 2016b).   The Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) defines the EU energy efficiency target for 2020, which can be expressed in terms of either primary energy consumption or final energy consumption (EU, 2012). Meeting the target will require energy savings of 20% from levels projected for 2020 in the Commissions Energy Baseline Scenario (EC, 2008). The present analysis tracks progress towards the 2020 targets by measuring energy consumption against 2005 levels. Using this reference year allows consistency in the assessment towards 2020 climate and energy targets across the whole report, since 2005 is the base year for expressing national greenhouse gas (GHG) targets under the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD), as well as national targets under the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). The year 2005 is also a relevant starting point for monitoring trends in energy consumption, since, along with 2006, it is one of the two years in which EU energy consumption reached its highest levels ever.   The EUs 2020 target expressed in terms of final energy consumption corresponds to an 8.8% reduction from 2005 levels. In 2014, the EU had reduced its final energy consumption by 10.9% compared with 2005 levels, to levels below the target set for 2020. This corresponds to an annual decrease of 1.2% per year on average (see Figure 6.1).   The decrease in final energy consumption between 2005 and 2014 was influenced by a number of factors, such as structural changes towards less energy-intensive industrial sectors, improvements in end-use efficiency, lower energy consumption in the transport sector, as well as the economic recession (Odyssee-Mure, 2015). Furthermore, final energy consumption decreased by 4.1% in just one year, between 2013 and 2014. The year 2014 was exceptionally warm, which resulted in less demand for heating in Member States than in previous years.   The EUs 2020 target expressed in terms of primary energy consumption is equivalent to a 13.4% reduction from 2005 levels. In 2014, the EUs primary energy consumption was 11.8% lower than in 2005. The average annual reduction in the EUs primary energy consumption between 2005 and 2014 (of 1.3% per year) was more than the average annual reduction required to achieve the 2020 target (of 0.9% per year between 2005 and 2020). In other words, in 2014, the EUs primary energy consumption was below an indicative linear trajectory drawn between the actual consumption level in 2005 and the targeted level for 2020. According to preliminary estimates from the EEA, the EUs primary energy consumption slightly increased in 2015 (by 1% compared with 2014), although it still remained below the indicative linear trajectory (EEA, 2016b).   The 12% decrease in primary energy consumption between 2005 and 2014 was largely driven by the reduction in final energy consumption observed during that period. The other factors that contributed to this decrease are related to the production of final energy (e.g. electricity and heat) from primary energy as follows:     The efficiency of the conversion of primary sources (e.g. coal and gas) into final energy has improved.   There have been changes to the fuel mix for the production of electricity and heat:    The proportion of thermal generation (excluding combined heat and power (CHP)) has decreased.   The proportion of nuclear energy has decreased: the conversion efficiency of nuclear technology is considered lower than the average efficiency of thermal generation, so a decrease in the proportion of nuclear energy statistically improves the overall conversion efficiency of the energy system.   There proportion of renewable sources for electricity production (such as hydro, solar photovoltaic, wave and tidal, and wind) has increased: these renewable energy sources are considered to have 100% transformation efficiency, so an increasing proportion statistically improves the overall conversion efficiency of the system. The increase in the consumption of renewables from 2005  and the subsequent substitution of fossil fuels  is estimated to have contributed to a 2.0% reduction in primary energy consumption in 2014 (EEA, 2014).            Figure 6.1 Primary and final energy consumption in the EU, 20052015, 2020 and 2030 targets        Note: The 2020 target represents energy savings of 20% from levels projected for 2020 in the Commissions Energy Baseline Scenario (EC, 2008). The indicative 2030 energy efficiency target represents an improved energy efficiency of at least 27% compared with 2030 projections in the same Energy Baseline Scenario.     Source: EC, 2008; European Council, 2014; EEA, 2016a and 2016b; Eurostat, 2016a, 2016b and 2016c.       6.2Projected progress towards the European Union's 2020 energy efficiency target   No mechanism currently requires Member States to regularly report projections of their energy consumption levels. Assessing the projected progress of Member States  and subsequently of the EU  towards their energy efficiency targets based on Member States information, as is done for GHG emissions, is therefore not possible.   The EU will achieve its 2020 target on energy efficiency if the average annual decreases in primary and final energy consumption observed between 2005 and 2014 are maintained until 2020. This, however, may prove challenging considering the potential effects of an economic recovery and demographic trends on future energy consumption trends.   In its assessment of progress made by Member States towards the national energy efficiency targets for 2020, the European Commission concluded that, despite the achievements of previous years, additional efforts are needed, particularly in the building, transport and generation sectors. To close the remaining gap between current levels and the 2020 primary energy consumption target, Member States should accelerate their efforts in order to achieve their national energy efficiency targets for 2020, or go beyond them.   6.3 The 2030 targets on energy efficiency in the context of Energy Union   In October 2014, the European Council endorsed an indicative energy efficiency target of at least 27% for 2030, in comparison with the 2020 Energy Baseline Scenario target of the European Commission (European Council, 2014). This Energy Baseline Scenario, based on the Price-driven and Agent-based Simulation of Markets Energy System Models (PRIMES), was used to set the 20% target for 2020 (EC, 2011).   A 27% improvement of energy efficiency by 2030 corresponds to:     a primary energy consumption of 1369Mtoe in the EU, which is 20% lower than in 2005  this level corresponds to an average annual decrease of 0.8% per year between the 2020 target and 2030 (compared with a 0.9% average annual decrease between the 2005 level and the 2020 target);   a final energy consumption of 1039Mtoe, which is 13% lower than in 2005  this translates to a 0.4% average annual decrease between the 2020 target and 2030 (compared with the 0.6% average annual reduction between 2005 and the 2020 target).     Considering this, actual reduction targets for 2030 are less ambitious than those for 2020 because the average annual reduction rates are lower than those required for the achievement of the 2020 targets. A 27% energy efficiency target could be reached by 2030 by continuing, beyond 2020, the efforts made to reduce the EUs primary energy consumption between 2005 and 2020. Achieving the final energy consumption target in 2030 requires only a 2.2% reduction from 2014 levels.   The target will be reviewed in 2016, following a review of the EED. A 30% improvement of energy efficiency by 2030 would correspond to a 23% decrease in primary energy consumption or to a 16% decrease in final energy consumption, compared with 2005. Individual Member States are also free to set their own higher national targets.,6.1 Current progress in reducing energy consumption The European Union (EU) is currently on track to achieve its target of improving energy efficiency by 20% by 2020. In 2014, it had reduced its primary[1]and final[2]energy consumption by 12.0% and 10.9%, respectively, compared with 2005 levels. According to preliminary estimates from the European Environment Agency (EEA), the EUs primary energy consumption increased slightly in 2015 (by 1% compared with 2014) and final energy consumption increased by 2.5% (EEA, 2016a and 2016b). The Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) defines the EU energy efficiency target for 2020, which can be expressed in terms of either primary energy consumption or final energy consumption (EU, 2012). Meeting the target will require energy savings of 20% from levels projected for 2020 in the Commissions Energy Baseline Scenario (EC, 2008).

In other words, in 2014, the EUs primary energy consumption was below an indicative linear trajectory drawn between the actual consumption level in 2005 and the targeted level for 2020. According to preliminary estimates from the EEA, the EUs primary energy consumption slightly increased in 2015 (by 1% compared with 2014), although it still remained below the indicative linear trajectory (EEA, 2016b).

Progress towards Member States' energy efficiency targets  This chapter presents the progress achieved by EU Member States towards their national targets on primary energy consumption. Member States had to set these indicative, non-binding targets on primary or final energy consumption for 2020 under the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED).  emissions trends and projections   7.1 Progress towards national primary energy consumption targets   In order to achieve the European Unions (EUs) objective of reducing its energy consumption by 20% compared with the baseline scenario by 2020, the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) requires Member States to set their own national non-binding targets for either primary or final energy consumption for 2020 (EU, 2012). For primary energy consumption, Member States have set targets that range from a 24% reduction (Malta) to a 22% increase (Croatia) compared with 2005 levels. A total of 21 Member States have targets to decrease primary energy consumption, while the 2020 primary energy consumption targets of seven Member States (Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Poland, Romania and Slovenia) are higher than 2005 levels [1]. Member States can also revise their targets upwards or downwards at any point in time.   As neither Member States nor EU legislation set any indicative trajectory to monitor the progress of Member States towards their national 2020 targets, this analysis tracks progress to energy efficiency targets by considering, for each Member State, an indicative linear trajectory between 2005 primary energy consumption levels and 2020 targets, and by comparing historic levels of primary energy consumption with this linear trajectory. A country is considered to be on track towards meeting its 2020 target if its primary energy consumption is below its linear trajectory. Conversely, a country with primary energy consumption levels above its linear trajectory needs to reduce or limit its energy consumption at a faster pace, in order to meet its 2020 objective.   Between 2005 and 2014, primary energy consumption decreased in 25 Member States. It increased in only Estonia, Finland and Poland. In 2014, 25 Member States reduced or limited the increase in their primary energy consumption to levels below their corresponding linear trajectories between 2005 levels and 2020 targets (see Figure 7.1). If maintained until 2020, the pace of reductions (or limited increases) observed since 2005 should allow these countries to meet their 2020 targets. However, in Estonia, Malta and Sweden, primary energy consumption in 2014 was above these countries linear 20052020 trajectories. In Estonia, which adopted a target equivalent to a 21% increase by 2020, primary energy consumption had increased by 23% in 2014 compared with 2005 levels. Based on the European Environment Agency (EEA) energy efficiency index (EEA, forthcoming), these countries could improve their 2020 outlook by paying particular attention to the residential sector (Sweden), and the services and transport sectors (Malta). In Estonia, improvements could be made particularly to the energy transformation and buildings sectors.   In 2015, primary energy consumption increased in 19 Member States according to preliminary estimates from the EEA (EEA, 2016). One reason for these increases is the rebound in energy consumption for heating in 2015, after the exceptionally warm winter of 2014. Although Germanys primary energy consumption decreased slightly, it passed above the linear trajectory for this country. Bulgaria and France also saw their consumption pass above their linear trajectories because their energy consumption increased by 3% and 2%, respectively. The situation seems to have improved for Estonia and Sweden in 2015. With the two largest annual decreases across the EU (11% and 8%, respectively), these two countries are expected to see their primary energy consumption pass below their corresponding linear trajectories in 2015.   In 2014, 13 of the 21 Member States (Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain), which had set reduction targets for 2020 compared with 2005, had already reached a level of primary energy consumption that is below their 2020 targets. According to preliminary estimates, all of these countries, except Austria, Cyprus and Ireland, are thought to have remained in this situation in 2015. Furthermore, four of the seven Member States that had set 2020 targets that are higher than 2005 levels (Croatia, Latvia, Romania and Slovenia) actually reduced their primary energy consumption between 2005 and 2014.   Member States have already put in place a wide range of energy efficiency measures that should go a long way towards meeting the 2020 energy efficiency objective; however, the challenge remains to fully implement and enforce these measures at the national level, particularly in the event of an economic recovery. Furthermore, Member States will need to achieve reductions beyond their targets if the EU is to meet its overall 2020 energy efficiency target related to primary energy (see section 7.2).   In 2015 and 2016, Member States adopted new measures or improved existing ones in order to fully implement the EED. This is a clear signal that the EU framework plays a key role in driving energy efficiency improvements. To overcome common barriers associated with energy efficiency improvements, such as a lack of transparency in the energy market, inadequate pricing of externalities and insufficient financing, Member States should emphasise the multiple benefits of energy efficiency, such as enhancing the sustainability of the energy system, supporting strategic objectives for economic and social development (e.g. job creation), increasing well-being (e.g. health benefits and enhanced well-being resulting from retrofitting buildings) and promoting environmental goals (EEA, 2014).   Figure 7.1 Primary energy consumption and linear trajectory levels, 20142015          Note: The figure compares, for each Member State, primary energy consumption levels for a given year and the level of the indicative linear trajectory between 2005 and the relevant 2020 target on primary energy consumption.     Source: EC, 2015 and 2016; EEA, 2016; Eurostat, 2016b and 2016c.       7.2 Progress towards national final energy consumption targets   National 2020 targets on final energy consumption set by Member States under the EED range from 22% (Slovakia) to +43% (Malta) compared with 2005 levels. As for primary energy consumption, linear trajectories between 2005 levels and 2020 targets can be used to track the progress of Member States towards these targets. Paradoxically, of all Member States Malta has both the most stringent reduction target for primary energy consumption by 2020 (a 24% reduction compared with 2005 levels) and the most lenient target for final energy consumption (a 43% increase) by that same year.   Although the EUs 2020 target on final energy consumption was already reached in 2014, a number of Member States still need to pursue their efforts to further reduce or limit their own consumption. In 2014, 24 Member States stood on or below their target paths. However, Austria, Germany, Lithuania and Slovakia had not sufficiently reduced their final energy consumption to stay below their trajectories. Despite a target of a 43% increase by 2020 compared with 2005, Malta had already let its final energy consumption increase by more than 42% by 2014, far exceeding the linear trajectory from 2005 to the 2020 target.      7.3 Aggregated ambition level of Member States national 2020 targets   Taken together, the sum of all individual 2020 targets from Member States for their primary energy consumption add up to an overall EU level (of 1526Mtoe), which remains 3% higher than the target defined for the EU under the EED (1483Mtoe) [2] (see Figure 7.2). This is a clear sign of the insufficient ambition of some Member States. It is difficult to determine specifically which Member States lack ambition, as national targets are not directly comparable, since they are set based on different baselines and take into account different national circumstances (including early measures), in addition to political ambition.   For final energy consumption, the sum of all 2020 targets from the 28 Member States (1077Mtoe) is 1% lower than the EU target for final energy consumption (1086Mtoe) (see Figure 7.2). Therefore, achieving these national targets would now be sufficient to reach the EU-level target for final energy consumption  this was not the case in the 2015 analysis (EEA, 2015). This is the consequence of the revision, in 2016, of targets by three Member States (Denmark, Hungary and Ireland); in 2015, the sum of Member States targets for final energy consumption was above the EU target.   Figure 7.2 Overall ambition level of national targets for primary and final energy consumption by 2020          Note: The Member States grouped as Other Member States are those that have a 2020 target for primary energy consumption lower than 20Mtoe and a 2020 target for final energy consumption lower than 15Mtoe. In order of decreasing magnitude of 2020 targets, these countries are Denmark, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Ireland, Croatia, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Luxembourg, Cyprus and Malta.

"4-progress-of-the-european  4. Progress of the European Union towards its renewable energy targets  This chapter presents the progress achieved by the European Union in developing renewable energy, in view of achieving its 2020 target. It also presents information on the development of renewable energy specifically for electricity, heating and cooling, and transport.   4.1 Current progress on renewable energy   The European Union (EU) is currently on track to meet its target of reaching, by 2020, a 20% share of energy from renewable energy in its gross final energy consumption[1]. In 2014, the use of renewable energy sources (RESs) in the EU, as a proportion of gross final energy consumption, continued its steady growth, standing at 16.0% of gross final energy consumption. This is an increase of one percentage point from the previous year. According to preliminary estimates from the European Environment Agency (EEA), the share of energy from renewable sources in the EUs gross final consumption of energy continued to increase in 2015, reaching a level of 16.4%.   The Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sets national targets for 2020 for all Member States (EU, 2009). These national targets, ranging from 10% for Malta to 49% for Sweden, reflect differing national circumstances and starting points. To ensure that these 2020 targets are achieved, the RED also sets indicative trajectories for the period between 2011 and 2020. Member States may reach their indicative RED targets domestically (by establishing adequate RES support measures) and through cooperation with other countries (between local, regional and national authorities; planned statistical transfers; or joint projects).   The average RES share of 15.5% achieved in the EU over the two-year period from 2013 to 2014 exceeded the average share from the indicative trajectory for these two consecutive years, as set in the RED (12.1%). It also exceeded the indicative average share of 13.8% set for the 20152016 period. Moreover, the RES share of 16.0% in 2014 was also higher than the level that Member States had planned to achieve by 2014 and 2015 (14.5% and 15.3%, respectively), according to the roadmaps reported in their 2010 national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs).   Between 2005 and 2014, the use of energy from renewable sources, as a proportion of gross final energy consumption, increased by, on average, 0.8 percentage point every year. This steady increase reflects a combination of two trends: dynamic developments in the use of renewable energy (in absolute terms), together with a decrease in final energy consumption. While the consumption of renewable energy grew by more than 59% between 2005 and 2014, total final energy consumption decreased by 10% during the same period (see Figure 4.1). Between 2013 and 2014, the consumption of renewable energy increased by 3Mtoe (from 172Mtoe to 175Mtoe), while the consumption of non-renewable sources fell from 973Mtoe to 923Mtoe. The 17% decrease in the gross final energy consumption of non-renewable sources between 2005 and 2014 clearly indicates a progressive substitution of fossil fuels by renewables.   Figure 4.1 Gross final energy consumption from renewable and non-renewable energy sources, 20052015           Note: Eurostat calculates the shares of RES consumption and as part of this process normalises wind power and hydroelectricity generation, which are part of the RES share numerator. However, the total consumption of electricity included in the denominator is not normalised. In the figure above, non-normalised gross final energy consumption is displayed together with shares of RES consumption in which the numerator has been normalised.     The 2015 data are approximated estimates from the EEA.     Source: EU, 2009; Eurostat, 2016; EEA, forthcoming.       4.2 Projected progress in the deployment of renewable energy sources   If the average annual increase in RES share observed between 2005 and 2014 is maintained until 2020, the EU will achieve its 2020 target. This, however, may prove challenging, because of recent changes in national RES supporting policies, and persisting market barriers for new projects. Other complex factors are also at play, with uncertain outcomes. In particular, relatively low-priced RES development options are becoming scarcer as the easiest and least expensive options are gradually being exhausted. At the same time, costs for new RES capacity are being reduced through economies of scale, better knowledge integration and increasing experience.   According to their 2010 action plans and biennial progress reports[2], Member States plan to increase the share of energy from renewable sources at EU level to approximately 21% by 2020. However, not all Member States reported RES projections, or specified the status of the policies and measures (e.g. existing or planned) on which their projections were based. This makes it difficult to use the RES projections to assess progress towards RES targets for all Member States in a consistent manner, as is done for GHG emissions.   Furthermore, NREAPs and current RES projections do not reflect the recently endorsed objective to increase the EU-wide share of RES consumption to a minimum of 27% by 2030. In this respect, current national documents offer limited information regarding the continuation of efforts foreseen by countries after 2020. The European Commission is expected to make a proposal for a revised RED in December 2016.   Beyond 2030, the EU has no quantified target for renewable energy. However, in order to achieve the goal of reducing EU-wide GHG emissions by 8095% below 1990 levels by 2050, the share of RES in the EU will need to increase significantly, to levels of between 55% and 75% of gross final energy consumption by 2050 (see Figure 4.2), in accordance with the decarbonisation scenarios presented in the European Commissions communicationEnergy Roadmap 2050(EC, 2011a and 2011b). Achieving such a high proportion of RES consumption calls for considerably higher efforts post 2030, as the required pace of RES growth would have to be up to three times that achieved between 2005 and 2014. A higher penetration of renewables before 2030 would balance the pace of growth required before 2050, but further policy efforts and investments would be required in the short term.   The transport sector represents one particular challenge. Because of its significant reliance on fossil fuel-based technologies and infrastructures, progress in developing the use of renewable energy and reducing GHG emissions in this sector has been relatively limited in the EU to date (see section 3.4).      Figure 4.2 Share of energy from renewable sources in EUs gross final energy consumption, 20052050           Source: EC, 2011b, 2013a and 2013b; EU, 2009; EEA, 2011 and forthcoming; Eurostat, 2016.       4.3 The development of renewable energy for electricity, heating and cooling, and transport   RESs are used in power generation, the heating and cooling sector, and the transport sector. In addition to the overall 20% target for renewable energy use in all sectors by 2020, a 10% target must also be achieved specifically in the transport sector, by all Member States. However, progress in this sector is much slower than if all sectors are considered together.   Between 2005 and 2014, with regard to electricity consumed in the EU, the RES share grew at an average of 1.4 percentage points per year. In 2014, more than 27% of the electricity consumed in the EU was generated from renewables, with about 41% of that from variable renewable electricity (wind and solar power). For 2015, EEA estimates indicate that more than 28% of total electricity consumed was derived from RESs, with more than 42% of this from wind and solar power (EEA, forthcoming).   In the EU heating and cooling sector, the RES share grew on average by 0.8 percentage points per year between 2005 and 2014. The share of energy from renewable sources used in this sector amounted to 17.7% in 2014, and was estimated to have been 18% in 2015 (EEA, forthcoming). Heating from RESs is increasingly being used as a cost-efficient and secure alternative to fossil fuels (mainly natural gas) in Member States for district heating and at local levels.   In 2014, renewable energy represented only 5.9% of energy consumption in the transport sector (see Figure 4.3). According to preliminary estimates from the EEA, this proportion increased marginally in 2015, up to 6.0%. After rapid growth between 2005 and 2010, the proportion of RES use in transport (RES-T) dropped in 2011 and has been increasing at a slower pace since 2012. This can be explained by a number of factors, including the following:     The legal framework concerning energy from biofuels produced from crops grown on agricultural land primarily for energy purposes remained uncertain until a political agreement was reached in 2012. A cap on the use of these fuels was adopted in 2015: such fuels should account for a maximum of 7% of final energy consumption in transport by 2020 (EU, 2015a and 2015b). In 2017, each Member State will need to set a national target for advanced biofuels (e.g. fuels made from waste or algae).   The use of biofuels to reduce GHG emissions remains a relatively high-cost option. For example, it is estimated (not considering the indirect emissions related to land use change) that the mitigation costs of biodiesel would be in the range of EUR100 to EUR330 per avoided tonne of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ); for bioethanol fuels from sugars and straw, costs would range from EUR100 to EUR200 per tonne of avoided CO 2  (JRC, 2015).

The 2015 data are approximated estimates from the EEA.     Source: EU, 2009; Eurostat, 2016; EEA, forthcoming.,4.1 Current progress on renewable energy The European Union (EU) is currently on track to meet its target of reaching, by 2020, a 20% share of energy from renewable energy in its gross final energy consumption[1]. In 2014, the use of renewable energy sources (RESs) in the EU, as a proportion of gross final energy consumption, continued its steady growth, standing at 16.0% of gross final energy consumption. This is an increase of one percentage point from the previous year. According to preliminary estimates from the European Environment Agency (EEA), the share of energy from renewable sources in the EUs gross final consumption of energy continued to increase in 2015, reaching a level of 16.4%. The Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sets national targets for 2020 for all Member States (EU, 2009). These national targets, ranging from 10% for Malta to 49% for Sweden, reflect differing national circumstances and starting points. To ensure that these 2020 targets are achieved, the RED also sets indicative trajectories for the period between 2011 and 2020. Member States may reach their indicative RED targets domestically (by establishing adequate RES support measures) and through cooperation with other countries (between local, regional and national authorities; planned statistical transfers; or joint projects). The average RES share of 15.5% achieved in the EU over the two-year period from 2013 to 2014 exceeded the average share from the indicative trajectory for these two consecutive years, as set in the RED (12.1%). It also exceeded the indicative average share of 13.8% set for the 20152016 period. Moreover, the RES share of 16.0% in 2014 was also higher than the level that Member States had planned to achieve by 2014 and 2015 (14.5% and 15.3%, respectively), according to the roadmaps reported in their 2010 national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs). Between 2005 and 2014, the use of energy from renewable sources, as a proportion of gross final energy consumption, increased by, on average, 0.8 percentage point every year. This steady increase reflects a combination of two trends: dynamic developments in the use of renewable energy (in absolute terms), together with a decrease in final energy consumption. While the consumption of renewable energy grew by more than 59% between 2005 and 2014, total final energy consumption decreased by 10% during the same period (see Figure 4.1). Between 2013 and 2014, the consumption of renewable energy increased by 3Mtoe (from 172Mtoe to 175Mtoe), while the consumption of non-renewable sources fell from 973Mtoe to 923Mtoe. The 17% decrease in the gross final energy consumption of non-renewable sources between 2005 and 2014 clearly indicates a progressive substitution of fossil fuels by renewables.

This, however, may prove challenging, because of recent changes in national RES supporting policies, and persisting market barriers for new projects. Other complex factors are also at play, with uncertain outcomes. In particular, relatively low-priced RES development options are becoming scarcer as the easiest and least expensive options are gradually being exhausted. At the same time, costs for new RES capacity are being reduced through economies of scale, better knowledge integration and increasing experience. According to their 2010 action plans and biennial progress reports[2], Member States plan to increase the share of energy from renewable sources at EU level to approximately 21% by 2020. However, not all Member States reported RES projections, or specified the status of the policies and measures (e.g. existing or planned) on which their projections were based. This makes it difficult to use the RES projections to assess progress towards RES targets for all Member States in a consistent manner, as is done for GHG emissions. Furthermore, NREAPs and current RES projections do not reflect the recently endorsed objective to increase the EU-wide share of RES consumption to a minimum of 27% by 2030. In this respect, current national documents offer limited information regarding the continuation of efforts foreseen by countries after 2020. The European Commission is expected to make a proposal for a revised RED in December 2016. Beyond 2030, the EU has no quantified target for renewable energy. However, in order to achieve the goal of reducing EU-wide GHG emissions by 8095% below 1990 levels by 2050, the share of RES in the EU will need to increase significantly, to levels of between 55% and 75% of gross final energy consumption by 2050 (see Figure 4.2), in accordance with the decarbonisation scenarios presented in the European Commissions communicationEnergy Roadmap 2050(EC, 2011a and 2011b). Achieving such a high proportion of RES consumption calls for considerably higher efforts post 2030, as the required pace of RES growth would have to be up to three times that achieved between 2005 and 2014. A higher penetration of renewables before 2030 would balance the pace of growth required before 2050, but further policy efforts and investments would be required in the short term. The transport sector represents one particular challenge. Because of its significant reliance on fossil fuel-based technologies and infrastructures, progress in developing the use of renewable energy and reducing GHG emissions in this sector has been relatively limited in the EU to date (see section 3.4).  Figure 4.2 Share of energy from renewable sources in EUs gross final energy consumption, 20052050   Source: EC, 2011b, 2013a and 2013b; EU, 2009; EEA, 2011 and forthcoming; Eurostat, 2016.  4.3 The development of renewable energy for electricity, heating and cooling, and transport RESs are used in power generation, the heating and cooling sector, and the transport sector. In addition to the overall 20% target for renewable energy use in all sectors by 2020, a 10% target must also be achieved specifically in the transport sector, by all Member States. However, progress in this sector is much slower than if all sectors are considered together. Between 2005 and 2014, with regard to electricity consumed in the EU, the RES share grew at an average of 1.4 percentage points per year. In 2014, more than 27% of the electricity consumed in the EU was generated from renewables, with about 41% of that from variable renewable electricity (wind and solar power). For 2015, EEA estimates indicate that more than 28% of total electricity consumed was derived from RESs, with more than 42% of this from wind and solar power (EEA, forthcoming). In the EU heating and cooling sector, the RES share grew on average by 0.8 percentage points per year between 2005 and 2014. The share of energy from renewable sources used in this sector amounted to 17.7% in 2014, and was estimated to have been 18% in 2015 (EEA, forthcoming). Heating from RESs is increasingly being used as a cost-efficient and secure alternative to fossil fuels (mainly natural gas) in Member States for district heating and at local levels. In 2014, renewable energy represented only 5.9% of energy consumption in the transport sector (see Figure 4.3). According to preliminary estimates from the EEA, this proportion increased marginally in 2015, up to 6.0%. After rapid growth between 2005 and 2010, the proportion of RES use in transport (RES-T) dropped in 2011 and has been increasing at a slower pace since 2012. This can be explained by a number of factors, including the following:  The legal framework concerning energy from biofuels produced from crops grown on agricultural land primarily for energy purposes remained uncertain until a political agreement was reached in 2012. A cap on the use of these fuels was adopted in 2015: such fuels should account for a maximum of 7% of final energy consumption in transport by 2020 (EU, 2015a and 2015b). In 2017, each Member State will need to set a national target for advanced biofuels (e.g. fuels made from waste or algae). The use of biofuels to reduce GHG emissions remains a relatively high-cost option. For example, it is estimated (not considering the indirect emissions related to land use change) that the mitigation costs of biodiesel would be in the range of EUR100 to EUR330 per avoided tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2); for bioethanol fuels from sugars and straw, costs would range from EUR100 to EUR200 per tonne of avoided CO2 (JRC, 2015).

"1-overall-progress-towards-the  1. Overall progress towards the European Union's '20-20-20' climate and energy targets  This chapter presents a synthetic overview of the progress achieved by the EU and its Member States in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the use of energy from renewable sources and reducing energy consumption, in view of their 2020 targets.  emissions trends and projections   1.1 Progress of the European Union towards its '20-20-20' climate and energy targets   Based on the analysis of data and information reported by Member States in 2015 and 2016, as well as additional estimates from the European Environment Agency (EEA), the European Union (EU) is on course to meet each of its 2020 targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency. In fact, the GHG target was already surpassed in 2014 and 2015 (see Figure 1.1).   GHG emissions   In 2014, the EU achieved a reduction of GHG emissions to 23% below 1990 levels. This reduction exceeds the 20% reduction target set for 2020. Approximated estimates for 2015 indicate that GHG emissions slightly increased in 2015, but remained well below the 2020 target level, at 22% below 1990 levels. This increase observed in 2015 follows an exceptionally warm year (in 2014) in almost all parts of Europe, which resulted in a markedly low demand for heating energy compared with 2013. As such, the 20142015 trend can be considered a recovery from the exceptional decrease in emissions recorded in 2014. Further details of this are discussed in Chapter 2.   Renewable energy   The steady deployment of renewable energy sources (RESs) in the EUs energy mix continues. The use of renewable energy continued to increase, standing at 16.0% of gross final energy consumption in 2014 and getting closer to the 20% target for 2020. This 2014 RES percentage is higher than indicative levels set for that year in both the Renewable Energy Directive (RED)[1]and Member States national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs). In fact, approximated estimates for 2015 indicate that the use of energy from renewable sources continued to increase, standing at 16.4% of gross final energy consumption. The 2020 target could be attained if Member States sustain the speed at which they have been developing RESs so far. However, as we approach 2020, the trajectories for meeting the national targets are becoming steeper and more costly projects will have to be developed; however, market barriers persist in several Member States. Further details of this are discussed in Chapter 4.   Energy efficiency   The EU is reducing its energy consumption. Since 2005, the EUs primary energy consumption has been decreasing at a pace which, if sustained until 2020, would be sufficient for the EU to meet its 20% primary energy target. Final energy consumption in 2014 was already below the target defined for 2020. For this trend to continue at EU level, several Member States must reinforce their implementation of European legislation. EU primary energy consumption decreased in 2014 and was 12% below 2005 levels. However, this decrease can be partly explained by the warmer temperatures in 2014 than in 2013. Based upon approximated estimates for 2015, levels of primary energy consumption slightly increased again relative to the previous year, to a level 11% below 2005. Further details of this are discussed in Chapter 6.   Figure 1.1 EU progress towards 2020 climate and energy targets       Note: The energy efficiency target for 2020 is defined as an absolute target, set at 20% below the level in primary energy consumption projected for 2020 in the 2007 Energy Baseline Scenario of the European Commission. In this figure, this target is expressed as a relative change compared with 2005 levels of primary energy consumption in the EU, in order to show the required reduction in primary energy consumption over time. The year 2005 was chosen because it is used as a base year for GHG emission (in the EU ETS and under the ESD) and renewable energy targets. It also corresponds to a peak in energy consumption in the EU.   Source: EC, 2013; EEA, 2011, 2016a, 2016b, 2016c and 2016d; EU, 2009 and 2012; European Council, 2007; Eurostat, 2016a, 2016b and 2016c.      1.2 Progress towards the European Union'smid- and long-term climate and energy objectives   Although the EU and its Member States are making good progress towards their short-term goals on climate and energy, efforts will need to be considerably increased to meet the EUs long-term goal for 2050 of reducing Europes GHG emissions by 8095%, compared with 1990 levels.   To ensure that the EU is on a cost-effective track towards meeting this long-term objective, the European Council (i.e. the EU heads of state or government) agreed, in October 2014, on a climate and energy policy framework for the EU, and endorsed new climate and energy targets for 2030 (European Council, 2014). The framework includes:     a binding target of at least a 40% reduction in domestic GHG emissions, compared with 1990 levels, with individual targets at the Member State level;   a target for RES consumption to be at least 27% of final energy consumption by 2030; this target is binding at EU level, but there are no fixed targets for individual Member States;   an indicative target at EU level of at least a 27% improvement in energy efficiency in 2030 compared with projections of future energy consumption (based on the European Commissions 2007 Energy Baseline Scenario (EC, 2008)), which is equivalent to a reduction of primary energy consumption by about 20% compared with 2005 levels. For final energy consumption, the 2030 target would be equivalent to a 12% decrease from 2005 levels. This target will be reviewed in 2016, with an EU level of 30% in mind.     Progress towards these 2030 targets is not as evident as it is for 2020 targets:     According to Member States projections, a reduction of EU GHG emissions of between 26% (on the basis of existing mitigation measures) and 29% (accounting for planned national measures) could be achieved by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. These projected reductions fall short of the 40% target for 2030. In the sectors covered by the Effort Sharing legislation (i.e. not under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)), the projected reductions for 2030, estimated to be between 16% and 19% compared with 2005 levels, would also fall short of the necessary 30% reduction in these sectors.   Maintaining the current pace of RES deployment across Europe would enable the EU to achieve RES consumption above the target of 27% of final energy consumption in 2030. However, this may not happen without additional efforts, because a number of regulatory changes have already affected investors confidence in renewables, and market barriers and fragmentation still represent challenges for new entrants.   From 2020 onwards, the average reductions in both primary and final energy consumption necessary to reach the 2030 targets are slightly lower than those needed between 2005 and 2020 to meet the 2020 energy consumption target. Achieving the 2030 targets nevertheless requires not only the stringent implementation of energy efficiency measures, but also a rapid change in consumer behaviour.     Even if the 2030 EU targets are met, efforts would still need to be further enhanced in view of the EUs energy and decarbonisation objectives for 2050. After 2030, GHG emissions would need to decline at a much faster pace than anticipated today in order to reach the 2050 long-term goal, and renewable energy would need to grow even faster before 2050 in order to attain the minimum levels consistent with the EUs long-term decarbonisation objectives.      1.3 Towards more integrated governance of climate and energy policies in the European Union   The EUs 2030 climate and energy policy framework contributes to achieving the objectives of the EUs Energy Union Framework Strategy (EC, 2015b), which was adopted in 2015. The strategy aims to ensure that Europe moves towards an integrated, secure, affordable and climate-compatible energy system, and achieves its climate and energy goals for 2030. It is structured around five closely related and mutually reinforcing dimensions:     supply security;   internal energy market integration;   energy efficiency;   decarbonisation;   research and innovation.     Progress towards these objectives is monitored annually through the European Commissions State of the Energy Union (EC, 2015a). On 30 November 2016, the European Commission also tables a legislative proposal on a new governance under the Energy Union in order to adapt planning, reporting and monitoring requirements to the new 2030 climate and energy framework (under EU legislation and the Paris Agreement[2]). It will specifically aim to streamline the existing planning, reporting and monitoring obligations of Member States and to minimise administrative burden. This streamlining effort is expected to ensure the availability of integrated and coherent national data and information on GHG emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency. This includes projections, as well as anticipated and realised effects of policies and measures. Such information will, in turn, improve the robustness of the assessment of progress towards the climate and energy targets presented in this report.      1.4 Progress of Member States towards national 2020 climate and energy objectives   Not all Member States are performing well individually with respect to their national targets (see Table 1.1). However, the projected overachievements of the majority of Member States offset the slower progress projected in a few Member States. The Member States progress is summarised below:     In 2014, all of the Member States, with the exception of Malta, met their annual GHG emission targets set under the ESD[3]. Proxy estimates indicate that a similar situation also occurred in 2015. A total of 23 Member States project that they will meet their national GHG targets in 2020 with the current set of policies and measures in place. The other five Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg) will have to implement additional measures to reach targets domestically or use the flexibility mechanisms provided under the ESD. These mechanisms allow Member States to transfer annual emission allowances over time and between Member States. Further details of this are provided in Chapter 3.   A total of 22 Member States were making good progress towards their national renewable energy targets in 2014, but France, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal were behind the trajectories they had set in their national action plans. Furthermore, the Netherlands were also behind their indicative trajectory set in the RED. The situation is expected to have changed in 2015, with only 19 Member States remaining on track, according to proxy estimates by the EEA. Further details of this are discussed in Chapter 5.   All but three (Estonia, Malta and Sweden) Member States were making good progress towards indicative national targets on primary energy consumption in 2014. However, as primary consumption increased across Europe in 2015, according to EEA proxy estimates, four countries were expected to fall behind their energy efficiency targets in 2015. Further details are provided in Chapter 7.     In total, 16 Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom) were on track in 2014 to meet all three of their national climate and energy targets for 2020 (see Table 1.1). Ten of these countries need to limit only their GHG emissions or energy consumption, compared with 2005, to achieve their 2020 targets[4]. However, based on approximated estimates, not all of these 16 Member States remained on track in all three domains in 2015.   As opposed to previous years, in which no Member State underperformed in all three domains, Malta was found to be in a difficult situation in 2014, as it failed to keep its GHG emissions below its ESD target and has fallen behind trajectories for achieving its 2020 targets on renewable energy and energy consumption.   Strong links exist between energy efficiency improvements, the deployment of renewable energy and reductions in GHG emissions. However, not all of the GHG emission savings resulting from better energy efficiency and more renewable energy use contribute to Member States progress towards their national targets since these relate to only sectors which are not covered under the EU ETS. For example, most GHG savings resulting from the growth in the use of renewable energy take place in the power sector, which is covered under the EU ETS (EEA, 2016e). The link between the GHG emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency targets is therefore stronger at EU level, for which all emissions are considered in the 20% reduction target, than at Member State level, for which national targets do not cover ETS emissions. Renewable and energy efficiency policies nevertheless contribute to reducing emissions in the sectors covered by the ESD, particularly the transport and building sectors. Energy efficiency improvements and the development of RESs have played roles of varying importance from one Member State to another with regard to making progress towards national ESD targets (EEA, 2015).    Table 11 Progress of Member States towards 2020 climate and energy targets            Note: The percentage values in this table represent the difference between the parameter considered and the relevant target or indicative target. A positive value indicates that a target is met. Further methodological details on how progress is measured are provided in Annexes 1, 2 and 3.

See Chapters 3, 5 and 7 for further details, as well as Annexes 1, 2 and 3 for information on data and methodology.,1.1 Progress of the European Union towards its '20-20-20' climate and energy targets Based on the analysis of data and information reported by Member States in 2015 and 2016, as well as additional estimates from the European Environment Agency (EEA), the European Union (EU) is on course to meet each of its 2020 targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency. In fact, the GHG target was already surpassed in 2014 and 2015 (see Figure 1.1). GHG emissions In 2014, the EU achieved a reduction of GHG emissions to 23% below 1990 levels. This reduction exceeds the 20% reduction target set for 2020. Approximated estimates for 2015 indicate that GHG emissions slightly increased in 2015, but remained well below the 2020 target level, at 22% below 1990 levels. This increase observed in 2015 follows an exceptionally warm year (in 2014) in almost all parts of Europe, which resulted in a markedly low demand for heating energy compared with 2013. As such, the 20142015 trend can be considered a recovery from the exceptional decrease in emissions recorded in 2014. Further details of this are discussed in Chapter 2. Renewable energy The steady deployment of renewable energy sources (RESs) in the EUs energy mix continues. The use of renewable energy continued to increase, standing at 16.0% of gross final energy consumption in 2014 and getting closer to the 20% target for 2020. This 2014 RES percentage is higher than indicative levels set for that year in both the Renewable Energy Directive (RED)[1]and Member States national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs). In fact, approximated estimates for 2015 indicate that the use of energy from renewable sources continued to increase, standing at 16.4% of gross final energy consumption. The 2020 target could be attained if Member States sustain the speed at which they have been developing RESs so far. However, as we approach 2020, the trajectories for meeting the national targets are becoming steeper and more costly projects will have to be developed; however, market barriers persist in several Member States. Further details of this are discussed in Chapter 4. Energy efficiency The EU is reducing its energy consumption. Since 2005, the EUs primary energy consumption has been decreasing at a pace which, if sustained until 2020, would be sufficient for the EU to meet its 20% primary energy target. Final energy consumption in 2014 was already below the target defined for 2020. For this trend to continue at EU level, several Member States must reinforce their implementation of European legislation. EU primary energy consumption decreased in 2014 and was 12% below 2005 levels. However, this decrease can be partly explained by the warmer temperatures in 2014 than in 2013. Based upon approximated estimates for 2015, levels of primary energy consumption slightly increased again relative to the previous year, to a level 11% below 2005. Further details of this are discussed in Chapter 6. Figure 1.1 EU progress towards 2020 climate and energy targets  Note: The energy efficiency target for 2020 is defined as an absolute target, set at 20% below the level in primary energy consumption projected for 2020 in the 2007 Energy Baseline Scenario of the European Commission. In this figure, this target is expressed as a relative change compared with 2005 levels of primary energy consumption in the EU, in order to show the required reduction in primary energy consumption over time. The year 2005 was chosen because it is used as a base year for GHG emission (in the EU ETS and under the ESD) and renewable energy targets. It also corresponds to a peak in energy consumption in the EU.

To ensure that the EU is on a cost-effective track towards meeting this long-term objective, the European Council (i.e. the EU heads of state or government) agreed, in October 2014, on a climate and energy policy framework for the EU, and endorsed new climate and energy targets for 2030 (European Council, 2014). The framework includes:  a binding target of at least a 40% reduction in domestic GHG emissions, compared with 1990 levels, with individual targets at the Member State level; a target for RES consumption to be at least 27% of final energy consumption by 2030; this target is binding at EU level, but there are no fixed targets for individual Member States; an indicative target at EU level of at least a 27% improvement in energy efficiency in 2030 compared with projections of future energy consumption (based on the European Commissions 2007 Energy Baseline Scenario (EC, 2008)), which is equivalent to a reduction of primary energy consumption by about 20% compared with 2005 levels. For final energy consumption, the 2030 target would be equivalent to a 12% decrease from 2005 levels. This target will be reviewed in 2016, with an EU level of 30% in mind.  Progress towards these 2030 targets is not as evident as it is for 2020 targets:  According to Member States projections, a reduction of EU GHG emissions of between 26% (on the basis of existing mitigation measures) and 29% (accounting for planned national measures) could be achieved by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. These projected reductions fall short of the 40% target for 2030. In the sectors covered by the Effort Sharing legislation (i.e. not under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)), the projected reductions for 2030, estimated to be between 16% and 19% compared with 2005 levels, would also fall short of the necessary 30% reduction in these sectors. Maintaining the current pace of RES deployment across Europe would enable the EU to achieve RES consumption above the target of 27% of final energy consumption in 2030. However, this may not happen without additional efforts, because a number of regulatory changes have already affected investors confidence in renewables, and market barriers and fragmentation still represent challenges for new entrants. From 2020 onwards, the average reductions in both primary and final energy consumption necessary to reach the 2030 targets are slightly lower than those needed between 2005 and 2020 to meet the 2020 energy consumption target. Achieving the 2030 targets nevertheless requires not only the stringent implementation of energy efficiency measures, but also a rapid change in consumer behaviour.  Even if the 2030 EU targets are met, efforts would still need to be further enhanced in view of the EUs energy and decarbonisation objectives for 2050. After 2030, GHG emissions would need to decline at a much faster pace than anticipated today in order to reach the 2050 long-term goal, and renewable energy would need to grow even faster before 2050 in order to attain the minimum levels consistent with the EUs long-term decarbonisation objectives.  1.3 Towards more integrated governance of climate and energy policies in the European Union The EUs 2030 climate and energy policy framework contributes to achieving the objectives of the EUs Energy Union Framework Strategy (EC, 2015b), which was adopted in 2015. The strategy aims to ensure that Europe moves towards an integrated, secure, affordable and climate-compatible energy system, and achieves its climate and energy goals for 2030. It is structured around five closely related and mutually reinforcing dimensions:  supply security; internal energy market integration; energy efficiency; decarbonisation; research and innovation.  Progress towards these objectives is monitored annually through the European Commissions State of the Energy Union (EC, 2015a). On 30 November 2016, the European Commission also tables a legislative proposal on a new governance under the Energy Union in order to adapt planning, reporting and monitoring requirements to the new 2030 climate and energy framework (under EU legislation and the Paris Agreement[2]). It will specifically aim to streamline the existing planning, reporting and monitoring obligations of Member States and to minimise administrative burden. This streamlining effort is expected to ensure the availability of integrated and coherent national data and information on GHG emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency. This includes projections, as well as anticipated and realised effects of policies and measures. Such information will, in turn, improve the robustness of the assessment of progress towards the climate and energy targets presented in this report.  1.4 Progress of Member States towards national 2020 climate and energy objectives Not all Member States are performing well individually with respect to their national targets (see Table 1.1). However, the projected overachievements of the majority of Member States offset the slower progress projected in a few Member States. The Member States progress is summarised below:  In 2014, all of the Member States, with the exception of Malta, met their annual GHG emission targets set under the ESD[3]. Proxy estimates indicate that a similar situation also occurred in 2015. A total of 23 Member States project that they will meet their national GHG targets in 2020 with the current set of policies and measures in place. The other five Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg) will have to implement additional measures to reach targets domestically or use the flexibility mechanisms provided under the ESD. These mechanisms allow Member States to transfer annual emission allowances over time and between Member States. Further details of this are provided in Chapter 3. A total of 22 Member States were making good progress towards their national renewable energy targets in 2014, but France, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal were behind the trajectories they had set in their national action plans. Furthermore, the Netherlands were also behind their indicative trajectory set in the RED. The situation is expected to have changed in 2015, with only 19 Member States remaining on track, according to proxy estimates by the EEA. Further details of this are discussed in Chapter 5. All but three (Estonia, Malta and Sweden) Member States were making good progress towards indicative national targets on primary energy consumption in 2014. However, as primary consumption increased across Europe in 2015, according to EEA proxy estimates, four countries were expected to fall behind their energy efficiency targets in 2015. Further details are provided in Chapter 7.  In total, 16 Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom) were on track in 2014 to meet all three of their national climate and energy targets for 2020 (see Table 1.1). Ten of these countries need to limit only their GHG emissions or energy consumption, compared with 2005, to achieve their 2020 targets[4]. However, based on approximated estimates, not all of these 16 Member States remained on track in all three domains in 2015. As opposed to previous years, in which no Member State underperformed in all three domains, Malta was found to be in a difficult situation in 2014, as it failed to keep its GHG emissions below its ESD target and has fallen behind trajectories for achieving its 2020 targets on renewable energy and energy consumption. Strong links exist between energy efficiency improvements, the deployment of renewable energy and reductions in GHG emissions. However, not all of the GHG emission savings resulting from better energy efficiency and more renewable energy use contribute to Member States progress towards their national targets since these relate to only sectors which are not covered under the EU ETS. For example, most GHG savings resulting from the growth in the use of renewable energy take place in the power sector, which is covered under the EU ETS (EEA, 2016e). The link between the GHG emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency targets is therefore stronger at EU level, for which all emissions are considered in the 20% reduction target, than at Member State level, for which national targets do not cover ETS emissions. Renewable and energy efficiency policies nevertheless contribute to reducing emissions in the sectors covered by the ESD, particularly the transport and building sectors. Energy efficiency improvements and the development of RESs have played roles of varying importance from one Member State to another with regard to making progress towards national ESD targets (EEA, 2015).

"quality-of-europes-water-for  Quality of Europe’s water for people’s use has improved, but challenges remain to keep it clean and healthy  The quality of drinking water and bathing water, and the effectiveness of waste water treatment across the European Union continues to improve, according to a new European Environment Agency (EEA) report published today. However, pollution from sources like waste water treatment plants, agricultural runoff and storm water overflows, and emerging risks like micro pollutants from personal care products pose challenges to maintaining clean and healthy water for people’s use.   The EEA report ‘ European water policies and human health ,’ provides a combined review of three key legislative acts that underpin water management in the EU — the Bathing Water Directive, the Drinking Water Directive and the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, which contribute to achieving the over-arching objectives set by the Water Framework Directive. EU water legislation makes a significant contribution towards ensuring public health and environmental protection across Europe.   The EU legislation sets binding standards for Member States to ensure high water quality for drinking and for recreational purposes, and to limit pollution caused by waste water discharged to the environment. Member States must report key parameters of water quality and management measures under these rules. These include ensuring that all significant discharges of sewage from homes and industry undergo collection and treatment, defining water quality suitable for bathing waters and setting requirements for the quality of drinking water to protect human health.   Better water management showing positive results   The EU’s water policies on bathing water, drinking water and urban waste water have been effectively applied across the 15 older EU Member States while Member States that joined after 2004 are making steady progress on reaching the objectives.       Bathing water quality across the EU   continues to be high. The percentage of bathing water sites meeting the minimum water quality standards (of at least sufficient quality) increased to 96.1 % in 2015.    Testing and analyses between 2011-2013 show achievement rates of over 98.5% in meeting EU standards on clean drinking water.   Wastewater treatment in all parts of Europe has improved during the last 15-20 years, with a growing proportion of the population connected to waste water treatment facilities and with the waste water being treated to more demanding standards. Achievement rates in the EU-15 are in general very high, while, though improving, in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe the proportion of population connected to wastewater treatment is still relatively low compared to Central and Northern Europe.

"assessment  Habitats of European interest   Progress towards the 2020 target of improving the conservation status of habitats covered by the EU Habitats Directive has not been substantial since 2010. This indicates that significant conservation efforts need to be implemented to revert current trends.   At the EU level, only 16 % of the assessments of habitats protected under the Habitats Directive have a favourable conservation status.   Bogs, mires and fens have the highest proportion of unfavourable assessments, followed closely by grasslands.   Conservation status   trends are quite variable across biogeographic regions, however, more habitats are stable than decreasing in the terrestrial regions. There are still significant gaps in knowledge on marine habitat types.   At the EU Member State level, the majority of assessments indicate a low number of habitats with a favourable conservation status.   target 1 birds directive eu 2020 biodiversity strategy habitats directive biodiversity indicators art. 17 of the habitats directive habitat directive article 17       SEBI SEBI005 005,Target 1 of the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy addresses nature conservation objectives through proper implementation of the nature directives. The target aims at improving the conservation status of habitats covered by the Habitats Directive, so that, by 2020, 34 % of habitat assessments are favourable or improving. Currently (Figure 1), only 21 % of habitat assessments meet the target conditions: over 16 % are favourable and over 4 % have improved.  ,Across the EU-27, only 16 % of habitat assessments are favourable and 77 % indicate unfavourable conservation status (Figure 2). In terms of the unfavourable conservation status trends, only 4 % of assessments indicate an improving status and 33 % are stable. However, the status of a further 30 % is still declining (Figure 3). Looking at the conservation status trends by habitat group (based on Annex I of the Habitats Directive), bogs, mires and fens have the highest proportion of unfavourable assessments. Almost half of these habitats are deteriorating, followed closely by grasslands (40 %). Forests and freshwater habitats are also predominantly unfavourable but stable (Figure 4). In the majority of biogeographic regions, more habitats are stable than declining, with the exception of the Boreal region, where almost half the habitats are unfavourable and declining. Despite the high proportion of habitats with an unfavourable status in the Atlantic region, this is also where the greatest proportion of habitat types is improving (11 %). For marine regions, there is a significant share of improving unfavourable habitats in the Marine Atlantic region (43 %), followed by the Marine Macaronesian region with almost 17 %. By contrast, the share of declining habitat assessments in the Marine Baltic region exceeds 70 %, followed by the Marine Black Sea with 43 %. However, these results may also be attributable to the very low number of assessments available for marine regions (Figure 5). At the Member States level, the majority of assessments indicate a low number of habitats in a favourable condition, with some exceptions: Cyprus, Romania, Estonia, Malta and Slovenia reported more than 40 % of favourable habitat assessments. Northern European countries report the most habitat assessments with unfavourable status (Belgium, the United Kingdom, Denmark and the Netherlands) (Figure 6). Member States have also reported trends in the conservation status within the reporting period (2006-2012). Overall, there are more declining than improving habitat assessments. However, almost all Member States reported some unfavourable habitat assessments that are improving, ranging from less than 1 % (Italy) to almost 31 % (United Kingdom). No improvements were reported from Romania, Malta, Lithuania and Bulgaria (Figure 7)."
"assessment  Species of European interest   The 2020 target of improving the conservation status of species covered by the Habitats Directive seems to have been met. This apparent progress, however, is largely attributable to improved data and changes in methodology.   Similarly, there has been little progress towards the target for bird populations under the Birds Directive. This indicates that significant conservation efforts need to be implemented to revert current trends.    At the EU level, 23 % of the assessments of species protected under the Habitats Directive indicate a favourable conservation status. At the same time, 60 % of species assessments are unfavourable. There are still significant gaps in knowledge, especially for marine species.   Fish, molluscs and amphibians have a particularly high proportion of species that exhibit a deteriorating trend.   The conservation status of species varies considerably from one biogeographic region to another. At Member State level, more unfavourable assessments are showing a decline than those that are improving.    In the EU, over half of the bird species listed in the Birds Directive are considered to be secure, i.e. they show no foreseeable risk of extinction, decline or depletion. On the other hand, 17 % of the species listed are still threatened and another 15 % are declining or depleted.   target 1 art. 12 of the birds directive non-bird species assessments conservation status eu 2020 biodiversity strategy conservation of species habitats directive, birds directive population trends of birds art. 17 of the habitats directive habitat directive article 17 species           SEBI SEBI003 CSI CSI007 003 007,Overall, just 23 % of the assessments indicate a favourable status. A total of 60 % of assessments reveal an unfavourable conservation status, while 18 % have an unfavourable-bad status. More than one-sixth (17 %) of species assessments have an unknown status (Figure 2). Looking at the trends of the species assessments with an unfavourable conservation status, 20 % are stable and only 4 % are improving, while 22 % of the assessments are declining and 14 % are without a known trend (Figure 3). Considering to the trends in conservation status by taxonomic group of the species assessed as unfavourable, fish, molluscs and amphibians appear to have a particularly high proportion of species with a deteriorating trend. On the other hand, only 12 % of assessments for mammals with an unfavourable assessment show a deteriorating trend, while 6 % are unfavourable but improving (Figure 4). Analysis of the trends in conservation status of unfavourably assessed species according to biogeographic region shows that for terrestrial species, a significant number of species are declining in the Black Sea and Continental regions, while those in the Pannonian region are predominantly stable. In the marine regions, there is not enough data to determine any clear trend (Figure 5). At the EU Member State level, in almost half of the countries about 30 % of species assessments are favourable, and in four Member States (Ireland, Bulgaria, Estonia and Cyprus) the figure rises to 50 %. The number of unfavourable-bad species assessments exceeds 30 % in six countries: the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Luxembourg, Austria and the Czech Republic (Figure 6). Analysis of the trends in conservation status ofunfavourably assessed species, as reported by Member States, indicates that, overall, more unfavourable assessments exhibit a declining trend than an improving one. Almost all countries (except Romania) show that some of their unfavourable assessments are improving (Figure 7).,Target 1 of the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy addresses nature conservation objectives through proper implementation of the nature directives. The target aims to improve the conservation status of species covered by the Habitats Directive, so that by 2020, 25 % of species assessments are favourable or improving. Currently, 28 % of species assessments meet the target conditions (see Figure 1). This progress, however, is mainly due to changes resulting from better data or changes in methodology. For example, many species assessed as unknown in the previous reporting cycle (2000-2006) are now favourable. To take this into account, a more accurate baseline for the 2020 target should be set at 34.5 % (Figure 1).  For bird species listed in the Birds Directive, the target is for 78 % of bird species to be secure or improving by 2020. Currently, secure assessments constitute 52 % of all assessments and less than 9 % of non-secure assessments are improving. This means that a further 17 % of species need to become secure or be improving by 2020 in order to meet the target.,In total, EU population status assessments were made for 447 bird species. Results of the assessment indicate that the status of around half of all wild bird species assessed (52 %) is secure, while 17 % are still threatened and a further 15 % are near threatened, declining or depleted (Figure 8). At the EU level, short-term breeding population trends indicate that 30 % of breeding birds are decreasing, 28 % are increasing, 21 % are stable, 2 % are fluctuating and 19 % are unknown or uncertain (Figure 9).  For wintering bird taxa, only 5 % of the short-term trends are uncertain or unknown, while 46 % are increasing, 27 % are decreasing, 4 % are stable and 18 % are fluctuating (Figure 9). The short-term trends of breeding birds in Member States indicate a high degree of change in their populations. There is no clear geographic pattern discernible in these trends (Figure 10). For wintering bird populations, assessments show an increasing trend for a relatively high proportion of wintering populations (Figure 10)."
"stronger-measures-needed  Stronger measures needed to tackle harm from air pollution  Air pollution has significant impacts on the health of Europeans, particularly in urban areas, according to a new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA). While air quality is slowly improving, air pollution remains the single largest environmental health hazard in Europe, resulting in a lower quality of life due to illnesses and an estimated 467 000 premature deaths per year.     The EEA report ‘    Air quality in Europe — 2016 report    ’     presents an updated overview and analysis of air quality in Europe from 2000 to 2014 based on  data from official monitoring stations across Europe , and including more than 400 cities. It shows that in 2014 around 85 % of the urban population in the EU were exposed to fine particulate matter (  PM   2.5   ) at levels deemed harmful to health by the World Health Organization (WHO). Particulate matter can cause or aggravate cardiovascular diseases, asthma and lung cancer.         The report also provides new estimates  (1)   of the health impacts of the most harmful air pollutants based on 2013 data. Exposure to PM   2.5    was responsible for about 467 000      premature deaths       in     41 European countries  in 2013  . Within the European Union, premature deaths exceeded 430 000. The estimated impacts of nitrogen dioxide (NO   2   ) and ground-level ozone (O   3   ) exposure were around 71 000 and 17 000 premature deaths respectively in Europe.       “Emission reductions have led to improvements in air quality in Europe, but not enough to avoid unacceptable damage to human health and the environment,” said EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx. “We need to tackle the root causes of air pollution, which calls for a fundamental and innovative transformation of our mobility, energy and food systems. This process of change requires action from us all, including public authorities, businesses, citizens and research community.”      Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, welcomed the report and added: “     Today's  EEA report on air quality reminds us that we need to keep this subject high on the political agenda. The European Commission is doing so, and is committed to securing improvements in air quality. One way we can do that is to help different levels of government work better together. If a lot of air quality blackspots are in towns and cities then it is clear that local and regional governments play a central role in finding solutions. This week I hope that the European Parliament will vote positively on our reduction commitments in the new National Emission Ceilings Directive. This will provide direction for national and local actors.'         The report highlights that air quality has however improved over the years. The annual average PM   10    has fallen in 75 % of monitored locations during the period 2000–2014. Similarly, PM   2.5    concentrations, on average, have decreased between 2006 and 2014 for all station types (urban, traffic, background sites, etc.). Exposure to PM levels above WHO recommendations have also       decreased     over the years.        Other key findings      In 2014, 16 % of the EU-28 urban population was exposed to PM  10   levels above the EU daily limit value whereas 8 % was exposed to PM  2.5   levels above the EU target value. However, when compared to the stricter WHO Air Quality Guideline values set to protect human health, approximately 50 % and 85 % of city dwellers were exposed to PM  10   and PM  2.5   concentrations exceeding the WHO’s recommendations.   NO  2   affects the respiratory system directly, but also contributes to the formation of PM and O  3  . In 2014, 7 % of the urban population in the EU-28 were exposed to NO  2   concentrations above the identical WHO and EU standards, with 94 % of all exceedances occurring due to traffic.   PM 2.5  emissions from coal and biomass combustion in households and from commercial and institutional buildings have not decreased to any significant degree. To lower emissions from these sectors, it is essential to fully implement measures, such as recent changes to the Eco-design Directive for household stoves, the Medium Combustion Plant Directive, and to provide public guidance on good household burning practices, etc.   Emissions of ammonia (NH 3 ) from agriculture remain high and contribute especially to sustained PM levels and a number of high-PM episodes in Europe.   Air pollution continues to damage vegetation and ecosystems. In this context, the most harmful air pollutants are O 3 , NH 3  and NO x .       Revision of the National Emission Ceilings Directive     Following the political agreement reached with the Council in June of this year, the European Parliament formally votes this week on the revised National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive.     Member States are subsequently also expected to confirm their agreement of the revised directive before the end of 2016. The legislative proposal will establish new national emission reduction commitments applicable from 2020 and 2030 for SO   2   , NO   x   , NMVOC, NH   3   , and PM   2.5    which will help Member States in their efforts to improve air quality    .          (1) A number of variables, including population density and exposure, total mortality figures and demographic changes such as ageing are taken into account when calculating these estimates.

"less-household-waste-going-to  Less household waste going to landfill in Europe  European countries are improving their methods to prevent household trash and other municipal waste from ending up in landfill sites. Recycling rates, in particular, have increased considerably across Europe over the past decade, due in part to European environmental policies, according to a new European Environment Agency (EEA) assessment published today.    The EEA briefing, ‘ Municipal waste management across European countries ,’ compiles the latest data available on the EEA’s member countries’ waste management practices (including the 28 EU Member States, plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey, with some information on Western Balkan countries).   The rate of municipal waste going to landfills in the 32 EEA member countries fell from 49 % in 2004 to 34 % in 2014. Overall, the rates of landfilling decreased in 27 out of 32 countries. In Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, virtually no municipal waste was sent to landfill sites. Total municipal waste generation in the 32 EEA member countries declined by 3 %  and average generation per person dropped by 7% from 2004-2014. However, the analysis found that there has not been a uniform trend across countries. There has been an increase in municipal waste generation per person in 16 countries and a decrease in 19 others.   Recycling facts   One of the success stories of European environmental policies is the increase in the rate of municipal waste recycling (which covers material recycling, composting and digestion of bio-wastes). EEA countries achieved an average total recycling rate of 33 % in 2014, compared with 23 % in 2004. (For EU Member States: 37 % to 44 % over the same 2004-2014 period). Germany, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden recycled at least half of their municipal waste,  statistics show . Overall, in 15 out of 32 countries, the increase in recycling rates was at least 10 percentage points over the 2004-2014 period. Increased recycling rates and declining rates of landfilling are clearly linked, the analysis says. Usually, landfilling declines much faster than the growth in recycling, as waste management strategies mostly move from landfill towards a combination of recycling and incineration. In some cases these strategies also include pre-treatment such as mechanical-biological treatment, the outputs of which are then recycled, incinerated or landfilled.   Future progress   Despite progress in living up to European legislation on waste management, the outlook for reaching the EU’s 50 % recycling target for municipal waste by 2020 is mixed and many countries will have to step up their efforts, according to the best data available.   It is important to note however, that the data used in this assessment do not necessarily show progress against the target for all countries. Member States can choose between four different  methods  to monitor their progress, and the data uses the same method for all countries. In addition, data on waste and indicators is limited in some cases. Countries have different definitions of what constitutes municipal waste or the make-up of recycled material. For example, some countries include only waste from households, while others include similar wastes from commercial activities and offices. Improvements in waste data and further harmonisation of national reporting methods would help the effectiveness of policy measures.   Municipal waste only accounts for around 10 % of total waste generated in the EU, but it remains a visible problem. Preventing it reduces the associated environmental pressures and recycling would help turn waste turns it into a valuable source of material for the economy. The European Commission last year  proposed new targets  for municipal waste – a target for recycling 65 % of municipal waste by 2030 and a target to reduce landfill to a maximum of 10 % of municipal waste by 2030. These proposals are part of the  Commission’s circular economy package  which aim to maintain the value of products, materials and resources in the economy for as long as possible.       waste management household waste recycling rate municipal waste generation waste management targets burning waste,The EEA briefing, ‘Municipal waste management across European countries,’ compiles the latest data available on the EEA’s member countries’ waste management practices (including the 28 EU Member States, plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey, with some information on Western Balkan countries).

EEA countries achieved an average total recycling rate of 33 % in 2014, compared with 23 % in 2004. (For EU Member States: 37 % to 44 % over the same 2004-2014 period). Germany, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden recycled at least half of their municipal waste, statistics show. Overall, in 15 out of 32 countries, the increase in recycling rates was at least 10 percentage points over the 2004-2014 period. Increased recycling rates and declining rates of landfilling are clearly linked, the analysis says. Usually, landfilling declines much faster than the growth in recycling, as waste management strategies mostly move from landfill towards a combination of recycling and incineration. In some cases these strategies also include pre-treatment such as mechanical-biological treatment, the outputs of which are then recycled, incinerated or landfilled. Future progress Despite progress in living up to European legislation on waste management, the outlook for reaching the EU’s 50 % recycling target for municipal waste by 2020 is mixed and many countries will have to step up their efforts, according to the best data available. It is important to note however, that the data used in this assessment do not necessarily show progress against the target for all countries. Member States can choose between four different methods to monitor their progress, and the data uses the same method for all countries. In addition, data on waste and indicators is limited in some cases. Countries have different definitions of what constitutes municipal waste or the make-up of recycled material. For example, some countries include only waste from households, while others include similar wastes from commercial activities and offices. Improvements in waste data and further harmonisation of national reporting methods would help the effectiveness of policy measures. Municipal waste only accounts for around 10 % of total waste generated in the EU, but it remains a visible problem. Preventing it reduces the associated environmental pressures and recycling would help turn waste turns it into a valuable source of material for the economy. The European Commission last year proposed new targets for municipal waste – a target for recycling 65 % of municipal waste by 2030 and a target to reduce landfill to a maximum of 10 % of municipal waste by 2030. These proposals are part of the Commission’s circular economy package which aim to maintain the value of products, materials and resources in the economy for as long as possible.  "
"municipal-waste-management-across-european-countries  Municipal waste management across European countries  municipal waste   1. Introduction   Over the last two decades, European countries have increasingly shifted their focus with regard to municipal waste from disposal methods to prevention and recycling. Moving municipal waste management up the waste hierarchy [ 1 ]  is essential to extract more value from resources while reducing the pressures on the environment and creating jobs.   Although municipal waste represents only around 10% of total waste generated in the EU (Eurostat, 2016a and 2016b), it is very visible, and prevention of this waste has the potential to reduce its environmental impact not only during the consumption and the waste phases but also throughout the whole life cycle of the products consumed. Countries that have developed efficient municipal waste management systems generally perform better in overall waste management (EC, 2015).   This briefing is a synthesis of the outcomes of a country-by-country analysis that addressed 32 EEA countries: EU-28 Member States, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey (ETC/WMGE, 2016), complemented with some information from the Western Balkan countries.     About the data used for the assessment   The comparability of available country data and indicators is limited in some cases. There are differences in municipal waste definitions, reported waste types and data processing. For example, some countries include only waste from households, whereas others include similar wastes from commercial activities and offices.   Some countries have changed their definition of municipal waste over time, and recycled amounts can also be calculated differently, depending on whether they include the weight of materials collected but discarded during the recycling process. However, the data used in this assessment are currently the best available.        2. EU policies and targets     Waste policies and targets set at the EU level include minimum requirements for managing certain waste types. The most relevant targets for municipal waste are the Landfill Directives (EC, 1999) landfill diversion targets for biodegradable municipal waste; the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directives (EC, 1994) recycling targets; and the Waste Framework Directives (EC, 2008) target on recycling and preparing for reuse (more precisely, the target applies to specific types of household and similar waste). Countries can choose between four different methods to monitor their progress towards the last target (EC, 2011). In this briefing, the calculation of recycling rates follows the most demanding method, i.e. the recycling rate is defined as material from municipal waste recycled divided by municipal waste generated.   In 2015, the European Commission proposed new targets for municipal waste of 60% recycling and preparing for reuse by 2025 and 65% by 2030. These are based on only one calculation method  roughly the one used in this briefing  with the option of time derogations for some countries (EC, 2015). In addition, new targets to reduce municipal waste disposed of in landfill and revised targets for packaging waste have been proposed.   3. Progress   Total municipal waste generation in the EEA countries declined by 3% in absolute terms and average generation per person by 7% from 2004 to 2014. However, there has been no uniform trend across countries, with an increase in municipal waste generation per person in 16 and a decrease in 19 countries (Figure 3.1).      Figure 3.1 Municipal waste generated per person in 35 European countries (2004 and 2014)             Note: 2005 data used instead of 2004 for Poland owing to changes in methodology. Also because of data availability, instead of 2004 data, 2008 data were used for Bosnia and Herzegovina, 2006 data for Serbia, and 2008 data for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. On account of missing 2014 data, 2013 data were used for Ireland and Greece. The 2014 data for Cyprus, Germany, Luxembourg, Poland, Spain and Turkey are estimates.        In 2014, municipal waste generation per person was highest in Denmark and Switzerland and lowest in Romania, Poland and Serbia. This reflects the fact that wealthier countries tend to generate more municipal waste per person, while tourism contributes to high generation rates in Cyprus and Malta. However, caution is necessary when interpreting the data, because of the different definitions of municipal waste and varying data collection methods.   One of the success stories of environmental policy in Europe is the increase in the rates of municipal waste recycling (covering material recycling, composting and digestion of bio-wastes). EEA countries achieved an average total recycling rate of 33% in 2014, compared with 23% in 2004 (EU-27: 31% to 44% over the same time period) (Eurostat, 2016a).     Figure 3.2 Municipal waste recycling in 34 European countries (2004 and 2014)           Note: The recycling rate is calculated as the percentage of municipal waste generated that is recycled and composted. Changes in reporting methodology mean that 2014 data are not fully comparable with 2004 data for Austria, Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia and Spain. 2005 data were used instead of 2004 data for Poland because of changes in methodology. On account of data availability, instead of 2004 data, 2003 data were used for Iceland, 2007 data for Croatia, and 2006 data for Serbia; and instead of 2014 data, 2013 data were used for Greece and Ireland, and 2012 data for Turkey. Data for Cyprus, Germany, Luxembourg, Poland and Spain are estimates.    The data suggest large differences in performance among countries (Figure 3.2):     Germany, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden recycled at least half of their municipal waste in 2014.   The highest increase in recycling rates between 2004 and 2014 was reported in Lithuania, Poland, Italy, the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic (increase of 2029 percentage points).   Overall, in 15 out of 32 countries, the increase in recycling rates was at least 10 percentage points over this period.   However, in seven countries, the proportion of recycled municipal waste barely changed and in two countries it even decreased slightly.     Increasing recycling rates and declining rates of landfilling are clearly linked. Usually, landfilling declines much faster than the growth in recycling, as waste management strategies mostly move from landfill towards a combination of recycling and incineration, and in some cases also mechanicalbiological treatment (EEA, 2013).   The rate of municipal waste landfilling for the 32 EEA member countries fell from 49% in 2004 to 34% in 2014. The performance of individual countries varied. In Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, virtually no municipal waste is sent to landfill. On the other hand Cyprus, Croatia, Greece, Latvia, Malta and Turkey still landfill more than three quarters of their municipal waste.   Overall, the rates of landfilling decreased in 27 out of 32 countries. Between 2004 and 2014, the largest decreases occurred in Estonia (57 percentage points), Finland (41 percentage points), Slovenia (41 percentage points) and the United Kingdom (41 percentage points).   The amount of municipal waste landfilled and incinerated in 2014 ranged from 102kg/person in Slovenia to 480kg/person in Malta, with an average of 270kg/person in Europe (32 European countries).   Overview of policy instruments   Countries use a variety of policy instruments for diverting waste from landfill and moving towards more recycling. Table 3.1 gives an overview of such instruments for the period from 2001 to 2015. More details and additional policy instruments and strategies can be found in the EEAs  country profiles on municipal waste management , the  country profiles on resource efficiency , and the  recent EEA report on waste prevention policies . The same policy instrument can be designed and implemented in many different ways, thereby influencing its effectiveness. Table 3.1 therefore lists the policies used, but also reflects how the instruments are implemented. For example, both the absolute landfill tax level in 2015 (or the latest available year) and the increase in landfill tax are used as criteria, as the latter shows a dynamic use of the instrument. While the list of instruments is not exhaustive, some messages emerge:     Countries using many of the instruments listed in the table have a higher municipal waste recycling rate than countries using few or no instruments. However, the way in which policy instruments are combined may be more relevant than the total number of instruments.   Most countries have developed more than two national waste management plans over the period but their recycling performance differs greatly. There is no systematic difference in performance between countries with national plans and countries with only regional plans.   Many countries use pay-as-you-throw schemes (i.e. fees based on the weight or volume of the waste as an economic incentive for households to recycle their waste). Their level of implementation varies greatly by country and within countries. However, all countries with recycling rates above 45% employ a similar system of sorts, while most countries with recycling rates below 20% do not use them, indicating that pay-as-you-throw schemes are an effective instrument that drives recycling up.   All the countries that show landfill rates well below the EU-28 average of 28% have either banned landfill of biodegradable or mixed municipal waste, or implemented a ban combined with a landfill tax of at least EUR30/tonne.     Although not analysed here, other factors can be expected to contribute to high recycling rates, such as the level of wealth (there is a correlation factor of 0.65 between gross domestic product per person and the recycling rate), environmental awareness in the country, waste management tariffs and stringent implementation of waste management legislation. All countries with recycling rates below 30% (with one exception) entered the EU in 2004 or later, indicating that these countries started to implement recycling policies later.        Table 3.1 Municipal solid waste (MSW) management and selected policy instruments in European countries, 20012015             (See full table)          4. Prospects   The outlook for reaching the 50% recycling target for municipal waste by 2020 is mixed. This level of recycling has already been achieved by six countries according to the most demanding calculation method. However, several countries will have to step up their efforts in order to reach the target, particularly the five countries that currently recycle less than one fifth of generated municipal waste.   Improvements in waste data and harmonisation of national reporting methodologies are required, as uncertainties relating to the comparability of national data are a barrier to assessment of progress and the effectiveness of policy measures. The legislative proposal to amend the Waste Framework Directive, which also includes a review of targets for municipal and packaging waste and revision of definitions and calculation methods (EC, 2015), will assist in this regard.,1.

"eu-firmly-on-course-to  EU firmly on course to reach 2020 target, despite a slight increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2015  Preliminary estimates show that emissions across the European Union in 2015 were 22 % lower than 1990 levels, despite a slight increase compared to 2014, according to new reports from the European Environment Agency (EEA) published today. The reports confirm that the EU is well on course to meet its greenhouse gas emission target set for 2020.   The two EEA reports,  Trends and Projections in Europe 2016: Tracking progress towards Europe climate and energy targets , and  Approximated EU greenhouse gas inventory: Proxy GHG emission estimates for 2015  provide updated assessments of the progress of the European Union and European countries towards their climate change mitigation targets. The Trends and Projections report will be developed further with an assessment of the progress made on energy targets, expected to be published soon.   The EUs 2020 targets include reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to 1990 levels. The EEA reports show that EU emissions in both 2014 and 2015 were reduced by more than 20 % compared to 1990 levels.   Preliminary greenhouse emission estimates indicate a 0.7% increase expected for 2015. This follows an exceptional 4.0% reduction the previous year, which was due to a particularly warm winter. Emissions from industries in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) continued to decrease in 2015. On the other hand, emissions not included in the ETS increased. In particular, transport emissions increased for the second year in a row.    This years report shows that despite the small increase in emissions in 2015, the EU remains fully on track toward its 2020 climate targets. This progress forms a strong basis for implementing the Paris Agreement, which has just come into force. Nevertheless, achieving the more ambitious longer-term goals for 2030 and 2050 will require more sweeping changes and a transition to a low-carbon economy, said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director.   Progress of Member States on 2020 climate objectives   The latest national projections available from EU Member States indicate that by 2020, EU greenhouse gas emissions will remain well below the 2020 target. Progress of individual Member States toward their individual targets is more nuanced, however. These targets cover emissions from sectors which are not included in the EU ETS. In 2014, all Member States, except Malta, met their annual targets. Estimates indicate a similar situation occurred in 2015.   A total of 23 Member States project that their greenhouse gas emissions will be below their national targets in 2020 with the current set of policies and measures in place. The five remaining Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg) will have to implement additional measures to reach their targets. Member States can also use flexibility mechanisms which allow them to transfer emission credits from one year to another or between Member States.   EU progress towards 2030 climate targets   While projections from EU Member States show further decreases in EU greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2020, the pace of these reductions will slow down. Updated projections show that planned reductions will only bring EU emissions between 26 % and 29 % below 1990 levels by 2030. This falls short of the EUs 40 % reduction target for 2030. However, the agreed reform of the EU Emissions Trading System and recent policy proposals being discussed in the EU have not yet been taken into account in projections. These proposals include new annual binding greenhouse gas emission targets for Member States from 2021-2030, integration of the land use and forestry sector into the 2030 policy framework, and a European strategy to cut emissions from the transport sector. Additional proposals to address energy efficiency and to further develop renewable energy are also expected.         air pollutant emissions emissions trading scheme co2 emissions proxy greenhouse gas emissions climate and energy targets emissions trends and projections,The two EEA reports, Trends and Projections in Europe 2016: Tracking progress towards Europe climate and energy targets, and Approximated EU greenhouse gas inventory: Proxy GHG emission estimates for 2015 provide updated assessments of the progress of the European Union and European countries towards their climate change mitigation targets.

"background-information-domestic-climate-and  Background information - Domestic climate and energy targets in the EU  This section presents in detail the main climate and energy objectives which the EU and its Member States are committed to achieve by 2020, 2030 and 2050.  emissions trends and projections     1. The '20-20-20' targets for 2020   The European Union (EU) has a long-term goal of reducing Europes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 80% by 2050, compared with 1990 levels. In the context of its commitments and the negotiations at international level, in March 2007 the European Council committed the EU to becoming a highly energy-efficient, low-carbon economy by achieving three domestic climate and energy objectives by 2020 (European Council, 2007):     to reduce GHG emissions by 20% compared with 1990 levels;   to increase to 20% the proportion of renewable energy sources (RES) in the EUs gross final energy consumption;   to improve the EUs energy efficiency by 20%.     To achieve these domestic commitments, in 2009, the EU adopted the climate and energy package, which comprises various pieces of legislation(EU, 2009a, 2009b, 2009c, 2009d, 2009e and 2009f). The package introduced a clear approach to achieving the 20% reduction in total GHG emissions, compared with 1990 levels, which is equivalent to a 14% reduction compared with 2005 levels. This 14% reduction objective is to be achieved through a 21% reduction compared with 2005 levels for emissions covered by the Emissions Trading System (ETS), and a 9% reduction for sectors covered by the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) (EU, 2009b).   A revision of the ETS Directive (EU, 2009a) introduced a single 2020 target for all EU emissions covered by the EUETS (as well as ETS emissions from the three participating non-Member States, namely Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). The ETS essentially covers emissions from large industrial installations, as well as emissions from aviation. ETS emissions represent about 40 to 45% of total EU GHG emissions. The 2020 cap corresponds to a reduction of about 21% in ETS emissions by 2020, compared with 2005 levels. The sectors covered under the EUETS are therefore expected to contribute the largest proportion of emission reductions in the context of meeting the EUs 2020 GHG emissions target. For allowances allocated to the EUETS sectors, annual caps have been set for the period from 2013 to 2020; these decrease by 1.74% annually. For further details on the EUETS in the 20132020 period, see EEA, 2016.   For all other emissions not covered by the EUETS, the ESD has set annual binding targets for each year of the period between 2013 and 2020, for each Member State.   These EU-internal rules under the 2020 climate and energy package underpin the EU implementation of the 2020 target under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (see section A1.3).         2. The 2030 climate and energy framework   To ensure that the EU is cost-effectively attaining its long-term objective, EU leaders agreed, in October 2014, on a 2030 climate and energy policy framework for the EU, and endorsed the following targets (European Council, 2014):     A binding target of at least a 40% domestic reduction in GHG emissions, compared with 1990 levels, was agreed. The 40% domestic reduction target for GHG emissions will ensure that the EU is on track to cost-effectively meet its objective of cutting emissions by at least 80% by 2050. This target will be delivered collectively, with a 43% reduction in the ETS sectors and a 30% reduction in the non-ETS sectors by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. In the EUETS, the annual factor that reduces the cap on the maximum permitted emissions will be changed from 1.74% to 2.2% from 2021 onwards. In non-ETS sectors, the methodology for setting the national reduction targets, with all the elements as applied in the ESD for 2020, will be slightly amended for 2030. Efforts will be distributed on the basis of relative gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, but targets for Member States with a GDP per capita above the EU average will be adjusted relatively, in order to reflect cost-effectiveness in a fair and balanced manner. All Member States will contribute to the overall EU reduction in 2030, with the targets ranging from 0to 40%, compared with 2005 levels.   A target for renewable energy consumption of at least 27% of total energy consumption was set. This target is binding at EU level, but with no fixed targets for individual Member States. This target is intended to provide flexibility for Member States to set their own more ambitious national objectives for increased renewable energy use, and to support them, in line with the state aid guidelines, as well as take into account their degree of integration in the internal energy market.   An indicative target was set at EU level of at least 27% for improving energy efficiency, compared with projections of future energy consumption, based on the current criteria (i.e. projections of energy consumption in 2030 from the 2007 Energy Baseline scenario from the European Commission). The target will be reviewed in 2016, having in mind an EU level of 30%.     Neither the renewable energy target nor the energy efficiency target will be translated into nationally binding targets. Individual Member States are free to set their own higher national targets.   These targets for 2030 were submitted to the UNFCCC on 6 March2015 as an intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) for the Paris agreement of December 2015.   The European Commission proposed in 2016 to integrate the LULUCF sector into the EU 2030 Climate and Energy Framework from 2021 onwards. The proposal includes also modified accounting rules.   The adoption of the Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy (EC, 2015a) underlined the importance of meeting the 2030 targets as the priority Energy Union and Climate was identified as one of 10 priorities at the start of the Juncker Commissions term. This priority comprises five dimensions (i.e. supply security, a fully integrated internal energy market, energy efficiency, climate action  emission reduction and research and innovation), which are all now reported on annually in the State of the Energy Union (EC, 2015b). The annual reporting of progress is considered essential so that issues can be identified in a timely fashion and addressed, if necessary, through further policy interventions.      3. National targets and compliance under the Effort Sharing Decision   Targets for 2020   The ESD covers emissions from all sources outside the EUETS, except for emissions from aviation [ 1 ] and international maritime transport, and net emissions from LULUCF. The ESD therefore includes a range of diffuse sources in a wide range of sectors such as transport (cars, trucks), buildings (in particular heating), services, small industrial installations, agriculture and waste. Such sources currently account for almost 60% of total GHG emissions in the EU.   The ESD sets individual annual binding targets for GHG emissions not covered by the EUETS for all Member States for the period from 2013 to 2020 (annual emission allocations (AEAs)) (EU, 2009b). In 2013, the European Commission determined the AEAs of Member States for the period from 2013 to 2020, using reviewed and verified emission data for the years 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2010 (EC, 2013a). The AEAs were later adjusted to reflect the change in ETS scope from 2013 onwards (EC, 2013b) [2].   Each Member State will contribute to this effort, according to its relative wealth in terms of GDP per capita. The national emission targets range from a 20% reduction for the richest Member States to a 20% increase for the poorest ones by 2020, compared with 2005 levels (see Figure A2.0.1). At EU level, this will deliver an approximately 9 to 10% reduction in emissions by 2020, compared with 2005 levels, from those sectors covered by the decision. The least wealthy countries are allowed to increase emissions in these sectors because their relatively higher economic growth is likely to be accompanied by higher emissions. Nevertheless, their targets still represent a limit on emissions, and a reduction effort will be required by all Member States; they will need to introduce policies and measures to limit or lower their emissions in the various ESD sectors.   Proposed 2030 targets   On 20 July 2016, the European Commission presented a legislative proposal, the Effort Sharing Regulation, which sets out binding annual GHG emission targets for Member States for the period 20212030 (EC, 2016a). The proposal is the follow-up to the ESD, which established national emission targets for Member States in the non-ETS sectors between 2013 and 2020. The proposal recognises the different capacities of Member States to take action by differentiating targets according to GDP per capita across Member States. This ensures fairness because Member States with the highest incomes take on more ambitious targets than Member States with lower incomes. EU leaders recognised that an approach for high-income Member States based solely on relative GDP per capita would mean that, for some, the costs associated with reaching their targets would be relatively high. To address this, these targets have been adjusted to reflect cost-effectiveness for Member States with an above average GDP per capita. In line with the guidance of the European Council, the resulting 2030 GHG emission targets range from 0 to 40%, compared with 2005 levels (see Figure A2.0.1).   Allowed flexibilities under the ESD   The ESD allows Member States to use flexibility provisions in order to meet their annual targets, with certain limitations:     Within the Member State itself, any overachievement in a year during the period from 2013 to 2019 can be carried over to subsequent years, up to 2020. Up to 5% of a Member States annual emission allocation period may be carried forward from the following year during the period from 2013 to 2019. Where the emissions of a Member State are below that annual emission allocation, excess emission reductions can be carried over to the subsequent years.   Member States may transfer up to 5% of their AEAs to other Member States, which may use this emission allocation until 2020 (ex ante). Any overachievement in a year during the 2013 to 2019 period may also be transferred to other Member States, which may use this emission allocation until 2020 (ex post).     Member States may use emission credits from the Kyoto Protocols flexible mechanisms according to the following provisions:     The use of project-based emission credits is capped on a yearly basis up to 3% of 2005 ESD emissions in each Member State.   Member States that do not use their 3% limit for project-based credits in any specific year can transfer their unused credits for that year to other Member States, or bank it for their own use until 2020.   Member States fulfilling additional criteria (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden) may use credits from projects in the least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS) for up to an additional 1% of their verified emissions in 2005. These credits are not bankable or transferable.     Overall, a maximum of Kyoto emission credits equivalent to 750MtCO 2  at EU level can be used during the 2013 to 2020 period. As most Member States are expected to meet their ESD targets (see section 3.4) without the flexibility provisions, while other Member States can meet their ESD targets through intra-EU transfers of AEAs, the use of project credits is expected to be significantly smaller.   Any Member State exceeding its annual AEA, even after taking into account the flexibility provisions and the use of Kyoto emission credits, will have to take corrective measures as laid down in the ESD and will be subject to the following consequences:     a deduction from the AEA for the next year of the excess non-ETS emissions multiplied by 1.08 (8% interest rate);   the development of a corrective action plan  the European Commission may issue an opinion, possibly taking into account comments from the Climate Change Committee;   the transfer of emission allocations and project-based credits from the account of that Member State will be temporarily suspended while the Member State is in a state of non-compliance with its ESD obligations.     The proposed Effort Sharing Regulation for 2030 non-ETS targets maintains existing flexibilities under the current ESD (e.g. banking, borrowing, buying and selling) and provides two new flexibilities to allow for a fair and cost-efficient achievement of the targets. These new flexibilities are as follows:     A new one-off flexibility to access allowances from the EU ETS. This allows eligible Member States to achieve their national targets by covering some emissions in the non-ETS sectors with EU ETS allowances that would normally have been auctioned. EU wide, this cannot be more than 100million tonnes CO 2  over the 20212030 period. Eligible Member States have to notify the Commission before 2020 of the amount of this flexibility that they will use over the period. Since the transfer is strictly limited in volume, and decided beforehand, predictability and environmental integrity are maintained.   A new flexibility to access credits from the land-use sector. In order to stimulate additional action in the land-use sector, the proposal allows Member States to use up to 280million credits over the entire 20212030 period from certain land-use categories, in order to comply with their national targets. All Member States are eligible to make use of this flexibility, but more access is available for Member States with a larger proportion of emissions from agriculture. In line with EU leaders guidance, this recognises that there is a relatively low mitigation potential for emissions from the agriculture sector.        Figure 1. National 2020 targets under the Effort Sharing Decision and proposed targets for 2030               Note: The targets are expressed relative to 2005 ESD base-year emissions. These base-year emissions calculated on the basis of relative and absolute 2020 targets (for details on ESD base-year emissions, please see section A3.4).     The absolute 2020 and 2013 targets used for the calculations are consistent with the global warming values in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) (IPCC, 2007) and take into account the change in the scope of the ETS from the second to the third period (2013 to 2020).     Source: EU, 2009b; EC, 2016a.       4. Renewable energy targets for 2020   In order to meet its target of increasing the use of RES to 20% of gross final energy consumption by 2020, the EU adopted the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) (EC, 2009c) as part of the climate and energy package.   The RED includes legally binding national renewable energy targets for 2020, consistent with an EU-wide target of increasing RES use to 20% of gross final energy consumption by 2020, and to 10% of transport-related fuel consumption by the same year (EC, 2009b). The RED also sets an indicative trajectory for each Member State for the 2011 to 2018 period, intended to ensure that each Member State achieves its 2020 targets. An interim indicative RED target for the EU can be derived from the minimum indicative trajectories of the Member States in the run-up to 2020 (RED, Annex I, PartB).   Under the RED, Member States had to submit national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs) in 2010 (EEA, 2011). These plans outline the pathways (i.e. the expected trajectories) that Member States anticipate using to reach their legally binding national renewable energy targets by 2020. In 2011 (and every 2 years thereafter), Member States had to report on national progress towards the interim RED and expected NREAP targets. The NREAPs adopted by Member States in 2010 outline the expected trajectories for RES use, as a proportion of gross final energy consumption, towards the legally binding national 2020 RES targets.   In contrast, no national targets for renewable energy have been set for 2030 (see Section 1.2).      Figure 2 National renewable energy targets for 2020           Note: The targets for Iceland and Norway, which are not EU Member States, were agreed and included in the annex of the European Economic Area agreement. For the sake of simplicity, the report refers to these as RED targets.   Source: EC, 2009c.      5. Energy efficiency targets for 2020   In 2007, the European Council (European heads of state or government) stressed the need to increase energy efficiency in order to achieve the 20% energy savings target for 2020, for primary energy consumption, and agreed on binding targets for GHG emission reductions and renewable energy (Council of the European Union, 2007). The reduction of primary energy consumption by 20% by 2020 is a non-binding objective in the EU.   The climate and energy package does not address the energy efficiency target directly, although the CO 2  performance standards for cars and vans (EU, 2009d and 2014a), the revised EUETS Directive and the ESD all contribute to fostering energy efficiency. Since the adoption of the package, the EU energy efficiency policy framework has advanced in line with the priorities identified in the Action Plan for Energy Efficiency 2006 (EC, 2006). The energy efficiency action plan was reviewed in 2011, after revisions of the following pieces of legislation:     the Ecodesign Directive (EU, 2009g);   the Energy Labelling Directive (EU, 2010a);   the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) (EU, 2010b).     One of the key developments in the energy efficiency policy framework was the adoption of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) in 2012 (EU, 2012). The EED establishes a common framework of measures for the promotion of energy efficiency within the EU and aims to help remove barriers and overcome market failures that impede efficiency in the supply and use of energy. The EED stipulates that primary energy consumption in the EU should not exceed 1483million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2020, and that final energy consumption in the EU should not exceed 1086Mtoe in 2020. These absolute targets were set using the European Commissions 2007 Energy Baseline scenario (EC, 2011), based on the Price-driven and Agent-based Simulation of Markets Energy System Models (PRIMES). Implementing the EED was expected to lead to a 15% reduction in primary energy consumption compared with the 2007 Energy Baseline scenario, with an additional 2% reduction expected from the transport sector (Groenenberg, 2012).   Under the EED, Member States had to set indicative national targets and implement a set of mandatory requirements, one of the most significant being the establishment of an Energy Efficiency Obligation (EEO) scheme, or the implementation of alternative measures.   Member States have adopted different base years against which the progress towards national energy efficiency targets will be measured. Member States also chose different approaches for setting national targets. A total of 10 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malta and Poland) chose to focus their targets on primary energy consumption, while 12 (Croatia, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Slovakia, Slovenia and the United Kingdom) chose to focus their national targets on gross final energy consumption. Another two (Bulgaria and Sweden) have focused on primary energy intensity. Each national target reflects the specific situation of the Member State that adopted it. As a consequence, ambition levels vary greatly. Compared with 2005 levels, 16 Member States have aimed to reduce final as well as primary energy consumption; for six Member States, targets show an increase in final as well as primary energy consumption (including Malta, which has a 24% reduction target in primary energy consumption, alongside a +40% target for final energy consumption, compared with 2005). Five other Member States have placed a cap on the potential increase in either primary or final energy consumption over the period.   In some Member States, the targets may still be subject to change in the upcoming years. This is because some countries are currently holding nationwide debates on the future of their energy systems. Depending on the outcome of these debates, energy efficiency targets might be modified. A total of 12 Member States (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) revised their energy efficiency targets in their triennial national energy efficiency action plans (NEEAPs) submitted under the EED.   Figure A2.0.3 shows the national targets set by each Member State under the EED, compared with 2005 levels, for primary and final energy consumption. The year 2005 is used here to serve as a common reference, although the EED does not explicitly use it as a common base year.   In contrast, no national targets for energy efficiency have been set for 2030 (see Section 1.2).   Figure 3 National indicative energy efficiency targets for 2020, expressed in primary or final energy consumption            Note:  The national targets for 2020 reported by Member States under the EED were first calculated in absolute terms, and then compared with 2005 levels.

Overview of 2020 national climate and energy targets   The main targets that apply to Member States under international and EU commitments are presented in Table 1. The scope of existing EU legislation that implements a domestic 20% target commitment is different from that of the Kyoto target for the second commitment period. For this reason, the total allowed emissions or the emissions budget under the climate and energy package cannot be directly compared with the corresponding quantified emission limitation or reduction commitment (QELRC). Some of the main differences between the climate and energy package and the second commitment period, in terms of emissions included and the methodologies used to determine emissions, relate to the treatment of emissions from international aviation, emissions and removals from LULUCF, the use of units from flexible mechanisms, the coverage of nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3 ), flexibilities regarding base years and the use of global warming potential (GWP). The differences are summarised in Table 2. For details, please see EEA, 2014, as well as Section A1.3.

The '20-20-20' targets for 2020 The European Union (EU) has a long-term goal of reducing Europes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 80% by 2050, compared with 1990 levels. In the context of its commitments and the negotiations at international level, in March 2007 the European Council committed the EU to becoming a highly energy-efficient, low-carbon economy by achieving three domestic climate and energy objectives by 2020 (European Council, 2007):  to reduce GHG emissions by 20% compared with 1990 levels; to increase to 20% the proportion of renewable energy sources (RES) in the EUs gross final energy consumption; to improve the EUs energy efficiency by 20%.  To achieve these domestic commitments, in 2009, the EU adopted the climate and energy package, which comprises various pieces of legislation(EU, 2009a, 2009b, 2009c, 2009d, 2009e and 2009f). The package introduced a clear approach to achieving the 20% reduction in total GHG emissions, compared with 1990 levels, which is equivalent to a 14% reduction compared with 2005 levels. This 14% reduction objective is to be achieved through a 21% reduction compared with 2005 levels for emissions covered by the Emissions Trading System (ETS), and a 9% reduction for sectors covered by the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) (EU, 2009b). A revision of the ETS Directive (EU, 2009a) introduced a single 2020 target for all EU emissions covered by the EUETS (as well as ETS emissions from the three participating non-Member States, namely Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). The ETS essentially covers emissions from large industrial installations, as well as emissions from aviation. ETS emissions represent about 40 to 45% of total EU GHG emissions. The 2020 cap corresponds to a reduction of about 21% in ETS emissions by 2020, compared with 2005 levels. The sectors covered under the EUETS are therefore expected to contribute the largest proportion of emission reductions in the context of meeting the EUs 2020 GHG emissions target. For allowances allocated to the EUETS sectors, annual caps have been set for the period from 2013 to 2020; these decrease by 1.74% annually. For further details on the EUETS in the 20132020 period, see EEA, 2016. For all other emissions not covered by the EUETS, the ESD has set annual binding targets for each year of the period between 2013 and 2020, for each Member State. These EU-internal rules under the 2020 climate and energy package underpin the EU implementation of the 2020 target under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (see section A1.3).   2. The 2030 climate and energy framework To ensure that the EU is cost-effectively attaining its long-term objective, EU leaders agreed, in October 2014, on a 2030 climate and energy policy framework for the EU, and endorsed the following targets (European Council, 2014):  A binding target of at least a 40% domestic reduction in GHG emissions, compared with 1990 levels, was agreed. The 40% domestic reduction target for GHG emissions will ensure that the EU is on track to cost-effectively meet its objective of cutting emissions by at least 80% by 2050. This target will be delivered collectively, with a 43% reduction in the ETS sectors and a 30% reduction in the non-ETS sectors by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. In the EUETS, the annual factor that reduces the cap on the maximum permitted emissions will be changed from 1.74% to 2.2% from 2021 onwards. In non-ETS sectors, the methodology for setting the national reduction targets, with all the elements as applied in the ESD for 2020, will be slightly amended for 2030. Efforts will be distributed on the basis of relative gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, but targets for Member States with a GDP per capita above the EU average will be adjusted relatively, in order to reflect cost-effectiveness in a fair and balanced manner. All Member States will contribute to the overall EU reduction in 2030, with the targets ranging from 0to 40%, compared with 2005 levels. A target for renewable energy consumption of at least 27% of total energy consumption was set. This target is binding at EU level, but with no fixed targets for individual Member States. This target is intended to provide flexibility for Member States to set their own more ambitious national objectives for increased renewable energy use, and to support them, in line with the state aid guidelines, as well as take into account their degree of integration in the internal energy market. An indicative target was set at EU level of at least 27% for improving energy efficiency, compared with projections of future energy consumption, based on the current criteria (i.e. projections of energy consumption in 2030 from the 2007 Energy Baseline scenario from the European Commission). The target will be reviewed in 2016, having in mind an EU level of 30%.  Neither the renewable energy target nor the energy efficiency target will be translated into nationally binding targets. Individual Member States are free to set their own higher national targets. These targets for 2030 were submitted to the UNFCCC on 6 March2015 as an intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) for the Paris agreement of December 2015. The European Commission proposed in 2016 to integrate the LULUCF sector into the EU 2030 Climate and Energy Framework from 2021 onwards. The proposal includes also modified accounting rules. The adoption of the Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy (EC, 2015a) underlined the importance of meeting the 2030 targets as the priority Energy Union and Climate was identified as one of 10 priorities at the start of the Juncker Commissions term. This priority comprises five dimensions (i.e. supply security, a fully integrated internal energy market, energy efficiency, climate action  emission reduction and research and innovation), which are all now reported on annually in the State of the Energy Union (EC, 2015b). The annual reporting of progress is considered essential so that issues can be identified in a timely fashion and addressed, if necessary, through further policy interventions.  3. National targets and compliance under the Effort Sharing Decision Targets for 2020 The ESD covers emissions from all sources outside the EUETS, except for emissions from aviation[1]and international maritime transport, and net emissions from LULUCF. The ESD therefore includes a range of diffuse sources in a wide range of sectors such as transport (cars, trucks), buildings (in particular heating), services, small industrial installations, agriculture and waste. Such sources currently account for almost 60% of total GHG emissions in the EU. The ESD sets individual annual binding targets for GHG emissions not covered by the EUETS for all Member States for the period from 2013 to 2020 (annual emission allocations (AEAs)) (EU, 2009b). In 2013, the European Commission determined the AEAs of Member States for the period from 2013 to 2020, using reviewed and verified emission data for the years 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2010 (EC, 2013a). The AEAs were later adjusted to reflect the change in ETS scope from 2013 onwards (EC, 2013b) [2]. Each Member State will contribute to this effort, according to its relative wealth in terms of GDP per capita. The national emission targets range from a 20% reduction for the richest Member States to a 20% increase for the poorest ones by 2020, compared with 2005 levels (see Figure A2.0.1). At EU level, this will deliver an approximately 9 to 10% reduction in emissions by 2020, compared with 2005 levels, from those sectors covered by the decision. The least wealthy countries are allowed to increase emissions in these sectors because their relatively higher economic growth is likely to be accompanied by higher emissions. Nevertheless, their targets still represent a limit on emissions, and a reduction effort will be required by all Member States; they will need to introduce policies and measures to limit or lower their emissions in the various ESD sectors. Proposed 2030 targets On 20 July 2016, the European Commission presented a legislative proposal, the Effort Sharing Regulation, which sets out binding annual GHG emission targets for Member States for the period 20212030 (EC, 2016a). The proposal is the follow-up to the ESD, which established national emission targets for Member States in the non-ETS sectors between 2013 and 2020. The proposal recognises the different capacities of Member States to take action by differentiating targets according to GDP per capita across Member States. This ensures fairness because Member States with the highest incomes take on more ambitious targets than Member States with lower incomes. EU leaders recognised that an approach for high-income Member States based solely on relative GDP per capita would mean that, for some, the costs associated with reaching their targets would be relatively high. To address this, these targets have been adjusted to reflect cost-effectiveness for Member States with an above average GDP per capita. In line with the guidance of the European Council, the resulting 2030 GHG emission targets range from 0 to 40%, compared with 2005 levels (see Figure A2.0.1). Allowed flexibilities under the ESD The ESD allows Member States to use flexibility provisions in order to meet their annual targets, with certain limitations:  Within the Member State itself, any overachievement in a year during the period from 2013 to 2019 can be carried over to subsequent years, up to 2020. Up to 5% of a Member States annual emission allocation period may be carried forward from the following year during the period from 2013 to 2019. Where the emissions of a Member State are below that annual emission allocation, excess emission reductions can be carried over to the subsequent years. Member States may transfer up to 5% of their AEAs to other Member States, which may use this emission allocation until 2020 (ex ante). Any overachievement in a year during the 2013 to 2019 period may also be transferred to other Member States, which may use this emission allocation until 2020 (ex post).  Member States may use emission credits from the Kyoto Protocols flexible mechanisms according to the following provisions:  The use of project-based emission credits is capped on a yearly basis up to 3% of 2005 ESD emissions in each Member State. Member States that do not use their 3% limit for project-based credits in any specific year can transfer their unused credits for that year to other Member States, or bank it for their own use until 2020. Member States fulfilling additional criteria (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden) may use credits from projects in the least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS) for up to an additional 1% of their verified emissions in 2005. These credits are not bankable or transferable.  Overall, a maximum of Kyoto emission credits equivalent to 750MtCO2 at EU level can be used during the 2013 to 2020 period. As most Member States are expected to meet their ESD targets (see section 3.4) without the flexibility provisions, while other Member States can meet their ESD targets through intra-EU transfers of AEAs, the use of project credits is expected to be significantly smaller. Any Member State exceeding its annual AEA, even after taking into account the flexibility provisions and the use of Kyoto emission credits, will have to take corrective measures as laid down in the ESD and will be subject to the following consequences:  a deduction from the AEA for the next year of the excess non-ETS emissions multiplied by 1.08 (8% interest rate); the development of a corrective action plan  the European Commission may issue an opinion, possibly taking into account comments from the Climate Change Committee; the transfer of emission allocations and project-based credits from the account of that Member State will be temporarily suspended while the Member State is in a state of non-compliance with its ESD obligations.  The proposed Effort Sharing Regulation for 2030 non-ETS targets maintains existing flexibilities under the current ESD (e.g. banking, borrowing, buying and selling) and provides two new flexibilities to allow for a fair and cost-efficient achievement of the targets. These new flexibilities are as follows:  A new one-off flexibility to access allowances from the EU ETS. This allows eligible Member States to achieve their national targets by covering some emissions in the non-ETS sectors with EU ETS allowances that would normally have been auctioned. EU wide, this cannot be more than 100million tonnes CO2 over the 20212030 period. Eligible Member States have to notify the Commission before 2020 of the amount of this flexibility that they will use over the period. Since the transfer is strictly limited in volume, and decided beforehand, predictability and environmental integrity are maintained. A new flexibility to access credits from the land-use sector. In order to stimulate additional action in the land-use sector, the proposal allows Member States to use up to 280million credits over the entire 20212030 period from certain land-use categories, in order to comply with their national targets. All Member States are eligible to make use of this flexibility, but more access is available for Member States with a larger proportion of emissions from agriculture. In line with EU leaders guidance, this recognises that there is a relatively low mitigation potential for emissions from the agriculture sector.   Figure 1.

These base-year emissions calculated on the basis of relative and absolute 2020 targets (for details on ESD base-year emissions, please see section A3.4). The absolute 2020 and 2013 targets used for the calculations are consistent with the global warming values in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) (IPCC, 2007) and take into account the change in the scope of the ETS from the second to the third period (2013 to 2020).

Renewable energy targets for 2020 In order to meet its target of increasing the use of RES to 20% of gross final energy consumption by 2020, the EU adopted the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) (EC, 2009c) as part of the climate and energy package. The RED includes legally binding national renewable energy targets for 2020, consistent with an EU-wide target of increasing RES use to 20% of gross final energy consumption by 2020, and to 10% of transport-related fuel consumption by the same year (EC, 2009b). The RED also sets an indicative trajectory for each Member State for the 2011 to 2018 period, intended to ensure that each Member State achieves its 2020 targets. An interim indicative RED target for the EU can be derived from the minimum indicative trajectories of the Member States in the run-up to 2020 (RED, Annex I, PartB). Under the RED, Member States had to submit national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs) in 2010 (EEA, 2011). These plans outline the pathways (i.e. the expected trajectories) that Member States anticipate using to reach their legally binding national renewable energy targets by 2020. In 2011 (and every 2 years thereafter), Member States had to report on national progress towards the interim RED and expected NREAP targets. The NREAPs adopted by Member States in 2010 outline the expected trajectories for RES use, as a proportion of gross final energy consumption, towards the legally binding national 2020 RES targets. In contrast, no national targets for renewable energy have been set for 2030 (see Section 1.2).  Figure 2 National renewable energy targets for 2020   Note: The targets for Iceland and Norway, which are not EU Member States, were agreed and included in the annex of the European Economic Area agreement. For the sake of simplicity, the report refers to these as RED targets. Source: EC, 2009c.  5. Energy efficiency targets for 2020 In 2007, the European Council (European heads of state or government) stressed the need to increase energy efficiency in order to achieve the 20% energy savings target for 2020, for primary energy consumption, and agreed on binding targets for GHG emission reductions and renewable energy (Council of the European Union, 2007). The reduction of primary energy consumption by 20% by 2020 is a non-binding objective in the EU. The climate and energy package does not address the energy efficiency target directly, although the CO2 performance standards for cars and vans (EU, 2009d and 2014a), the revised EUETS Directive and the ESD all contribute to fostering energy efficiency. Since the adoption of the package, the EU energy efficiency policy framework has advanced in line with the priorities identified in the Action Plan for Energy Efficiency 2006 (EC, 2006). The energy efficiency action plan was reviewed in 2011, after revisions of the following pieces of legislation:  the Ecodesign Directive (EU, 2009g); the Energy Labelling Directive (EU, 2010a); the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) (EU, 2010b).  One of the key developments in the energy efficiency policy framework was the adoption of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) in 2012 (EU, 2012). The EED establishes a common framework of measures for the promotion of energy efficiency within the EU and aims to help remove barriers and overcome market failures that impede efficiency in the supply and use of energy. The EED stipulates that primary energy consumption in the EU should not exceed 1483million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2020, and that final energy consumption in the EU should not exceed 1086Mtoe in 2020. These absolute targets were set using the European Commissions 2007 Energy Baseline scenario (EC, 2011), based on the Price-driven and Agent-based Simulation of Markets Energy System Models (PRIMES). Implementing the EED was expected to lead to a 15% reduction in primary energy consumption compared with the 2007 Energy Baseline scenario, with an additional 2% reduction expected from the transport sector (Groenenberg, 2012). Under the EED, Member States had to set indicative national targets and implement a set of mandatory requirements, one of the most significant being the establishment of an Energy Efficiency Obligation (EEO) scheme, or the implementation of alternative measures. Member States have adopted different base years against which the progress towards national energy efficiency targets will be measured. Member States also chose different approaches for setting national targets. A total of 10 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malta and Poland) chose to focus their targets on primary energy consumption, while 12 (Croatia, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Slovakia, Slovenia and the United Kingdom) chose to focus their national targets on gross final energy consumption. Another two (Bulgaria and Sweden) have focused on primary energy intensity. Each national target reflects the specific situation of the Member State that adopted it. As a consequence, ambition levels vary greatly. Compared with 2005 levels, 16 Member States have aimed to reduce final as well as primary energy consumption; for six Member States, targets show an increase in final as well as primary energy consumption (including Malta, which has a 24% reduction target in primary energy consumption, alongside a +40% target for final energy consumption, compared with 2005). Five other Member States have placed a cap on the potential increase in either primary or final energy consumption over the period. In some Member States, the targets may still be subject to change in the upcoming years. This is because some countries are currently holding nationwide debates on the future of their energy systems. Depending on the outcome of these debates, energy efficiency targets might be modified. A total of 12 Member States (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) revised their energy efficiency targets in their triennial national energy efficiency action plans (NEEAPs) submitted under the EED. Figure A2.0.3 shows the national targets set by each Member State under the EED, compared with 2005 levels, for primary and final energy consumption. The year 2005 is used here to serve as a common reference, although the EED does not explicitly use it as a common base year. In contrast, no national targets for energy efficiency have been set for 2030 (see Section 1.2).

Overview of 2020 national climate and energy targets The main targets that apply to Member States under international and EU commitments are presented in Table 1. The scope of existing EU legislation that implements a domestic 20% target commitment is different from that of the Kyoto target for the second commitment period. For this reason, the total allowed emissions or the emissions budget under the climate and energy package cannot be directly compared with the corresponding quantified emission limitation or reduction commitment (QELRC). Some of the main differences between the climate and energy package and the second commitment period, in terms of emissions included and the methodologies used to determine emissions, relate to the treatment of emissions from international aviation, emissions and removals from LULUCF, the use of units from flexible mechanisms, the coverage of nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), flexibilities regarding base years and the use of global warming potential (GWP). The differences are summarised in Table 2. For details, please see EEA, 2014, as well as Section A1.3.

"current-progress-towards-targets-under  3. Progress towards Member States' greenhouse gas emission targets  This chapter presents the current progress achieved by EU Member States towards their national annual targets on greenhouse gas emissions. These targets, set under the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD), concern emissions which are not included in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). It also presents an outlook of the projected progress towards ESD targets.   3.1 Current progress towards targets under the Effort Sharing Decision   In order to achieve the European Unions (EUs) objective of a 20% reduction in total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2020, compared with 1990, the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) (EU, 2009a) sets national targets for each Member State on GHG emissions not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) (EU, 2009b). There are no national targets on GHG emissions that cover total (economy-wide) emissions. National ESD targets cover sectors such as transport, buildings, agriculture and waste management. Altogether, these sectors account for almost 60% of total EU GHG emissions. Mitigation actions take place at national level, through a mix of EU-driven policies and measures and national initiatives. ESD targets range from 20% reductions (Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg) to 20% allowed increases (Bulgaria), compared with 2005 base-year levels. Taken together, the aggregated ESD targets for 2020 represent a 9% reduction at EU level compared with 2005 base-year levels. The ESD also sets annual binding targets for the 20132020 period, in order to monitor progress across the EU, allow for corrective action and ultimately ensure the attainment of the EUs GHG emission target by 2020.   In 2014, all but one Member State exhibited ESD emissions that were below their 2014 targets (see Figure 2.1). The largest overachievements in 2014 in absolute terms were made in Italy (41MtCO 2 -eq.), France (36MtCO 2 -eq.) and the United Kingdom (30MtCO 2 -eq.). Of the 18 Member States that achieved 2014 ESD emissions that were less than their 2005 base-year values, eight (Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden) achieved ESD emissions that were over 10% less than their targets. Despite having a target that was higher than its 2005 base-year levels, Maltas emissions remained above its 2014 ESD target (by 0.1million annual emission allocations (AEAs), which is equal to a gap of 11%).   A similar situation is expected for 2015, based on approximated estimates of ESD emissions: the same Member States as in 2014 are expected to have ESD emissions that are over 10% below their targets, while Malta is expected to remain the only Member State with ESD emissions exceeding its ESD target for that year (by 0.2million AEAs; equal to an 18% gap).    As the differences between Maltas actual emissions and its targets for 2014 and 2015 are higher than 5%, a limit up to which it is possible to borrow AEAs from the following year (60000 AEAs)  [1]  , Malta would need to use additional flexibilities, such as buying AEAs from other Member States, to comply with the ESD.

Source: EC, 2013a, 2013b and 2017; EEA, 2016a, 2016b and 2016c.          3.2 Projected progress towards targets under the Effort Sharing Decision   The latest projections reported by Member States show that there are diverse expectations with regard to ESD emission trends for the 2015 to 2020 period. For many Member States, projections are consistent with past trends and suggest continuous decreases in ESD emissions between 2013 and 2020. However, projections do not account for the unusually large decrease that occurred in 2014 (due to particularly warm climatic conditions) and the subsequent rebound (increase in GHG emissions) observed in 2015 (see section 1.1).   The vast majority of Member States projected that their ESD emissions will remain below their annual ESD targets during the whole compliance period (from 2013 to 2020):     16 countries projected a decrease in their ESD emissions between 2015 and 2020 (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom).   10 countries projected an increase in their ESD emissions during this period (Croatia, Estonia, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Spain).   Two countries expect their emissions to decrease first and then increase (Luxembourg and Malta).     Based on the latest national projections (i.e. those submitted in 2015 or updated in 2016) for the 2016-2020 period, 23 Member States expect that their ESD emissions will stay below their annual targets under the ESD in every year from 2016 to 2020 [2] , on the basis of the with existing measures (WEM) scenario (see Figure 2.2). These Member States include Finland which, with a projected shortfall of only 0.04 percentage points, which is well within the margin of uncertainty, is considered to be able to reach its 2020 target with current measures in place.   Conversely, for five Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg), national projections suggest that emissions could exceed AEAs (i.e. annual ESD targets) for one or several years between 2016 and 2020 (see Table A3.3 in Annex 3). These five Member States all have 2020 targets under the ESD ranging from 15% to 20% reductions, compared with 2005 base-year levels. Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg are the three Member States that have a 20% reduction target for 2020 under the ESD.   Maltas projections indicate that the annual ESD targets for the 20162020 period will all be achieved, despite the fact that, according to recent data, ESD emissions exceeded annual ESD targets in 2013, 2014 and 2015.   Figure 3.2 Projected progress of Member States towards their 2020 ESD targets          Click on the image for interactive data visualisation     Note: Only 18 Member States submitted a with additional measures (WAM) scenario. For the other Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovenia and Sweden), the WEM scenario is shown instead.     Source: EC, 2013a and 2013b; EEA, 2016d.       3.3 Cumulated gaps for 2013-2020 and use of the flexibilities provided under the Effort Sharing Decision   ESD emission targets, expressed in quantities of AEAs, can be considered as annual emission budgets that can be partly transferred from one year to another, as well as between Member States under certain rules defined in the ESD. It is therefore possible to define an overall emission budget under the ESD for the whole 20132020 period for each Member State and at EU level. As historic and projected ESD emissions at EU level are below ESD targets, an overall surplus of between 1600 and 1760million AEAs is expected by 2020 at EU level (see section A1.4 in Annex 1).   At Member State level, the size of the expected cumulated AEA surpluses or deficits by 2020 differ greatly (see Figure 2.3). The largest cumulated surpluses are projected for Italy, France and Spain. Only one Member State (Ireland) expects a deficit of AEAs in 2020 if no additional measures are implemented in due time or if no additional flexibilities (other than transfers of surplus AEAs from one year to the following year) are used.   Figure 3.3 Projected cumulated gaps with regard to ESD targets, 20132020          Click on the image for interactive data visualisation       Note: A positive value represents a surplus of AEAs. A negative value represents a shortfall of AEAs.     Only 18 Member States submitted a with additional measures (WAM) scenario. For the other Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovenia and Sweden), the WEM scenario is shown instead.     Source: EC, 2013a, 2013b, 2016 and 2017; EEA, 2016a, 2016b, 2016c and 2016d.       Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg, for which national projections suggest that ESD emissions will exceed ESD targets by 2020, can still meet their obligations under the ESD by enhancing national efforts to reduce their domestic emissions to levels below ESD target levels by 2020, as well as by using flexibility provisions provided for under the ESD (see Table A3.4), as described below:     For Austria, deficits of AEAs are projected for each year between 2016 and 2020 in the WEM scenario, while the with additional measures (WAM) scenario suggests that there will be no deficit. Austria could therefore close its annual gaps by implementing the additional measures currently at planning stage, in particular in the transport sector (e.g. efficiency improvements of vehicles, modal shift to public or non-motorised transport, charging for external effects on noise or air pollution and tolls). Austria could also achieve its ESD targets by using AEAs accumulated between 2013 and 2015. According to the updated projection, this would be sufficient to close the gap in ESD targets by 2020.   For Belgium, projections indicate that deficits of AEAs could occur between 2017 and 2020 in the WEM scenario, with an estimated gap of 4.0million AEAs in 2020. No WAM scenario is available and Belgium did not report on additional measures, so no statements can be made with regard to whether or not additional measures could close the estimated gap. Belgium could achieve its ESD targets in the whole period by using surplus AEAs accumulated between 2013 and 2016.   For Denmark, projections show a small deficit (0.3million AEAs) for the year 2020 only. Denmark would thus be able to achieve its ESD targets over the whole period by using surplus AEAs accumulated in the years prior to 2020.   For Ireland, projections show deficits under both scenarios, starting from 2016 (WEM scenario) or 2017 (WAM scenario) until 2020. In the WEM scenario, transferring surplus AEAs accumulated between 2013 and 2015 would not be sufficient for Ireland to comply each year until 2020. Ireland therefore needs to successfully implement additional measures or use other flexibilities. If additional measures are implemented, ESD targets could be reached by using surplus AEAs accumulated between 2013 and 2016. As reported by Ireland, the additional measures that would contribute to closing the gap in ESD sectors include additional energy efficiency measures, a targeted realisation of 40% of electricity generation from renewables by 2020, the replacement of coal-fired electricity generation by natural gas, retrofits in the industry sector and thermal energy from renewable sources. In the transport sector, additional measures foresee increased deployment of electric vehicles, more efficient traffic movement and 10% of fuel for road transport from renewables by 2020. Additional measures are also envisaged for the buildings (commercial and residential) sector, in which retrofit schemes, increased use of renewables and building regulations could contribute towards further GHG emission savings. Despite the significant proportion of Irelands ESD emissions that are contributed by the agriculture sector, compared with other Member States, only one additional measure is planned for this sector: it is envisaged that nitrification and urease inhibitors will be used in conjunction with nitrogen fertilizers, thereby reducing gaseous losses and reducing total fertilizer nitrogen use.   For Luxembourg, deficits are projected for the years 2019 and 2020, with a gap of 0.5million AEAs in 2020. This gap could be filled with the use of surplus AEAs from preceding years. No WAM scenario is available.     Table 4.1 summarises the minimum conditions required to stay within the 20132020 ESD budget. Overall, a net surplus of between 1600 and around 1760million AEAs (depending on the scenario considered) could accumulate by 2020 if all unused AEAs are carried over to subsequent years within the compliance period from 2013 to 2020. This surplus is higher than the one calculated in the 2015 assessment (EEA, 2015) (1500 to 1700million AEAs), which results from updated projections submitted in late 2015 and in 2016 by 8 Member States (Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland and Luxembourg). The quantity of surplus AEAs would be largely sufficient to cover the potential deficits observed or expected in a limited number of Member States. So far, no use of flexible mechanisms (transfer of AEAs between Member States or additional flexibility through the purchase of emission credits outside the EU) has been reported.

There are no national targets on GHG emissions that cover total (economy-wide) emissions. National ESD targets cover sectors such as transport, buildings, agriculture and waste management. Altogether, these sectors account for almost 60% of total EU GHG emissions. Mitigation actions take place at national level, through a mix of EU-driven policies and measures and national initiatives. ESD targets range from 20% reductions (Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg) to 20% allowed increases (Bulgaria), compared with 2005 base-year levels. Taken together, the aggregated ESD targets for 2020 represent a 9% reduction at EU level compared with 2005 base-year levels. The ESD also sets annual binding targets for the 20132020 period, in order to monitor progress across the EU, allow for corrective action and ultimately ensure the attainment of the EUs GHG emission target by 2020. In 2014, all but one Member State exhibited ESD emissions that were below their 2014 targets (see Figure 2.1). The largest overachievements in 2014 in absolute terms were made in Italy (41MtCO2-eq.), France (36MtCO2-eq.) and the United Kingdom (30MtCO2-eq.). Of the 18 Member States that achieved 2014 ESD emissions that were less than their 2005 base-year values, eight (Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden) achieved ESD emissions that were over 10% less than their targets. Despite having a target that was higher than its 2005 base-year levels, Maltas emissions remained above its 2014 ESD target (by 0.1million annual emission allocations (AEAs), which is equal to a gap of 11%). A similar situation is expected for 2015, based on approximated estimates of ESD emissions: the same Member States as in 2014 are expected to have ESD emissions that are over 10% below their targets, while Malta is expected to remain the only Member State with ESD emissions exceeding its ESD target for that year (by 0.2million AEAs; equal to an 18% gap). As the differences between Maltas actual emissions and its targets for 2014 and 2015 are higher than 5%, a limit up to which it is possible to borrow AEAs from the following year (60000 AEAs)[1], Malta would need to use additional flexibilities, such as buying AEAs from other Member States, to comply with the ESD.

Two countries expect their emissions to decrease first and then increase (Luxembourg and Malta).  Based on the latest national projections (i.e. those submitted in 2015 or updated in 2016) for the 2016-2020 period, 23 Member States expect that their ESD emissions will stay below their annual targets under the ESD in every year from 2016 to 2020[2], on the basis of the with existing measures (WEM) scenario (see Figure 2.2).

These five Member States all have 2020 targets under the ESD ranging from 15% to 20% reductions, compared with 2005 base-year levels. Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg are the three Member States that have a 20% reduction target for 2020 under the ESD. Maltas projections indicate that the annual ESD targets for the 20162020 period will all be achieved, despite the fact that, according to recent data, ESD emissions exceeded annual ESD targets in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

Source: EC, 2013a and 2013b; EEA, 2016d.  3.3 Cumulated gaps for 2013-2020 and use of the flexibilities provided under the Effort Sharing Decision ESD emission targets, expressed in quantities of AEAs, can be considered as annual emission budgets that can be partly transferred from one year to another, as well as between Member States under certain rules defined in the ESD. It is therefore possible to define an overall emission budget under the ESD for the whole 20132020 period for each Member State and at EU level. As historic and projected ESD emissions at EU level are below ESD targets, an overall surplus of between 1600 and 1760million AEAs is expected by 2020 at EU level (see section A1.4 in Annex 1). At Member State level, the size of the expected cumulated AEA surpluses or deficits by 2020 differ greatly (see Figure 2.3). The largest cumulated surpluses are projected for Italy, France and Spain. Only one Member State (Ireland) expects a deficit of AEAs in 2020 if no additional measures are implemented in due time or if no additional flexibilities (other than transfers of surplus AEAs from one year to the following year) are used. Figure 3.3 Projected cumulated gaps with regard to ESD targets, 20132020  Click on the image for interactive data visualisation Note: A positive value represents a surplus of AEAs. A negative value represents a shortfall of AEAs. Only 18 Member States submitted a with additional measures (WAM) scenario. For the other Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovenia and Sweden), the WEM scenario is shown instead. Source: EC, 2013a, 2013b, 2016 and 2017; EEA, 2016a, 2016b, 2016c and 2016d.  Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg, for which national projections suggest that ESD emissions will exceed ESD targets by 2020, can still meet their obligations under the ESD by enhancing national efforts to reduce their domestic emissions to levels below ESD target levels by 2020, as well as by using flexibility provisions provided for under the ESD (see Table A3.4), as described below:  For Austria, deficits of AEAs are projected for each year between 2016 and 2020 in the WEM scenario, while the with additional measures (WAM) scenario suggests that there will be no deficit. Austria could therefore close its annual gaps by implementing the additional measures currently at planning stage, in particular in the transport sector (e.g. efficiency improvements of vehicles, modal shift to public or non-motorised transport, charging for external effects on noise or air pollution and tolls). Austria could also achieve its ESD targets by using AEAs accumulated between 2013 and 2015. According to the updated projection, this would be sufficient to close the gap in ESD targets by 2020. For Belgium, projections indicate that deficits of AEAs could occur between 2017 and 2020 in the WEM scenario, with an estimated gap of 4.0million AEAs in 2020. No WAM scenario is available and Belgium did not report on additional measures, so no statements can be made with regard to whether or not additional measures could close the estimated gap. Belgium could achieve its ESD targets in the whole period by using surplus AEAs accumulated between 2013 and 2016. For Denmark, projections show a small deficit (0.3million AEAs) for the year 2020 only. Denmark would thus be able to achieve its ESD targets over the whole period by using surplus AEAs accumulated in the years prior to 2020. For Ireland, projections show deficits under both scenarios, starting from 2016 (WEM scenario) or 2017 (WAM scenario) until 2020. In the WEM scenario, transferring surplus AEAs accumulated between 2013 and 2015 would not be sufficient for Ireland to comply each year until 2020. Ireland therefore needs to successfully implement additional measures or use other flexibilities. If additional measures are implemented, ESD targets could be reached by using surplus AEAs accumulated between 2013 and 2016. As reported by Ireland, the additional measures that would contribute to closing the gap in ESD sectors include additional energy efficiency measures, a targeted realisation of 40% of electricity generation from renewables by 2020, the replacement of coal-fired electricity generation by natural gas, retrofits in the industry sector and thermal energy from renewable sources. In the transport sector, additional measures foresee increased deployment of electric vehicles, more efficient traffic movement and 10% of fuel for road transport from renewables by 2020. Additional measures are also envisaged for the buildings (commercial and residential) sector, in which retrofit schemes, increased use of renewables and building regulations could contribute towards further GHG emission savings. Despite the significant proportion of Irelands ESD emissions that are contributed by the agriculture sector, compared with other Member States, only one additional measure is planned for this sector: it is envisaged that nitrification and urease inhibitors will be used in conjunction with nitrogen fertilizers, thereby reducing gaseous losses and reducing total fertilizer nitrogen use. For Luxembourg, deficits are projected for the years 2019 and 2020, with a gap of 0.5million AEAs in 2020. This gap could be filled with the use of surplus AEAs from preceding years. No WAM scenario is available.  Table 4.1 summarises the minimum conditions required to stay within the 20132020 ESD budget. Overall, a net surplus of between 1600 and around 1760million AEAs (depending on the scenario considered) could accumulate by 2020 if all unused AEAs are carried over to subsequent years within the compliance period from 2013 to 2020. This surplus is higher than the one calculated in the 2015 assessment (EEA, 2015) (1500 to 1700million AEAs), which results from updated projections submitted in late 2015 and in 2016 by 8 Member States (Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland and Luxembourg). The quantity of surplus AEAs would be largely sufficient to cover the potential deficits observed or expected in a limited number of Member States. So far, no use of flexible mechanisms (transfer of AEAs between Member States or additional flexibility through the purchase of emission credits outside the EU) has been reported.

"international-climate-commitments-in-europe  Background information - International climate commitments in Europe  This section presents the main climate change mitigation targets and objectives taken by the European Union and other member countries of the European Environment Agency, in particular under the United Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.   1. The UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris agreement   In 1992, countries across the globe adopted the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in order to cooperatively consider options for limiting average global temperature increases and the resulting climate change. Under the UNFCCC, developed country parties (Annex I parties) [1]  are specifically obliged to commit to adopting national policies and to take corresponding measures for the mitigation of climate change.   The Kyoto Protocol was the first international legally binding agreement signed under the UNFCCC. It specifies the mitigation obligations of the Annex I parties that signed the agreement. It was signed in 1997 and entered into force in 2005. The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ran from 2008 until 2012. In this first period, 37 industrialised countries committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by an average of 5% compared with 1990 levels.   In Doha, Qatar, in 2012 (at the 18th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 18) and the eighth meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 8)), the second commitment period (20132020) was delineated; the Doha Amendment (UNFCCC, 2012a) includes new, quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments (QELRCs) for Annex I parties intending to take part in the second commitment period. Overall, the Doha Amendment sets an emission reduction objective of 18% less than 1990 levels for all parties to the Kyoto Protocol for the second commitment period (see Table A1.1). The Doha Amendments entry into force is subject to acceptance by at least three-quarters of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol [2] . Although the EU and its 28 Member States, and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (i.e. all European Environment Agency (EEA) countries) agreed on QELRCs for the second commitment period, other countries, such as Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Russia, did not submit targets for the second commitment period (despite having targets under the first commitment period). Overall, emissions by countries with targets for the second commitment period make up only 14 to 15% of global emissions (EC, 2013).   The EU has been at the forefront of international efforts towards a global climate deal. After limited participation in the Kyoto Protocol and the lack of an agreement in Copenhagen in 2009, the EU has been building a broad coalition of developed and developing countries in favour of high ambition; this shaped the successful outcome of the Paris conference (COP 21). The Paris Agreement is a bridge between todays policies and climate neutrality before the end of the 21st century. Governments have agreed on a long-term goal of ensuring that the increase in global average temperature does not exceed 2C above pre-industrial levels, aiming to limit the increase to no more than 1.5C, as this would significantly reduce risks and the impacts of climate change.   Before and during the Paris conference, countries submitted comprehensive national climate action plans (intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs)). These are not yet sufficient to keep global warming levels below 2C, but the agreement will help towards achieving this target. The EU was the first major economy to submit its intended contribution to the new agreement in March 2015. It is already taking steps to implement its target to reduce emissions by at least 40% by 2030. The agreement opened for signature for 1 year on 22 April 2016 and will enter into force after 55 countries that account for at least 55% of global emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification.   2. Achievements of the European Union under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012)   The Kyoto Protocol was ratified by the European Union (EU) when it was constituted of 15 Member States. Under the first commitment period, the 15 EU Member States (EU-15) pledged to jointly reduce their GHG emissions by 8% compared with base-year levels (base-year levels are roughly equivalent to 1990 levels) [3] . To determine the contribution of each Member State in meeting this overall target, differentiated emission limitation or reduction targets were agreed for each of the 15, pre-2004 Member States under an EU accord known as the Burden-sharing Agreement (EC, 2006).   Although the 15 pre-2004 Member States had a joint target, 11 of the 13 countries that became EU Member States in 2004, 2007 or 2013 ratified the Kyoto Protocol separately and therefore had individual targets under the Kyoto Protocols first commitment period. The EU-28 did not have a target under the first commitment period. Cyprus and Malta did not have targets either, as they became Annex I parties to the convention (i.e. the UNFCCC) in 2013 and 2010, respectively (UNFCCC, 2009, 2011).   Of the other EEA member countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland had individual targets under the Kyoto Protocols first commitment period. Turkey, which acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in February 2009, had no quantified emission reduction commitment. Despite being an Annex I party to the UNFCCC, Turkey was not included in the Kyoto Protocols Annex B in which individual targets for Annex I parties are listed, because it was not a party to the UNFCCC when the Kyoto Protocol was adopted [4] .   The EU and its Member States have met their commitments under the Kyoto Protocols first commitment period (20082012). For the whole 20082012 period, the EUs total emissions, excluding Cyprus and Malta, which had no targets, were around 19% below the sum of base-year emissions, not including the additional reductions as a result of carbon sinks (from the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector) and international credits. The EU-15 achieved an overall reduction of 11.7% domestically, not including the additional reductions resulting from carbon sinks (from the LULUCF sector) and international credits.   3. Progress of the European Union under the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2013-2020)   For the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, the EU, its 28 Member States and Iceland agreed to a joint QELRC corresponding to a 20% reduction compared with the base year; they declared that they intended to fulfil this commitment jointly, under Article4 of the Kyoto Protocol. The three other EEA member countries, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, also agreed on QELRCs for the second commitment period.   The Council adopted, on 13 July 2015, the legislation necessary for the EU to formally ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The Council adopted two decisions:     Council decision on the ratification of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol establishing the second commitment period;   Council decision on the agreement between the EU, its Member States and Iceland, necessary for the joint fulfilment of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.     In parallel with ratification by the EU, the individual Member States and Iceland will finalise their national ratification processes; however, the second commitment period has not yet been ratified by the EU.

Methodological details related to targets under the Kyoto Protocol and the UNFCCC   First commitment period   For the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, the targets (expressed in emission budgets for the whole period) were based on the following methodological assumptions and conditions:     The gases covered are carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ), consistent with the GHGs covered by the reporting requirements under the UNFCCC;   Emissions of non-CO 2  gases are converted into CO 2 -equivalent (CO 2 -eq.) emissions using global warming potential (GWP) values included in the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (IPCC, 1996);   1990 is defined as the base year, but flexibility rules can be applied on fluorinated gases (F-gases) and for economies in transition contained in Article 3(5) of the Kyoto Protocol;   The target covers the following sectors: energy, industrial processes and product use (IPPU), agriculture and waste. Emissions or removals from LULUCF are included, while emissions from international aviation and shipping are excluded;   Certain emission credits can be used to achieve targets, under the Kyoto flexible mechanisms.     Second commitment period   The main amendments to Kyoto Protocol rules for the second commitment period (from 2013 to 2020), compared with the rules that were applicable in the first commitment period (from 2008 to 2012), are as follows:     In addition to the gases covered in the first commitment period, the target for the second commitment period also covers nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3 ).   An ambition mechanism allows a party to adjust its commitment by increasing its ambition during a commitment period.   Surplus assigned amount units (AAUs) from the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol can be carried over according to specific accounting rules (for further details, see EEA, 2014)).   The AAUs of a party for the second commitment period can be adjusted in order to prevent an increase in its emissions for the 2013 to 2020 period, beyond its average emissions for the years 2008 to 2010.   New accounting rules for emissions removals from LULUCF according to the relevant decisions made at COP 17 in Durban (UNFCCC, 2012b).   Emissions of non-CO 2  gases are converted into CO 2 -equivalent emissions using the GWP values included in the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC (IPCC, 2007).     However, a number of rules are unchanged for the second commitment period. As in the first commitment period, the target for the second commitment period refers to 1990 as a single base year, but allows for different base years according to the flexibility rules for F-gases and economies in transition (as described above). For the newly added GHG NF 3 , either 1995 or 2000 may be used as the base year. Base years for individual Member States have not yet been set for the second commitment period. The use of certified emission reductions (CERs) from the clean development mechanism, emission reduction units (ERUs) [5]  from joint implementation projects and the possible recognition of units from new market-based mechanisms are all possible in order to achieve targets (still capped under EU domestic legislation). Sector coverage remains the same.   Convention (the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change)   In 2010, the EU submitted a pledge to reduce its GHG emissions by 20% by 2020, compared with 1990 levels, in order to contribute to achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC: to stabilise GHG concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human-induced) interference with the climate system, or, in other words, to limit the global temperature increase to less than 2C above temperature levels before industrialisation. The EU clarified that the accounting rules for its target under the UNFCCC are more ambitious than the current rules under the Kyoto Protocol; for example, international aviation has been included, an annual compliance cycle for emissions under the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) has been added and there are higher quality standards for emission credits from the Kyoto Protocols clean development mechanism (CDM) used under the ETS (UNFCCC, 2013b). Accordingly, the following assumptions and conditions apply to the EUs target of a 20% reduction under the UNFCCC:     Emissions or removals from LULUCF are not included (but moving to the higher target of 30% would require some contribution from LULUCF).   The target refers to 1990 as a single base year, not allowing for different base years for F-gases or economies in transition, as under the Kyoto Protocol.   Emissions from international and domestic aviation are partly included in the target; furthermore, the target covers the IPCC sectors of energy, industrial processes and product use (IPPU), agriculture and waste.   A limited number of CERs, ERUs and units from new market-based mechanisms may be used to achieve the target: under the EUETS, the use of international credits is capped (up to 50% of the reduction required from EUETS sectors by 2020 can be achieved through the use of carbon credits). Quality standards also apply to the use of international credits in the EU ETS, including a ban on credits from LULUCF projects and certain industrial gas projects. In the ESD sectors, the annual use of international credits is limited to up to 3% of each Member States ESD emissions in 2005, with a limited number of Member States being permitted to use an additional 1% from projects in the least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS), subject to conditions. These caps thus define the concept of the supplementary use of market-based mechanisms for the fulfilment of targets, and indicate that the EU applies more ambitious rules with regard to the use of market-based mechanisms to its target under the UNFCCC than would be applied in the context of the Kyoto Protocol.   The carry-over of surplus AAUs from the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol is not possible (but surplus EU emission allowances allocated under the EUETS can be banked from the 20082012 period into subsequent periods).   The target covers the gases CO 2 , CH 4 , N 2 O, HFCs, PFCs and SF 6 , consistent with the GHGs covered under the reporting requirements under the convention (UNFCCC, 2013b).        5. Land use, land-use change and forestry activities under the Kyoto Protocol   In addition to policies and measures that target sources of GHG emissions, countries can use policies and measures to protect their existing terrestrial carbon stocks (e.g. by reducing deforestation) and further enhance terrestrial carbon stocks (e.g. by increasing the area or carbon density of forests).   The following LULUCF activities are included under the Kyoto Protocol:     Afforestation, reforestation and deforestation (ARD) since 1990 (mandatory activities covered by Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol), for land that has been subject to direct, human-induced conversion from a non-forest to a forest state, or vice versa, are included.   Forest management (FM), cropland management (CM), grazing-land management (GM) and revegetation (RV) are included. Although CM, GM and RV are voluntary, FM has been a mandatory activity since the second commitment period under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol. These activities pertain to land that has not undergone conversion since 1990, but is otherwise subject to a specific land activity. Parties account for net emissions or removals for each activity during the commitment period by issuing removal units (RMUs) [6] , in the case of net GHG removals from LULUCF activities, or by cancelling Kyoto units in the case of LULUCF activities that are a net source of GHG emissions. LULUCF activities can therefore be used to offset emissions from other sources if removals are higher than emissions from this sector. In the first commitment period, the number of RMUs that could be issued by each party under FM was capped (UNFCCC, 2006). For the second commitment period, FM activities are accounted for against an FM reference level, i.e. a country-specific level of business-as-usual emissions or removals. RMUs are issued only if FM removals are higher or emissions are lower than the agreed FM reference level. Otherwise, Kyoto units are cancelled.     RMUs can be accounted for at the end of a commitment period or annually. According to Decision 13/CMP.1, parties must indicate the frequency of accounting with their initial reports. For each activity under Article 3.3 and Article 3.4, parties have elected to account for emissions or removals either annually during the commitment period, or only once at the end of this period. The decision on frequency of accounting determines when parties can issue RMUs or cancel other units in the case of emissions from Article 3.3 and Article 3.4 activities.   For the second commitment period, new accounting rules apply for the accounting of emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector. In particular, additional activities for wetland management can be accounted for on a voluntary basis. Guidelines for these new rules were developed by the IPCC and adopted by the UNFCCC. Subsequently, the rules were almost entirely transferred into EU law in the form of EU Decision 529/2013/EU on accounting rules on greenhouse gas emissions and removals resulting from activities relating to land use, land-use change and forestry and on information concerning actions relating to those activities (EU, 2013b). This legislation harmonises EU reporting on LULUCF with Kyoto Protocol requirements, but also goes beyond these requirements. Under EU rules, Member States must also report on agricultural activities (CM and GM), irrespective of whether or not these activities are elected under the Kyoto Protocol.   LULUCF emissions and removals are not included in the EU domestic 2020 target under the climate and energy package.      6. Emissions from aviation   Although GHG emissions from domestic and international aviation have been partly included in the EUs target under the UNFCCC since 2012 as part of the EUETS, only emissions from domestic aviation are included in its targets under the Kyoto Protocol. Domestic aviation from the EU Member States amounts to less than 0.5% of total GHG emissions without LULUCF, whereas the international aviation of EU Member States totals about 3% of total emissions.   In principle, the EUETS covers all flights arriving at, and departing from, airports in all EU Member States, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein and closely related territories. However, since 2012, flights to and from aerodromes from other countries have not been included in the EUETS. This exclusion, first resulting from the stop the clock decision (EU, 2013a) was made in order to facilitate the negotiation of a global agreement on aviation emissions in autumn 2013 by the General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). At its 38th meeting in autumn 2013, the ICAO decided on a roadmap for the development of a global market-based mechanism to tackle aviation emissions. By 2016, the body will decide on a mechanism to be implemented by 2020.   The EU decided to continue with a reduced scope in the 20132016 period (EU, 2014). Only flights between aerodromes located in countries in the European Economic Area are included in this scope. Flights to and from outermost regions, as per Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), are covered if they occur only in the same outermost region.   More than 1200 aviation operators are currently included in the EUETS. The cap for aviation in the EUETS is based on average historic emissions in this sector between 2004 and 2006 (221.4MtCO 2  for all participating countries) [7] . The cap for the 20132020 period is equivalent to 95% of baseline emissions (EU, 2009). Whereas aircraft operators may use EU aviation allowances (EUAAs) as well as EU allowances (EUAs) from the stationary sectors, stationary installations are not permitted to use aviation allowances for compliance. In addition, some international credits can be used by aircraft operators: up to 14% of their verified emissions in 2012, and, from 2013 onwards, each aircraft operator is entitled to use international credits up to a maximum of 1.5% of its verified emissions during the period from 2013 to 2020, without prejudice to any residual entitlement from 2012.,1. The UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris agreement In 1992, countries across the globe adopted the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in order to cooperatively consider options for limiting average global temperature increases and the resulting climate change. Under the UNFCCC, developed country parties (Annex I parties)[1] are specifically obliged to commit to adopting national policies and to take corresponding measures for the mitigation of climate change. The Kyoto Protocol was the first international legally binding agreement signed under the UNFCCC. It specifies the mitigation obligations of the Annex I parties that signed the agreement. It was signed in 1997 and entered into force in 2005. The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ran from 2008 until 2012. In this first period, 37 industrialised countries committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by an average of 5% compared with 1990 levels. In Doha, Qatar, in 2012 (at the 18th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 18) and the eighth meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 8)), the second commitment period (20132020) was delineated; the Doha Amendment (UNFCCC, 2012a) includes new, quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments (QELRCs) for Annex I parties intending to take part in the second commitment period. Overall, the Doha Amendment sets an emission reduction objective of 18% less than 1990 levels for all parties to the Kyoto Protocol for the second commitment period (see Table A1.1). The Doha Amendments entry into force is subject to acceptance by at least three-quarters of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol[2]. Although the EU and its 28 Member States, and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (i.e. all European Environment Agency (EEA) countries) agreed on QELRCs for the second commitment period, other countries, such as Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Russia, did not submit targets for the second commitment period (despite having targets under the first commitment period). Overall, emissions by countries with targets for the second commitment period make up only 14 to 15% of global emissions (EC, 2013). The EU has been at the forefront of international efforts towards a global climate deal. After limited participation in the Kyoto Protocol and the lack of an agreement in Copenhagen in 2009, the EU has been building a broad coalition of developed and developing countries in favour of high ambition; this shaped the successful outcome of the Paris conference (COP 21). The Paris Agreement is a bridge between todays policies and climate neutrality before the end of the 21st century. Governments have agreed on a long-term goal of ensuring that the increase in global average temperature does not exceed 2C above pre-industrial levels, aiming to limit the increase to no more than 1.5C, as this would significantly reduce risks and the impacts of climate change. Before and during the Paris conference, countries submitted comprehensive national climate action plans (intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs)). These are not yet sufficient to keep global warming levels below 2C, but the agreement will help towards achieving this target. The EU was the first major economy to submit its intended contribution to the new agreement in March 2015. It is already taking steps to implement its target to reduce emissions by at least 40% by 2030. The agreement opened for signature for 1 year on 22 April 2016 and will enter into force after 55 countries that account for at least 55% of global emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification. 2. Achievements of the European Union under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012) The Kyoto Protocol was ratified by the European Union (EU) when it was constituted of 15 Member States. Under the first commitment period, the 15 EU Member States (EU-15) pledged to jointly reduce their GHG emissions by 8% compared with base-year levels (base-year levels are roughly equivalent to 1990 levels)[3]. To determine the contribution of each Member State in meeting this overall target, differentiated emission limitation or reduction targets were agreed for each of the 15, pre-2004 Member States under an EU accord known as the Burden-sharing Agreement (EC, 2006). Although the 15 pre-2004 Member States had a joint target, 11 of the 13 countries that became EU Member States in 2004, 2007 or 2013 ratified the Kyoto Protocol separately and therefore had individual targets under the Kyoto Protocols first commitment period. The EU-28 did not have a target under the first commitment period. Cyprus and Malta did not have targets either, as they became Annex I parties to the convention (i.e. the UNFCCC) in 2013 and 2010, respectively (UNFCCC, 2009, 2011). Of the other EEA member countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland had individual targets under the Kyoto Protocols first commitment period. Turkey, which acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in February 2009, had no quantified emission reduction commitment. Despite being an Annex I party to the UNFCCC, Turkey was not included in the Kyoto Protocols Annex B in which individual targets for Annex I parties are listed, because it was not a party to the UNFCCC when the Kyoto Protocol was adopted[4]. The EU and its Member States have met their commitments under the Kyoto Protocols first commitment period (20082012). For the whole 20082012 period, the EUs total emissions, excluding Cyprus and Malta, which had no targets, were around 19% below the sum of base-year emissions, not including the additional reductions as a result of carbon sinks (from the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector) and international credits. The EU-15 achieved an overall reduction of 11.7% domestically, not including the additional reductions resulting from carbon sinks (from the LULUCF sector) and international credits. 3. Progress of the European Union under the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2013-2020) For the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, the EU, its 28 Member States and Iceland agreed to a joint QELRC corresponding to a 20% reduction compared with the base year; they declared that they intended to fulfil this commitment jointly, under Article4 of the Kyoto Protocol. The three other EEA member countries, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, also agreed on QELRCs for the second commitment period. The Council adopted, on 13 July 2015, the legislation necessary for the EU to formally ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The Council adopted two decisions:  Council decision on the ratification of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol establishing the second commitment period; Council decision on the agreement between the EU, its Member States and Iceland, necessary for the joint fulfilment of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.  In parallel with ratification by the EU, the individual Member States and Iceland will finalise their national ratification processes; however, the second commitment period has not yet been ratified by the EU.

Methodological details related to targets under the Kyoto Protocol and the UNFCCC First commitment period For the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, the targets (expressed in emission budgets for the whole period) were based on the following methodological assumptions and conditions:  The gases covered are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), consistent with the GHGs covered by the reporting requirements under the UNFCCC; Emissions of non-CO2 gases are converted into CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq.) emissions using global warming potential (GWP) values included in the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (IPCC, 1996); 1990 is defined as the base year, but flexibility rules can be applied on fluorinated gases (F-gases) and for economies in transition contained in Article 3(5) of the Kyoto Protocol; The target covers the following sectors: energy, industrial processes and product use (IPPU), agriculture and waste. Emissions or removals from LULUCF are included, while emissions from international aviation and shipping are excluded; Certain emission credits can be used to achieve targets, under the Kyoto flexible mechanisms.  Second commitment period The main amendments to Kyoto Protocol rules for the second commitment period (from 2013 to 2020), compared with the rules that were applicable in the first commitment period (from 2008 to 2012), are as follows:  In addition to the gases covered in the first commitment period, the target for the second commitment period also covers nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). An ambition mechanism allows a party to adjust its commitment by increasing its ambition during a commitment period. Surplus assigned amount units (AAUs) from the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol can be carried over according to specific accounting rules (for further details, see EEA, 2014)). The AAUs of a party for the second commitment period can be adjusted in order to prevent an increase in its emissions for the 2013 to 2020 period, beyond its average emissions for the years 2008 to 2010. New accounting rules for emissions removals from LULUCF according to the relevant decisions made at COP 17 in Durban (UNFCCC, 2012b). Emissions of non-CO2 gases are converted into CO2-equivalent emissions using the GWP values included in the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC (IPCC, 2007).  However, a number of rules are unchanged for the second commitment period. As in the first commitment period, the target for the second commitment period refers to 1990 as a single base year, but allows for different base years according to the flexibility rules for F-gases and economies in transition (as described above). For the newly added GHG NF3, either 1995 or 2000 may be used as the base year. Base years for individual Member States have not yet been set for the second commitment period. The use of certified emission reductions (CERs) from the clean development mechanism, emission reduction units (ERUs)[5] from joint implementation projects and the possible recognition of units from new market-based mechanisms are all possible in order to achieve targets (still capped under EU domestic legislation). Sector coverage remains the same. Convention (the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) In 2010, the EU submitted a pledge to reduce its GHG emissions by 20% by 2020, compared with 1990 levels, in order to contribute to achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC: to stabilise GHG concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human-induced) interference with the climate system, or, in other words, to limit the global temperature increase to less than 2C above temperature levels before industrialisation. The EU clarified that the accounting rules for its target under the UNFCCC are more ambitious than the current rules under the Kyoto Protocol; for example, international aviation has been included, an annual compliance cycle for emissions under the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) has been added and there are higher quality standards for emission credits from the Kyoto Protocols clean development mechanism (CDM) used under the ETS (UNFCCC, 2013b). Accordingly, the following assumptions and conditions apply to the EUs target of a 20% reduction under the UNFCCC:  Emissions or removals from LULUCF are not included (but moving to the higher target of 30% would require some contribution from LULUCF). The target refers to 1990 as a single base year, not allowing for different base years for F-gases or economies in transition, as under the Kyoto Protocol. Emissions from international and domestic aviation are partly included in the target; furthermore, the target covers the IPCC sectors of energy, industrial processes and product use (IPPU), agriculture and waste. A limited number of CERs, ERUs and units from new market-based mechanisms may be used to achieve the target: under the EUETS, the use of international credits is capped (up to 50% of the reduction required from EUETS sectors by 2020 can be achieved through the use of carbon credits). Quality standards also apply to the use of international credits in the EU ETS, including a ban on credits from LULUCF projects and certain industrial gas projects. In the ESD sectors, the annual use of international credits is limited to up to 3% of each Member States ESD emissions in 2005, with a limited number of Member States being permitted to use an additional 1% from projects in the least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS), subject to conditions. These caps thus define the concept of the supplementary use of market-based mechanisms for the fulfilment of targets, and indicate that the EU applies more ambitious rules with regard to the use of market-based mechanisms to its target under the UNFCCC than would be applied in the context of the Kyoto Protocol. The carry-over of surplus AAUs from the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol is not possible (but surplus EU emission allowances allocated under the EUETS can be banked from the 20082012 period into subsequent periods). The target covers the gases CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6, consistent with the GHGs covered under the reporting requirements under the convention (UNFCCC, 2013b).   5. Land use, land-use change and forestry activities under the Kyoto Protocol In addition to policies and measures that target sources of GHG emissions, countries can use policies and measures to protect their existing terrestrial carbon stocks (e.g. by reducing deforestation) and further enhance terrestrial carbon stocks (e.g. by increasing the area or carbon density of forests). The following LULUCF activities are included under the Kyoto Protocol:  Afforestation, reforestation and deforestation (ARD) since 1990 (mandatory activities covered by Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol), for land that has been subject to direct, human-induced conversion from a non-forest to a forest state, or vice versa, are included. Forest management (FM), cropland management (CM), grazing-land management (GM) and revegetation (RV) are included. Although CM, GM and RV are voluntary, FM has been a mandatory activity since the second commitment period under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol. These activities pertain to land that has not undergone conversion since 1990, but is otherwise subject to a specific land activity. Parties account for net emissions or removals for each activity during the commitment period by issuing removal units (RMUs)[6], in the case of net GHG removals from LULUCF activities, or by cancelling Kyoto units in the case of LULUCF activities that are a net source of GHG emissions. LULUCF activities can therefore be used to offset emissions from other sources if removals are higher than emissions from this sector. In the first commitment period, the number of RMUs that could be issued by each party under FM was capped (UNFCCC, 2006). For the second commitment period, FM activities are accounted for against an FM reference level, i.e. a country-specific level of business-as-usual emissions or removals. RMUs are issued only if FM removals are higher or emissions are lower than the agreed FM reference level. Otherwise, Kyoto units are cancelled.  RMUs can be accounted for at the end of a commitment period or annually. According to Decision 13/CMP.1, parties must indicate the frequency of accounting with their initial reports. For each activity under Article 3.3 and Article 3.4, parties have elected to account for emissions or removals either annually during the commitment period, or only once at the end of this period. The decision on frequency of accounting determines when parties can issue RMUs or cancel other units in the case of emissions from Article 3.3 and Article 3.4 activities. For the second commitment period, new accounting rules apply for the accounting of emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector. In particular, additional activities for wetland management can be accounted for on a voluntary basis. Guidelines for these new rules were developed by the IPCC and adopted by the UNFCCC. Subsequently, the rules were almost entirely transferred into EU law in the form of EU Decision 529/2013/EU on accounting rules on greenhouse gas emissions and removals resulting from activities relating to land use, land-use change and forestry and on information concerning actions relating to those activities (EU, 2013b). This legislation harmonises EU reporting on LULUCF with Kyoto Protocol requirements, but also goes beyond these requirements. Under EU rules, Member States must also report on agricultural activities (CM and GM), irrespective of whether or not these activities are elected under the Kyoto Protocol. LULUCF emissions and removals are not included in the EU domestic 2020 target under the climate and energy package.  6. Emissions from aviation Although GHG emissions from domestic and international aviation have been partly included in the EUs target under the UNFCCC since 2012 as part of the EUETS, only emissions from domestic aviation are included in its targets under the Kyoto Protocol. Domestic aviation from the EU Member States amounts to less than 0.5% of total GHG emissions without LULUCF, whereas the international aviation of EU Member States totals about 3% of total emissions. In principle, the EUETS covers all flights arriving at, and departing from, airports in all EU Member States, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein and closely related territories. However, since 2012, flights to and from aerodromes from other countries have not been included in the EUETS. This exclusion, first resulting from the stop the clock decision (EU, 2013a) was made in order to facilitate the negotiation of a global agreement on aviation emissions in autumn 2013 by the General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). At its 38th meeting in autumn 2013, the ICAO decided on a roadmap for the development of a global market-based mechanism to tackle aviation emissions. By 2016, the body will decide on a mechanism to be implemented by 2020. The EU decided to continue with a reduced scope in the 20132016 period (EU, 2014). Only flights between aerodromes located in countries in the European Economic Area are included in this scope. Flights to and from outermost regions, as per Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), are covered if they occur only in the same outermost region. More than 1200 aviation operators are currently included in the EUETS. The cap for aviation in the EUETS is based on average historic emissions in this sector between 2004 and 2006 (221.4MtCO2 for all participating countries)[7]. The cap for the 20132020 period is equivalent to 95% of baseline emissions (EU, 2009). Whereas aircraft operators may use EU aviation allowances (EUAAs) as well as EU allowances (EUAs) from the stationary sectors, stationary installations are not permitted to use aviation allowances for compliance. In addition, some international credits can be used by aircraft operators: up to 14% of their verified emissions in 2012, and, from 2013 onwards, each aircraft operator is entitled to use international credits up to a maximum of 1.5% of its verified emissions during the period from 2013 to 2020, without prejudice to any residual entitlement from 2012."
"annex-1-progress-towards-greenhouse  Annex 1    Progress towards greenhouse gas emission targets: data and methodology  This annex provides technical details on the data and methods used by the EEA to track current and projected progress towards greenhouse gas emission targets in the EU.   emissions trends and projections   1. Reporting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions   The assessments of progress towards greenhouse gas (GHG) emission targets presented in this report are, for the most part, based on information submitted by Member States themselves under Regulation (EU) No 525/2013, the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) (EU, 2013a).   The initial purposes of the reporting requirements stipulated in the MMR are to enable the European Union (EU) to complete its reporting commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and to evaluate the projected progress of the EU and its Member States towards fulfilling their GHG mitigation commitments under the Kyoto Protocol in annual reports prepared by the European Commission and the European Environment Agency (EEA).   Implementing provisions (EU, 2014a) provide a structure and format for the reporting of GHG inventories and approximated GHG inventories, information on policies and measures, GHG projections and the use of auctioning revenue and project credits, and are used for the purposes of the LULUCF (land use, land-use change and forestry) Decision (EU, 2013b). Furthermore, a delegated act (EU, 2014b) defines the substantive requirements for an EU inventory system in order to fulfil the obligations pursuant to Decision 19/CMP.1.    2. Data sources for greenhouse gas emissions    The analysis presented in this report is based on several sets of GHG emission data.   Historic trends of greenhouse gas emissions   GHG emission data for the period from 1990 to 2014 are official data reported by the EU and Member States under the UNFCCC in their corresponding GHG inventory reports (EEA, 2016a and 2016b). The EEA is responsible for the compilation of the EU GHG inventory and, together with the European Topic Centre on Air Pollution and Climate Change Mitigation (ETC/ACM)[1], it implements a quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedure (EC, 2013a) in order to ensure the timeliness, completeness, consistency, comparability, accuracy and transparency of the projections reported by Member States and used in this report. In 2016, a comprehensive review of GHG emission data took place under article 19 of the MMR, in the context of the annual compliance cycle under the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD). This concerned the years 2005, 20082010, 2013 and 2014.   Approximated greenhouse gas emissions for 2015   Early approximated (proxy) estimates of 2015 GHG emissions were reported by Member States to the European Commission under the MMR by 31 July 2016. These estimates were aggregated to EU level by the EEA (EEA, 2016c). Bulgaria, Cyprus, Lithuania and Romania did not submit proxy GHG inventories. The missing data were gap filled by EEA and ETC/ACM for the calculation of EU totals. For Luxembourg and Malta, which submitted after the deadline, gap filled estimates were taken into account for the calculation of EU totals, but the assessment of these countries progress towards ESD targets in 2015 was based on the reported data.   Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union Emissions Trading System since 2005   Data relative to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) are used to analyse emission trends in the EUETS, but also to determine the level of emissions covered under the ESD. For the years 20052012, ETS emissions include estimates to reflect the scope of the EU ETS for the third trading period. These data are publicly available from the European Union Transaction Log (EUTL) [ 2 ] and the EEA ETS data viewer (EEA, 2016d). The data considered in the analysis were extracted from the EUTL on 13 September 2016.   Emissions covered under the Effort Sharing Decision   For the purpose of analysing emission trends in the ESD, historic 2005 ESD emissions are calculated using the latest GHG inventory data, from which ETS emissions and CO 2  emissions from domestic aviation are subtracted. ETS emissions include estimates to reflect the scope of the EU ETS for the third trading period for the years 20052012.   The ESD GHG emission data for the years 2013 and 2014 are consistent with the outcome of the 2016 comprehensive review of national GHG inventory data pursuant to Article 19(1) of the MMR, which was concluded on 30 August 2016. The data used by the Commission to determine Member Statess compliance under the ESD for 2013 and 2014 will be made publicly available (EC, 2016 and 2017).   Long-term historic trends of Emissions Trading System and Effort Sharing Decision emissions   For Figure 1.2, Figure 1.3 and Figure 1.4, GHG emissions for the years 19902015 are split into those covered by the EU ETS and those covered by the ESD. These splits are based on the application of a fixed percentage for each of the main source categories defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for the reporting of national GHG inventories:     energy sector (IPCC sectors 1.A.1, 1.B and 1.C): 90% for ETS/10% for ESD;   the manufacturing and construction sector (IPCC sector 1.A.2): 71% for ETS/29% for ESD;   the residential and commercial sectors (IPCC sectors 1.A.4 and 1.A.5): 1% for ETS/99% for ESD;   the industrial processes sector (IPCC sector 2): 60% for ETS/40% for ESD;   the transport (without aviation), agriculture and waste sectors (IPCC sectors 1.A.3, 3 and 5): 100% for ESD;   the aviation sector (IPCC sector 1A3a and memo item international bunkers): 34% for ETS.     Projections for ETS and ESD are reported by source categories. The separation of ETS GHG emissions into source categories was partly carried out by applying average sectoral percentages to total ETS GHG emissions for Poland only.   The 2005 Effort Sharing Decision base-year emissions   The 2005 ESD base-year emissions are calculated by EEA, so as to be consistent with both:     the relative 2020 ESD target (as a percentage of 2005 emissions) defined in the ESD (EU, 2009);   the absolute 2020 ESD target determined by the Commission (EC, 2013b and 2013c).     The EEA calculates 2005 ESD base-year emissions as follows:   ESD base-year emissions=2020 absolute target/(1+% of 2020 ESD target)   These calculated ESD base-year emissions can also be used to, for example, compare relative changes in ESD emissions with 2020 ESD targets expressed in percentage.   In this report, calculated 2005 ESD base-year emissions are used to express the distance between ESD emissions and ESD targets in a normalised way (see, for example, Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2). The distance, calculated as the absolute difference between emissions and targets divided by 2005 base-year emissions, is expressed in percentage points (a proportion of 2005 base-year emissions). It is then directly comparable with targets and reductions as percentages of 2005 levels and allows relevant comparisons from one Member State to another (see section A3.3).   These calculated 2005 ESD base-year emissions may differ, sometimes significantly, from actual historic 2005 emissions under the ESD based on the latest GHG inventories, ETS verified emissions and EEA estimate of emissions for 20052012 to reflect the current scope of the EUETS (see above).   Projections of greenhouse gas emissions   The report uses GHG projection data that are reported biennially by Member States under the MMR (EEA, 2016e). Mandatory reporting takes place every 2 years (2013, 2015, etc.). Member States must also report substantial changes to projections every other year (2014, 2016, etc.). Member States have submitted projections as follows:     In 2015, all Member States except Greece submitted projections.   In 2016, eight Member States (Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Ireland, Greece, Hungary and Luxembourg) as well as Norway and Switzerland provided updated projections. All updated projections have been included until 7 July 2016.     Under the MMR, Member States report projections in two scenarios:     A with existing measures (WEM) scenario, which considers the implementation of existing (already implemented) measures, can be applied.   If available, a with additional measures (WAM) scenario, which also considers the implementation of additional measures (at planning stage), can be applied. In 2015, 18 Member States reported projections on the basis of such WAM scenarios: Austria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain and the United Kingdom. For the aggregation of a WAM scenario at EU level, Member States that have not reported a WAM scenario have been gap-filled using the WEM scenario.     An overview of projected emissions for both scenarios is presented inTable 2 of the annex Background information - International climate commitments in Europe   Member States reported projections for total and sectoral GHG emissions, as well as a split of these projections between those covered by the EU ETS and those covered by the ESD, by source categories[3]. Although projections of total emissions are relevant to the assessment of the EUs progress towards its 20% reduction target by 2020, the assessment of the projected progress of Member States towards their national 2020 targets, set under the ESD as part of the climate and energy package, is based on projection data on emissions not covered by the EUETS, i.e. ESD projections.   The EEA implements a quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedure in order to ensure the timeliness, completeness, consistency, comparability, accuracy and transparency of the projections reported by Member States and used in this report. This procedure is described inElements of the Union system for policies and measures and projections and the quality assurance and control (QA/QC) programme as required under Regulation (EU) No 525/2013(EC, 2015). If significant discrepancies can be observed between the inventory value for the reference year and the projected year, an alignment of the level of projections is performed. Such calibration is performed in order to match national projections with a common reference year for aggregated EU projections, which is the year 2013. When such calibration took place in 2015, national GHG inventory data as of 30 June 2015 were used. For updated projections, calibrations were performed in 2016 against national GHG inventory data from 15 January 2016. Calibrations took place for Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Malta, the Netherlands and Portugal.

(b) Reported projections not quality checked by EEA.     Projections for emissions under the Emissions Trading System concern stationary installations only (aviation not included).     Total GHG emissions do not include emissions from international aviation or net emissions or removals from Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF).     NE: Not estimated.     Source: EEA, 2016e.       Annual emission targets (annual emission allocations) under the Effort Sharing Decision for the period from 2013 to 2020   The annual emission allocation (AEA) values for the period from 2013 to 2020 were defined in Commission Decision No 2013/162/EU (EC, 2013b) and adjusted according to Commission Implementing Decision No 2013/634/EU (EC, 2013c), in order to reflect the change in scope of the EU ETS in 2013.   3. Tracking progress towards targets under the Effort Sharing Decision   The progress of Member States towards their targets under the ESD is assessed by comparing ESD GHG emission levels with the relevant annual targets under the ESD. The assessment does not take into account the possible use of flexibility options as permitted under the ESD and is therefore not an assessment of compliance under the ESD.   The assessment of current progress towards 2014 ESD targets is based on a comparison between ESD GHG emissions and ESD targets (AEAs) for 2014:     Member States with historic emissions below their annual ESD target are considered to be currently on track towards their targets under the ESD.   By contrast, Member States with historic emissions higher than their ESD target are considered not to be currently on track towards their targets under the ESD.     The assessment of projected progress towards 2020 ESD targets is based on a comparison between projected domestic ESD GHG emissions in the WEM scenario in 2020 and ESD targets (AEAs) for 2020:     Member States with WEM projections lower than their 2020 target are projected to be on track towards their targets.   Member States with WEM projections higher than their 2020 target are not  projected to be on track towards their targets.     All the data used for this assessment (ESD GHG emissions and absolute annual ESD targets (AEAs)) are consistent with the scope of the EUETS for the period from 2013 to 2020.      Table A1.2 Current progress towards 2014 and 2015 ESD targets           Click on the image for interactive data visualisation      Note: Gaps (i.e. surpluses of emission allocations compared with existing emissions) are calculated as ESD targetESD GHG emissions. A positive value indicates a surplus of AEAs (emissions lower than the target), while a negative value indicates a shortfall of AEAs (emissions lower than the target).     Approximated 2015 ESD emissions were estimated by the EEA on the basis of data submitted by Member States.     See section A3.2 with regard to the calculation of 2005 base-year emissions by the EEA.     Source: EC, 2013b, 2013c and 2017; EEA, 2016a, 2016b, 2016c and 2016d; EU, 2009.

A positive value indicates a surplus of AEAs (emissions lower than the target), while a negative value indicates a shortfall of AEAs (emissions lower than the target).     See section A3.2 with regard to the calculation of 2005 base-year emissions by the EEA.     Source: EC, 2013b and 2013c; EEA, 2016e; EU, 2009.        4. Use of flexibilities under the Effort Sharing Decision    The assessment of progress towards the 2020 ESD targets does not directly take into account the possible use of flexibility options as permitted under the ESD, since these are specifically destined for compliance [4]. If these are taken into account, it is apparent that Malta will need to buy additional AEAs from other Member States or use international certificates to comply in the years 2013 to 2015. This is the case because the gaps between emissions and AEA amounts for these years are higher than the 5% that is allowed to be borrowed from the following year (i.e. 0.06million AEAs for Malta).   Taking into account WEM emissions, for all other countries apart from Ireland, the use of the flexibility to carry over AEAs that have not been used in previous years will be sufficient for compliance in the 2013 to 2020 period. Additional measures, as considered in WAM projections, would help Ireland to comply without the need to buy further AEAs.    5. Annual and cumulated gaps between emissions and Effort Sharing Decision targets    Table A1.4 Annual absolute gaps between historic and projected ESD emissions, and annual ESD targets, 20132020           Click on the image for interactive data visualisation      Note: A positive value (green shading) indicates a surplus of AEAs (emissions lower than the target), while a negative value (red shading) indicates a shortfall of AEAs (emissions lower than the target). The darker the colour, the larger the gap (red) or the surplus (green).     The calculations do not take into account any possible use of the flexibilities provided under the ESD (such as trading ESD emission allocations or buying international certificates).     The data are based on ESD emissions for 2013 and 2014 as determined after the 2016 comprehensive review of national GHG inventories, approximated inventory data for 2015 and projections for the 20162020 period. No national approximated GHG data were available for four Member States (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Lithuania and Romania). For these, the EEA GHG emission proxy was used instead. Inconsistencies in the time series between 2015 and 2016 might be observed for some countries. This is likely because projections for the period 20132020 were prepared before actual 2014 and 2015 emissions were available. For the aggregation of projections in the WAM scenario at EU level, WAM projections of Member States which did not report a WAM scenario have been gap-filled using the WEM scenario projections.

The darker the colour, the larger the gap (red) or the surplus (green).     The calculation of the cumulated gap takes only previous years gaps into account, but does not take any possible use of the flexibilities provided under the ESD (such as trading ESD emission allocations or buying international certificates) into account.     The data are based on ESD emissions for 2013 and 2014 as determined after the 2016 comprehensive review of national GHG inventories, approximated inventory data for 2015 and projections for the 20162020 period. No national approximated GHG data were available for four Member States (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Lithuania and Romania). For these, the EEA GHG emission proxy was used instead. Inconsistencies in the time series between 2015 and 2016 might be observed for some countries. This is likely because projections for the period 20132020 were prepared before actual 2014 and 2015 emissions were available. For the aggregation of projections in the WAM scenario at EU level, WAM projections of Member States which did not report a WAM scenario have been gap-filled using the WEM scenario projections.

Reporting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions The assessments of progress towards greenhouse gas (GHG) emission targets presented in this report are, for the most part, based on information submitted by Member States themselves under Regulation (EU) No 525/2013, the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) (EU, 2013a). The initial purposes of the reporting requirements stipulated in the MMR are to enable the European Union (EU) to complete its reporting commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and to evaluate the projected progress of the EU and its Member States towards fulfilling their GHG mitigation commitments under the Kyoto Protocol in annual reports prepared by the European Commission and the European Environment Agency (EEA). Implementing provisions (EU, 2014a) provide a structure and format for the reporting of GHG inventories and approximated GHG inventories, information on policies and measures, GHG projections and the use of auctioning revenue and project credits, and are used for the purposes of the LULUCF (land use, land-use change and forestry) Decision (EU, 2013b). Furthermore, a delegated act (EU, 2014b) defines the substantive requirements for an EU inventory system in order to fulfil the obligations pursuant to Decision 19/CMP.1. 2. Data sources for greenhouse gas emissions The analysis presented in this report is based on several sets of GHG emission data. Historic trends of greenhouse gas emissions GHG emission data for the period from 1990 to 2014 are official data reported by the EU and Member States under the UNFCCC in their corresponding GHG inventory reports (EEA, 2016a and 2016b). The EEA is responsible for the compilation of the EU GHG inventory and, together with the European Topic Centre on Air Pollution and Climate Change Mitigation (ETC/ACM)[1], it implements a quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedure (EC, 2013a) in order to ensure the timeliness, completeness, consistency, comparability, accuracy and transparency of the projections reported by Member States and used in this report. In 2016, a comprehensive review of GHG emission data took place under article 19 of the MMR, in the context of the annual compliance cycle under the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD). This concerned the years 2005, 20082010, 2013 and 2014. Approximated greenhouse gas emissions for 2015 Early approximated (proxy) estimates of 2015 GHG emissions were reported by Member States to the European Commission under the MMR by 31 July 2016. These estimates were aggregated to EU level by the EEA (EEA, 2016c). Bulgaria, Cyprus, Lithuania and Romania did not submit proxy GHG inventories. The missing data were gap filled by EEA and ETC/ACM for the calculation of EU totals. For Luxembourg and Malta, which submitted after the deadline, gap filled estimates were taken into account for the calculation of EU totals, but the assessment of these countries progress towards ESD targets in 2015 was based on the reported data. Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union Emissions Trading System since 2005 Data relative to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) are used to analyse emission trends in the EUETS, but also to determine the level of emissions covered under the ESD. For the years 20052012, ETS emissions include estimates to reflect the scope of the EU ETS for the third trading period. These data are publicly available from the European Union Transaction Log (EUTL)[2]and the EEA ETS data viewer (EEA, 2016d). The data considered in the analysis were extracted from the EUTL on 13 September 2016. Emissions covered under the Effort Sharing Decision For the purpose of analysing emission trends in the ESD, historic 2005 ESD emissions are calculated using the latest GHG inventory data, from which ETS emissions and CO2 emissions from domestic aviation are subtracted. ETS emissions include estimates to reflect the scope of the EU ETS for the third trading period for the years 20052012. The ESD GHG emission data for the years 2013 and 2014 are consistent with the outcome of the 2016 comprehensive review of national GHG inventory data pursuant to Article 19(1) of the MMR, which was concluded on 30 August 2016. The data used by the Commission to determine Member Statess compliance under the ESD for 2013 and 2014 will be made publicly available (EC, 2016 and 2017). Long-term historic trends of Emissions Trading System and Effort Sharing Decision emissions For Figure 1.2, Figure 1.3 and Figure 1.4, GHG emissions for the years 19902015 are split into those covered by the EU ETS and those covered by the ESD. These splits are based on the application of a fixed percentage for each of the main source categories defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for the reporting of national GHG inventories:  energy sector (IPCC sectors 1.A.1, 1.B and 1.C): 90% for ETS/10% for ESD; the manufacturing and construction sector (IPCC sector 1.A.2): 71% for ETS/29% for ESD; the residential and commercial sectors (IPCC sectors 1.A.4 and 1.A.5): 1% for ETS/99% for ESD; the industrial processes sector (IPCC sector 2): 60% for ETS/40% for ESD; the transport (without aviation), agriculture and waste sectors (IPCC sectors 1.A.3, 3 and 5): 100% for ESD; the aviation sector (IPCC sector 1A3a and memo item international bunkers): 34% for ETS.  Projections for ETS and ESD are reported by source categories. The separation of ETS GHG emissions into source categories was partly carried out by applying average sectoral percentages to total ETS GHG emissions for Poland only. The 2005 Effort Sharing Decision base-year emissions The 2005 ESD base-year emissions are calculated by EEA, so as to be consistent with both:  the relative 2020 ESD target (as a percentage of 2005 emissions) defined in the ESD (EU, 2009); the absolute 2020 ESD target determined by the Commission (EC, 2013b and 2013c).  The EEA calculates 2005 ESD base-year emissions as follows: ESD base-year emissions=2020 absolute target/(1+% of 2020 ESD target) These calculated ESD base-year emissions can also be used to, for example, compare relative changes in ESD emissions with 2020 ESD targets expressed in percentage. In this report, calculated 2005 ESD base-year emissions are used to express the distance between ESD emissions and ESD targets in a normalised way (see, for example, Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2). The distance, calculated as the absolute difference between emissions and targets divided by 2005 base-year emissions, is expressed in percentage points (a proportion of 2005 base-year emissions). It is then directly comparable with targets and reductions as percentages of 2005 levels and allows relevant comparisons from one Member State to another (see section A3.3). These calculated 2005 ESD base-year emissions may differ, sometimes significantly, from actual historic 2005 emissions under the ESD based on the latest GHG inventories, ETS verified emissions and EEA estimate of emissions for 20052012 to reflect the current scope of the EUETS (see above). Projections of greenhouse gas emissions The report uses GHG projection data that are reported biennially by Member States under the MMR (EEA, 2016e). Mandatory reporting takes place every 2 years (2013, 2015, etc.). Member States must also report substantial changes to projections every other year (2014, 2016, etc.). Member States have submitted projections as follows:  In 2015, all Member States except Greece submitted projections. In 2016, eight Member States (Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Ireland, Greece, Hungary and Luxembourg) as well as Norway and Switzerland provided updated projections. All updated projections have been included until 7 July 2016.  Under the MMR, Member States report projections in two scenarios:  A with existing measures (WEM) scenario, which considers the implementation of existing (already implemented) measures, can be applied. If available, a with additional measures (WAM) scenario, which also considers the implementation of additional measures (at planning stage), can be applied. In 2015, 18 Member States reported projections on the basis of such WAM scenarios: Austria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain and the United Kingdom. For the aggregation of a WAM scenario at EU level, Member States that have not reported a WAM scenario have been gap-filled using the WEM scenario.  An overview of projected emissions for both scenarios is presented inTable 2 of the annex Background information - International climate commitments in Europe Member States reported projections for total and sectoral GHG emissions, as well as a split of these projections between those covered by the EU ETS and those covered by the ESD, by source categories[3]. Although projections of total emissions are relevant to the assessment of the EUs progress towards its 20% reduction target by 2020, the assessment of the projected progress of Member States towards their national 2020 targets, set under the ESD as part of the climate and energy package, is based on projection data on emissions not covered by the EUETS, i.e. ESD projections. The EEA implements a quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedure in order to ensure the timeliness, completeness, consistency, comparability, accuracy and transparency of the projections reported by Member States and used in this report. This procedure is described inElements of the Union system for policies and measures and projections and the quality assurance and control (QA/QC) programme as required under Regulation (EU) No 525/2013(EC, 2015). If significant discrepancies can be observed between the inventory value for the reference year and the projected year, an alignment of the level of projections is performed. Such calibration is performed in order to match national projections with a common reference year for aggregated EU projections, which is the year 2013. When such calibration took place in 2015, national GHG inventory data as of 30 June 2015 were used. For updated projections, calibrations were performed in 2016 against national GHG inventory data from 15 January 2016. Calibrations took place for Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Malta, the Netherlands and Portugal.

Annual emission targets (annual emission allocations) under the Effort Sharing Decision for the period from 2013 to 2020 The annual emission allocation (AEA) values for the period from 2013 to 2020 were defined in Commission Decision No 2013/162/EU (EC, 2013b) and adjusted according to Commission Implementing Decision No 2013/634/EU (EC, 2013c), in order to reflect the change in scope of the EU ETS in 2013. 3. Tracking progress towards targets under the Effort Sharing Decision The progress of Member States towards their targets under the ESD is assessed by comparing ESD GHG emission levels with the relevant annual targets under the ESD. The assessment does not take into account the possible use of flexibility options as permitted under the ESD and is therefore not an assessment of compliance under the ESD. The assessment of current progress towards 2014 ESD targets is based on a comparison between ESD GHG emissions and ESD targets (AEAs) for 2014:  Member States with historic emissions below their annual ESD target are considered to be currently on track towards their targets under the ESD. By contrast, Member States with historic emissions higher than their ESD target are considered not to be currently on track towards their targets under the ESD.  The assessment of projected progress towards 2020 ESD targets is based on a comparison between projected domestic ESD GHG emissions in the WEM scenario in 2020 and ESD targets (AEAs) for 2020:  Member States with WEM projections lower than their 2020 target are projected to be on track towards their targets. Member States with WEM projections higher than their 2020 target are not projectedto be on track towards their targets.  All the data used for this assessment (ESD GHG emissions and absolute annual ESD targets (AEAs)) are consistent with the scope of the EUETS for the period from 2013 to 2020.  Table A1.2 Current progress towards 2014 and 2015 ESD targets  Click on the image for interactive data visualisation Note: Gaps (i.e. surpluses of emission allocations compared with existing emissions) are calculated as ESD targetESD GHG emissions. A positive value indicates a surplus of AEAs (emissions lower than the target), while a negative value indicates a shortfall of AEAs (emissions lower than the target).

Use of flexibilities under the Effort Sharing Decision The assessment of progress towards the 2020 ESD targets does not directly take into account the possible use of flexibility options as permitted under the ESD, since these are specifically destined for compliance [4]. If these are taken into account, it is apparent that Malta will need to buy additional AEAs from other Member States or use international certificates to comply in the years 2013 to 2015. This is the case because the gaps between emissions and AEA amounts for these years are higher than the 5% that is allowed to be borrowed from the following year (i.e. 0.06million AEAs for Malta). Taking into account WEM emissions, for all other countries apart from Ireland, the use of the flexibility to carry over AEAs that have not been used in previous years will be sufficient for compliance in the 2013 to 2020 period. Additional measures, as considered in WAM projections, would help Ireland to comply without the need to buy further AEAs. 5.

"copy2_of_greenhouse-gas-emissions  8. Trends and projections in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey  This chapter presents a short overview of greenhouse gas emission trends and projections in the five countries which are members of the European Environment Agency, but not of the European Union.    8.1 Greenhouse gas emissions   Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey are all Annex I countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway have also closer association with the EU for a number of commitments on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. In particular:     Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway have been participating in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) since 2008.   Iceland decided to jointly fulfil commitments with of the EU and its Member States in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC, i.e. to reduce its GHG emissions by 20% by the year 2020, compared to 1990 levels. As an Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) for the post-2020 agreement under the UNFCCC, Iceland has submitted its commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. It intends to fulfil this commitment jointly with the EU; the details of collective delivery are yet to be determined (Iceland, 2015).   Norway and Iceland have expressed an intention to participate in the joint action taking place in the EU to reduce emissions from sectors not covered by the EU ETS (i.e. in the Effort Sharing legislation for the period from 2021 to 2030). For the period from 2021 to 2030 Norway has made clear that it intends to fully participate in the reduction effort for the non-ETS sectors. As Member State targets range from 0% to -40%, on the basis of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, Norway would be attributed an estimated numerical reduction target of 40% below 2005 levels and flexibility mechanisms will be available for Norway and Iceland as for Member States. Final targets for Iceland and Norway will be determined only when the Commissions legislative proposal on a new effort sharing is adopted (EC, 2016b).     Historic GHG emissions in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey followed very different trends between 1990 and 2014. Updated information on emission projections was only available for Norway and Switzerland (see Figure 3.1).   Iceland also set a long-term GHG mitigation target of between 50% and 75% by the year 2050 compared to GHG emissions in 1990. In 2014, Icelands emissions had increased by 27% compared to 1990 levels. Therefore Iceland does not currently seem to be on track to reach its target for 2020.   Liechtenstein also aims to emit at least 40% less GHG emissions in 2030 compared to 1990 (Liechtenstein, 2015). To attain this target, Liechtenstein has also set itself a sectoral goal: GHG emissions from the energy sector will decrease by 20% between 1990 and 2020. In 2014, Liechtensteins emissions were 10% lower than in 1990. Additional efforts are therefore necessary if Liechtenstein is to reach its 2020 target. For 2030, Liechtenstein has committed to reduce its GHG emissions by 40% compared to 1990 under the UNFCCC [1] .   Norways target is to reduce its GHG emissions by 30 % in 2020 compared to 1990. According to its INDC (Norway, 2015), Norway aims to reduce its GHG emissions by at least 40% in 2030, compared to 1990 [2] . Norway also aims to reduce emissions by the equivalent of 100 % of its own emissions by 2030, thus becoming climate neutral, achieved through emissions trading in the EU, international cooperation on emission reductions, other forms of emissions trading and project based cooperation. In 2014, GHG emissions had increased by 2% compared with 1990.   Switzerlands target is to reduce its GHG emissions by 20% in 2020 compared to 1990. Like Norway, it also sets a more ambitious GHG reduction target of 30% reduction in 2020 compared to 1990, provided that the international community agrees on a stricter climate policy. For 2030, Switzerland submitted an INDC to the UNFCCC which states its intention to reduce its GHG emissions by 50% compared to 1990 levels( 10 ). This target will partly be reached through the use of carbon credits from international mechanisms (Switzerland, 2015). In 2014, emissions in Switzerland were reduced by 9% compared to 1990 levels.   Turkey has submitted an INDC to the UNFCCC with a 21% economy-wide cut in GHG emissions by 2030, compared to a business-as-usual scenario (Turkey, 2015). This implies an increase in GHG emissions limited to a level of 929MtCO 2 -eq. in 2030, which is nearly 5 times the emissions of 1990. To reach its national target, Turkey aims to use carbon credits from international market mechanisms. In 2013, Turkeys GHG emissions had increased by 125% compared to 1990.

"progress-in-reducing-total-eu  2. Progress of the European Union towards its greenhouse gas emission targets  This chapter presents the progress achieved by the European Union in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions in view of its short and longer-term climate mitigation objectives. It also presents trends and projections of emissions in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), under Effort Sharing, as well as for land-use and forestry activities.   2.1 Progress in reducing total greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union   The European Union (EU) is well on track to achieve its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target of a 20% decrease, compared with 1990 levels, by 2020. In 2014, the EUs total GHG emissions were 23% less than 1990 levels [1] , and preliminary estimates suggest that emissions in 2015 were 4451 Mt CO 2 -eq., which is 22% less than 1990 levels. The 0.7% increase observed in 2015 follows an exceptional 4.0% reduction the previous year. Despite this small increase, 2015 levels remained below all historic levels observed between 1990 and 2013.   In 2014 and 2015, emission levels were also lower than anticipated by the latest projections available from Member States. According to these national projections, aggregated EU GHG emissions are expected to decrease until at least 2035 (see Figure 1.1).     According to the scenario with existing measures (WEM), which reflects the effects of all adopted and implemented measures at the time the projections were prepared, GHG emissions will be reduced by 23% by 2020 and by 26% by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels).   According to the scenario with additional measures (WAM), which also takes into account the measures that were at planning stage at the time the projections were prepared [2] , GHG emissions will decrease by 25% by 2020 and by 29% by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels).     Although the 2020 reduction target is expected to be met by a sufficient margin, the policies and measures currently accounted for in national projections will not be sufficient to deliver the savings needed to achieve the EUs reduction target of at least 40% by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels). The pace of GHG emission reductions is actually projected to slow down after 2020, and achieving the mid- and long-term targets will require much faster reductions.   For this reason, a number of policy proposals developed by the European Commission are now being discussed among Member States and by the European Parliament. For example, these concern:     a reform of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) to include a more stringent cap reduction after 2020 (EC, 2015);   new annual binding GHG emission targets for Member States for the period from 2021 to 2030 (a new effort sharing between Member States), specifically covering emissions that are not covered by the EUETS, as well as new flexibilities to achieve these targets (EC, 2016a);   the integration of the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector into the EU 2030 Climate and Energy Framework (EC, 2016b);   a European strategy to cut emissions from the transport sector (EC, 2016c).     Further measures will be proposed in autumn 2016 to address energy efficiency and further develop renewable energy in the EU.   As GHG projections were, for the most part, reported by Member States in the first half of 2015, these proposals (or other policy developments at national level) are not reflected in the Member State projections [3] .   Even if the 2030 target is achieved, a faster pace of emission reductions will be required if the EU is to reach its long-term (2050) decarbonisation objective  a reduction of EU GHG emissions by 80 to 95% compared with 1990 levels. Such a reduction can take place only in the context of a major transformation of the EUs socio-technical systems, such as the energy, food, mobility and urban systems. As the effects of policies and measures often take time to materialise (e.g. increases of energy efficiency in buildings), long-term action should not be delayed. Member States tend to prioritise low-cost mitigation measures, but they should also take into consideration the long-term mitigation potential of other measures, which are often postponed because of the high current costs or other difficulties related to their implementation. However, investments in these measures often make economic sense, even in the short term, as they significantly contribute to the generation of learning effects and thereby foster future cost reductions.

The with existing measures (WEM) scenario reflects existing policies and measures, while the with additional measures (WAM) takes into account the additional effects of planned measures reported by Member States. For the most part, these projections were reported in 2015 and therefore do not reflect the expected effects of recent policy proposals such as the reform of the EU ETS and other measures in non-ETS sectors for the period after 2020.     Source: EEA, 2016a, 2016b, 2016c and 2016d.       2.2 The European Union's policy framework for reducing greenhouse gas emissions   To achieve its future GHG emission targets, the EU has adopted sectoral targets and relevant legislation, for the following divisions:     Emissions from large point sources, mostly from industrial installations, are covered by the EU ETS (EU, 2009a). These represent about 4045% of EU GHG emissions and a large proportion of them falls under the power generation sector. Other activities covered by the EU ETS include cement production, iron and steel production, and oil refining. Since 2012, the EU ETS covers GHG emissions from aviation (EU, 2008). The mitigation of all ETS emissions is being addressed at EU level through a single ETS-wide emission cap [4]  and a carbon market through which emission allowances can be traded.   GHG emissions not covered by the EU ETS are covered under the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) (EU, 2009b). These emissions are from a more diverse range of sectors or activities, including road transport, energy consumption in buildings, agriculture (cattle and soils) and waste management. Since 2013, The ESD sets annual targets for each Member State from 2013 until 2020. Mitigation actions therefore take place at national level, through a combination of EU-driven policies and measures, and national initiatives.   GHG emissions and removals from the LULUCF sector are not covered under either the EU ETS or the ESD. LULUCF activities represent a net reported carbon sink, removing the equivalent of about 7% of the EUs total GHG emissions every year. These removals are not taken into account in the EUs 2020 target under the 2009 climate and energy package. However, in 2016, the European Commission proposed to integrate this sector into the EU 2030 Climate and Energy Framework from 2021 onwards [5] .     Formally speaking, Member States are therefore responsible for reducing or limiting emissions covered under only the ESD, while ETS emissions are tackled at EU level.    GHG emissions in EU ETS sectors and in ESD sectors have been following different trends since 1990 [ 6 ]. The projections reported by Member States also show significant differences between these two categories (see Figure 1.2). These trends are described and analysed in the following sections.             Figure 2.2 ESD, ETS, LULUCF and aviation emission trends and projections, 19902035                    Click on the image for interactive data visualisation     Note: ( a ) Net removals from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) correspond to reported values, which differ from values accounted towards targets.     ( b ) The targets for the period from 2021 to 2030 are based on proposed legislation.     The projected values, starting from 2013, are presented for the with existing measures (WEM) scenario, which reflects existing policies and measures. These projections from Member States were reported, for the most part, in 2015 and therefore do not reflect the expected effects of recent policy proposals such as the reform of the EU ETS and other measures in non-ETS sectors for the period after 2020.     Source: EC, 2013a, 2013b, 2015 and 2016a; EEA, 2016a, 2016b, 2016c, 2016d and 2016e; EU, 2009a.    2.3 Emission trends under the European Union Emissions Trading System   GHG emissions from the sectors covered by the EU ETS have decreased significantly since 1990 (see Figure 1.3). The EU ETS target was defined in order to reduce emissions by 21% between 2005 and 2020. In 2015, EU ETS emissions from Member States stationary installations had already decreased by 24% since 2005, and reached their lowest level since the start of the scheme in 2005 [7] . The decrease since 2005 was mostly driven by reductions in emissions related to power generation. The reduction in emissions was largely the result of changes in the combination of fuels used to produce heat and electricity, in particular a decrease in the use of hard coal and lignite fuels, and a substantial increase in electricity generation from renewables, which almost doubled over the period. Emissions from the other industrial activities covered by the EU ETS have also decreased since 2005, but remained stable in the current trading period (20132015) (EEA, 2016f).   According to the projections submitted by Member States in 2015 and 2016, future cuts in national GHG emissions will take place mainly under the EUETS. With the existing measures in place, emissions from stationary installations under the EU ETS are projected to decrease by 7% between 2015 and 2020, and by 5% between 2020 and 2030. According to scenarios that consider additional measures, reductions of an additional four percentage points are projected for 2020 and 2030, compared with the reductions predicted by the scenario with existing measures. Most of the projected reductions by 2020 and 2030 are expected to occur in the energy industries sector, while emissions from other activities are envisaged to remain relatively stable during this period. However, emissions from international aviation nearly doubled between 1990 and 2014 and are expected to increase further by 2030.

Dashed lines represent projections of the WEM scenario. Dotted lines represent projections under the WAM scenario.     The EU ETS GHG emissions presented were estimated based on the attribution of GHG emissions, reported by source categories in national GHG inventories and national projections, to EU ETS sectors and/or non-ETS sectors.     Source: EEA, 2016a, 2016b, 2016c and 2016d.       2.4 Emission trends under the Effort Sharing   GHG emissions from sectors covered by the ESD have decreased since 1990, albeit at a slower rate than those covered under the EU ETS. This reflects the diversity (and mitigation potentials) of the sectors covered by the ESD. In 2014, ESD emissions were 13% below 2005 levels. Preliminary estimates indicate that, in 2015, ESD emissions increased back to a level that is 11% less than the 2005 level. However, this still represents a reduction that is greater than the 9% reduction objective for ESD emissions between 2005 and 2020 at EU level.   According to national projections based on the WEM scenario, ESD emissions could be 155MtCO 2 -eq. below the ESD target for 2020, and cumulated ESD emissions in the EU for the whole 20132020 period could be lower than the overall emission budget for all Member States under the ESD by about 1600MtCO 2 -eq. In addition, if planned additional measures are taken into account, this cumulated surplus could increase to over 1700MtCO 2 -eq. However, certain Member States experience more difficulties than others in achieving their ESD targets (see Chapter 2).   For 2030, Member States project a 16% reduction of ESD emissions compared to 2005 in the WEM scenario, and a 19% reduction in the WAM scenario. These reductions remain insufficient compared with the 30% reduction that non-ETS sectors should achieve by 2030, as a contribution to delivering the EU target of an at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 (see Figure 1.2).   Since 1990, the building sectors have contributed most to absolute emission reductions in the sectors covered by the ESD. However, emissions from the transport sector, which is the largest contributor to GHG emissions under the ESD, increased continuously between 1990 and 2007. After a decrease between 2007 and 2013, emissions from this sector increased again in 2014 and 2015.   Member States have projected only limited decreases in ESD emissions between 2015 and 2030, particularly for after 2020. The largest decreases are expected to take place in the building sector. In the transport sector, emissions are projected to remain relatively stable, while agriculture emissions are anticipated to increase. Implementing the additional measures (i.e. at planning stage up to early 2015) would lead to minor further emission decreases, especially in the building and transport sectors (see Figure 1.4).

Dashed lines represent projections in the with existing measures (WEM) scenario. Dotted lines represent projections under the with additional measures (WAM) scenario.

Source: EEA, 2016a, 2016b, 2016c and 2016d.       2.5 Emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry   Land use and forestry activities, which include the use of soils, trees, plants, biomass and timber, can result in both emissions and removals of CO 2 . In 2014, the LULUCF sector represented a net carbon sink of about 308MtCO 2 -eq. in the whole of the EU. The sector constituted a net reported sink for all EU Member States except Denmark, Ireland, Latvia and the Netherlands. The EU sink was dominated by CO 2  absorbed from existing and new forests. Over the past decade, the relatively large proportion of young forests and moderate harvest rates have led to a net carbon accumulation in European forests.   While being a net sink, the sector was also the source of CO 2  emissions. The largest source was land conversion, especially from forests to other land uses (also known as deforestation), and emissions from organic soils converted to cropland use. Since 2000, the net reported annual LULUCF sink has been on average 320MtCO 2 -eq., with a decreasing trend over the last 7 years. According to the EU Reference Scenario 2016 (EC, 2016d), the net reported LULUCF sink in the EU is expected to continue decreasing, by about 10% between 2010 and 2020, despite a decrease in emissions from cropland and grassland (due to reduced rates of land conversion to cropland, and lower emissions expected from agricultural soils). The current EU forest sink could also potentially be affected by the increased use of bioenergy.   In order to address this overall projected decrease, in July 2016, the Commission proposed a binding commitment for each Member State covering GHG from forestry and agriculture, and an upgrade of accounting rules to determine compliance. These changes are expected to improve the identification of additional mitigation action, and to thereby enhance the environmental integrity of the sector. Stronger incentives for action are also provided by enabling trade between Member States within the LULUCF sector, and creating a limited flexibility for the use of certain, robust LULUCF credits with other non-ETS sectors.   The proposal requires, as a principal commitment, each Member State to ensure that accounted GHG emissions from land use are entirely compensated by an equivalent removal of CO 2  from the atmosphere in non-ETS sectors (the no debit rule). In essence, if a Member State converts forests to other land uses (deforestation) or increases emissions from croplands, it must compensate for the resulting emissions by planting new forests (afforestation), by improving the sustainable management of existing forests, croplands and grasslands, by using allocations from the other non-ETS sectors, or by agreeing to trade emission credits with other Member States. Although Member States undertook this commitment under the Kyoto Protocol up to 2020, the proposal enshrines the commitment in EU law for the 20212030 period.,2.1 Progress in reducing total greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union The European Union (EU) is well on track to achieve its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target of a 20% decrease, compared with 1990 levels, by 2020. In 2014, the EUs total GHG emissions were 23% less than 1990 levels[1], and preliminary estimates suggest that emissions in 2015 were 4451 Mt CO2-eq., which is 22% less than 1990 levels. The 0.7% increase observed in 2015 follows an exceptional 4.0% reduction the previous year. Despite this small increase, 2015 levels remained below all historic levels observed between 1990 and 2013. In 2014 and 2015, emission levels were also lower than anticipated by the latest projections available from Member States. According to these national projections, aggregated EU GHG emissions are expected to decrease until at least 2035 (see Figure 1.1).  According to the scenario with existing measures (WEM), which reflects the effects of all adopted and implemented measures at the time the projections were prepared, GHG emissions will be reduced by 23% by 2020 and by 26% by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels). According to the scenario with additional measures (WAM), which also takes into account the measures that were at planning stage at the time the projections were prepared[2], GHG emissions will decrease by 25% by 2020 and by 29% by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels).  Although the 2020 reduction target is expected to be met by a sufficient margin, the policies and measures currently accounted for in national projections will not be sufficient to deliver the savings needed to achieve the EUs reduction target of at least 40% by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels). The pace of GHG emission reductions is actually projected to slow down after 2020, and achieving the mid- and long-term targets will require much faster reductions. For this reason, a number of policy proposals developed by the European Commission are now being discussed among Member States and by the European Parliament. For example, these concern:  a reform of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) to include a more stringent cap reduction after 2020 (EC, 2015); new annual binding GHG emission targets for Member States for the period from 2021 to 2030 (a new effort sharing between Member States), specifically covering emissions that are not covered by the EUETS, as well as new flexibilities to achieve these targets (EC, 2016a); the integration of the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector into the EU 2030 Climate and Energy Framework (EC, 2016b); a European strategy to cut emissions from the transport sector (EC, 2016c).  Further measures will be proposed in autumn 2016 to address energy efficiency and further develop renewable energy in the EU. As GHG projections were, for the most part, reported by Member States in the first half of 2015, these proposals (or other policy developments at national level) are not reflected in the Member State projections[3]. Even if the 2030 target is achieved, a faster pace of emission reductions will be required if the EU is to reach its long-term (2050) decarbonisation objective  a reduction of EU GHG emissions by 80 to 95% compared with 1990 levels.

"milan-uhersky-brod-nicosia-take  Milan, Uherský Brod, Nicosia take top prizes in ‘My City’ photo competition  Photos taken in Milan (Italy), Uherský Brod (Czech Republic), Nicosia (Cyprus), have won the top three prizes in the European Environment Agency (EEA) photo competition which this year encouraged photographers to share moments captured in urban areas where they live, work, rest and play.   This year’s theme focused on ‘My City’ and aimed to raise awareness of environmental challenges cities face and how cities contribute to quality of life in Europe. Around 75 % of the European Union’s population live in urban areas. Cities provide Europeans many amenities as well as cultural, educational and health services. While cities are the engine of Europe’s economy and creators of European wealth, they depend heavily on resources of other regions to meet their demand for resources like energy, water, food, and to accommodate waste and emissions.   Photographers across Europe – amateur and professional – were invited to share what their urban environment means for them. Participants could choose to depict a European city of their choice to tell a positive or negative story through their photos.   The winners of the three main categories   Leisure time in a city and the  T2gE conference  prize: Erika Zolli’s ‘Levitation’, a dreamlike picture of a woman floating in a park as autumn leaves fall around her, which was taken in Milan’s Sempione Park (above).   Getting around in a city: Daniel Kusák’s ‘Sunset around a bridge’,  a colourful silhouette shot alongside a bridge by Uherský Brod’s railway station.

"assessment-2  Exceedance of air quality limit values in urban areas   Air quality in Europe is slowly improving. However, between2000 and 2014, a significant proportion of the urban population in the EU-28 was exposed to concentrations of certain air pollutants above the EU limit or target values. The numbers of people exposed were even higher in relation to the more stringent World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guideline valuesset for the protection of human health.      For fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ),8 - 17 %ofthe urban population were exposed to concentrationsin excess of the EU target value, while85 - 97 % were exposed to concentrations above the WHO guideline value (for2006-2014 only).   For particulate matter (PM 10 ), the respective exposure estimates were16 - 42% for the EU limit value and 50 - 92 % for theWHO guideline value.   For ozone (O 3 ), estimates was 8 - 55 % for the EU target value and 94 - 99 % for theWHO guideline value.   For nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), estimates were 7 - 31 % in both cases (EU limit value and WHO guideline).   For benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), estimates were 17 - 24 %for the EU target valueand 81 - 91 % for the estimated reference level (for 2008-2014 only).     air quality pm10 quality of life air pollution air ozone pm2.5 health no2         CSI CSI004 004,Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) Before 2006, the number of PM2.5 monitoring stations in certain areas of the EU-28 was low, meaning measurements before that year are not considered representative of the overall air quality status. Since then, the monitoring coverage has improved and is now more representative of Europes air quality(NB: the newest EU Member State, Croatia, has not yet reported data on urban PM2.5 measurements). Between 2006 and 2014, 8 - 17 % of the EU-28's urban population is estimated to have been exposed to concentrations of PM2.5 in excess of the EU target value set for the protection of human health (Figure 1).  With respect to the more stringent WHO guideline value (Figure 2), a much larger proportion of the urban population (85 - 97 %) was exposed to concentrations above this threshold.  The time series are considered too short to draw any firm conclusion on changes over time, though values have been decreasing after the relative maximum in 2011. Particulate Matter (PM10) Before 2000, the number of PM10monitoring stations in some areas of EU-28 was also low. Since 2000, coverage initially improved in the EU-15 Member States but from 2005 it has improved across the whole EU. Notwithstanding limitations in data coverage in the early 2000s, a significant proportion of the EU-28 urban population (16 - 42 %) was exposed to concentrations of PM10in excess of the EU daily limit value set for the protection of human health between 2000 and 2014 (Figure 1). A slightly decreasing tendency can be observed throughout the whole period. For the more stringent WHO guideline value (Figure 2), a higher proportion of the urban population (50 - 92 %) was exposed to concentrations above this threshold. Here, a decreasing tendency is also observed, as in the case of the EU limit value, until it reached 50 % in the most recent available year (2014). 2014 was the first year in which less than half of the urban population was exposed to concentrations exceeding the WHO guideline. Ozone (O3) Although reductions in European emissions of ozone precursors have led to lower peak concentrations of ozone, the current long term objective is frequently exceeded by more than 25 days. During the 2000-2014 period, between 8 % (in 2014) and 55 % (in 2003) of the urban population was exposed to concentrations above the long term objective for more than 25 days (Figure 1). In the last seven years, the proportion of the urban population exposed has not exceeded 20 % and reached a minimum of 8 % in 2014.  In relation to the more stringent WHO guideline (Figure 2), the proportion of the population exposed to concentrations above the guideline value is as high as 94  99 %, with no discernible change over time. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) Between 2000 and 2014, the fraction of the urban population exposed to concentrations in excess of the EU limit value and the identical WHO guideline value gradually decreased to around 10 %, with a minimum of 7 % in 2014 (Figures 1 and 2). At 31 %, the highest proportion of the urban population exposed occurred in 2003. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) There are relatively few reported measurements of BaP and these were not considered to be homogeneous across Europe until 2008. Considering data reported after that year, the fraction of the urban population exposed to concentrations above the BaP target value has shown little variation within the range of 17 - 24 %.  When considering the estimated 'reference level' for BaP, the proportion of the population exposed is much higher (81 - 91 %) and almost constant over the period.  Sulfur dioxide (SO2) The results for SO2 show that the proportion of the urban population exposed to concentrations above the daily EU limit value decreased between 2000 and 2014 to less than 0.1 % in the last four years (with a maximum of 3 % in 2006).   With respect to the WHO guideline, following a steady decrease from a maximum of 85 % in 2000, around 38 % of urban population was exposed to levels above this guideline value in 2014. Note to Figures 1 and 2:  Differentnumbers of countries are included in the illustrated data sets over time. Of the 18 Member States with PM2.5 data from 2006 or before, there are no data available for Ireland in 2006 and 2012; and for Greece in 2006 and 2014.

Croatia is not included due to lack of data from urban and suburban stations for the whole period. Of the 18 countries with PM10 data from 2000 or before, there are no data available for Bulgaria and Hungary in 2002; for Ireland in 2000; and for Lithuania in 2000, 2001 and 2002.

"restoring-european-rivers-and-lakes  Restoring European rivers and lakes in cities improves quality of life   Rivers and lakes located in European cities and towns are getting cleaner thanks to improvements in waste water treatment and restoration projects which have brought many waterways back to life. New forms of water management contribute to make our cities greener, smarter and more sustainable, but key challenges remain, according to a new report by the European Environment Agency (EEA) released today.   The EEA report ‘ Rivers and lakes in European cities: Past and future challenges ,’ assesses the strategies and measures authorities have taken in urban centres to improve the state of local rivers and lakes. These can serve as useful examples of lessons learned on urban planning and design approaches for socially and environmentally-resilient cities. Case studies involving 17 cities from across Europe, including Aarhus, Bucharest, Leipzig, Madrid, Oslo and Vienna, were screened for the assessment. The report looks at the major challenges urban river and lakes have to deal with, including availability and supply of drinking water, water quality, flood protection and management, well-being and quality of life benefits, and stakeholder involvement in governance issues.   Rivers and lakes have played a key role in the development of European cities and towns, but arguably urbanisation has come at a high cost. Most urban rivers were channelled into canals, buried or otherwise confined. Industrialisation has led to further degradation, with waterways becoming dumping grounds for sewage, pollutants and other wastewater, generating significant public health issues. Restricting or altering the flow of rivers has also increased flood risks. However, with improvements in wastewater treatment and reduced industrial activities over the past three decades, urban rivers and lakes have become increasingly important in meeting the demand for a better, more sustainable quality of life. Urban rivers and lakes have gained a more positive image, providing space for recreation and offering an aesthetically pleasing environment as part of city regeneration projects.   Cleaner rivers and lakes are a win-win for cities and towns   The report stresses that the restoration of rivers and lakes is a win-win situation, by improving flood control and ecological functions while offering recreational value and raising the quality of life in urban areas. Well-functioning and healthy waterways also mitigate the impacts of climate change in the city, such as increased temperatures already observed in city centres. The report calls for the proper implementation of European legislation, including the Water Framework Directive, Floods Directive and Habitats Directive to help deliver benefits. And it suggests that urban planning authorities also take into account more stringent adaptation measures to mitigate the effects of climate change and to step up cooperation between water and development planners as well as including the views of city residents.   Success stories   In recent decades, improvements in wastewater treatment and reduced industrial activities have improved water quality in most European cities, which in turn has been beneficial for river and lake ecology. Until 2011, Bucharest discharged wastewater from more than 2 million inhabitants without treatment into the Dâmbovița river, but a new wastewater treatment plant started operating five years ago and treats the entire wastewater flow of the Bucharest urban area, eliminating one of the major pollution hotspots in the Danube river basin.   In many European capitals (Paris, London, Dublin, Stockholm and Oslo), the return of fish has signalled cleaner waters, and in some cities it is now possible again to bathe in the waters close to the city centre such as the Harbour baths in Copenhagen or swimming in the River Isar in Munich.   Over the last century, many urban rivers were channelled into canals, buried or otherwise confined. This report describes how several cities and towns have dealt with the impacts of physical modifications such as giving room for the river or opening covered river stretches. The report also includes examples of multifaceted restoration projects focused on reducing flood risks and opening the city towards the rivers, creating new green recreational spaces.           urban urban waste water urban waste water treatment directive green cities river restoration city quality of life floodplain restoration water quality rivers and lakes,The EEA report ‘Rivers and lakes in European cities: Past and future challenges,’ assesses the strategies and measures authorities have taken in urban centres to improve the state of local rivers and lakes.

"assessment-2  Exposure of ecosystems to acidification, eutrophication and ozone     In the EU-28, critical loads for acidification were exceeded in 7 % of the ecosystem area in 2010, down from 43 % in 1980 (and decreased to 7 %  of the ecosystem area across all EEA member countries). There are still some areas where the interim objective for reducing acidification, as defined in the EU's National Emission Ceilings Directive, has not been met.   The EU-28 ecosystem area in which the critical loads for eutrophication were exceeded peaked at 84 % in 1990 and decreased to 63 % in 2010 (55 % in the EEA member countries). The area in exceedance is projected to further decrease to 54 % in 2020 for the EU-28 (48 % in the EEA member countries), assuming current legislation is implemented. The magnitude of the exceedances is also projected to decline considerably in most areas, except for a few 'hot spot' areas in western France and the border areas between the Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as in northern Italy.   Looking forward, only 4 % of the EU-28 ecosystem area (3 % in EEA member countries) is projected to exceed acidification critical loads in 2020 if current legislation is fully implemented.The eutrophication reduction target set in the updated EU air pollution strategy proposed by the European Commission in late 2013, will be met by 2030 if it is assumed that all maximum technically feasible reduction measures are implemented, but it will not be met by current legislation.    For ozone, most of Europe's vegetation and agricultural crops are exposed to ozone levels that exceed the long term objective specified in the EU's Air Quality Directive. A significant fraction is also exposed to levels above the target value threshold defined in the directive. During the past five years, the fractions of agricultural crops above the target value were the lowest since 1996. In 2013, the fraction decreased to around the 21 %,  compared with   a relative peak of 27 %   in 2012 . The effect-related concentrations show large year-to-year variations. Over the period 1996-2013,   exposure   increased until   2006, after which it decreased.    During the past five years, around two-thirds of the forest area was exposed to ozone concentrations above the critical level set by the    United Nations Economic Commission for Europe  (  UNECE) for the protection of forests.     eutrophication deposition of acidifying air pollutants csi air pollution air ozone effects on ecosystems air emissions aot40 air quality acidification atmospheric deposition of nutrient nitrogen forest             CSI CSI005 005,Acidification and eutrophication In most European countries, the area at risk of acidification was below 10 % in 2010 and is projected to decrease further by 2020, when current legislation is fully implemented (Figure 8). In addition, the magnitude of exceedance was below 50 eq H+ ha-1 a-1 in most countries in 2010, and will reach values close to zero in 2020. However, there are a few exceptions, particularly in the Czech Republic, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Poland where exceedances were still high in 2010, and the acidification problem is not predicted to be solved by 2020. As SO2 emissions have fallen, the relative contribution made by ammonia (NH3) emitted from agricultural activities and nitrogen oxides (NOX) emitted from combustion processes to surface water and soil acidification has increased or become predominant in some regions in Europe. The ecosystem area where critical loads for nutrient nitrogen are exceeded was still close to 100 % in many European countries in 2010 (Figure 9). Although a decrease is predicted by 2020 if current legislation is implemented, the exceedance area will be above 50 % in most countries. Extremely high magnitudes of exceedances can be found in countries exposed to high nitrogen deposition, both in 2010 and 2020, particularly in the Denmark, Luxembourg, Hungary, the Netherlands and Switzerland. This is due to high nitrogen deposition rates and/or ecosystems, such as nutrient poor grasslands, which are very sensitive to an excess supply of nitrogen via the atmosphere (see for example EEA, 2014c). Ozone Observed AOT40 concentrations for crops show large variation. Disregarding the extreme peaks in 2003 and 2006 the data show some decreasing tendency after 2001. Between 1996 and 2013, there were 251 rural background stations providing valid data during at least 14 of the 18 years (Figure 10). The spatial coverage of the dataset is limited, and it encompasses 20 countries; in particular, countries in eastern Europe are missing or have a low station density. At 31 (12 %) of the stations, the time series have a tendency to increase, although this increase is statistically significant at only two stations. Of the other 220 stations where a downward tendency was observed, 63 show a significant downward trend.  ,Acidification and eutrophication Exceedances of critical loads for acidification An assessment made by applying the scientific methods used when policy objectives were set, shows that the 2010 interim objective for acidification set in the National Emission Ceiling Directive 2001/81/EC (NEC Directive) was achieved in the vast majority of grid cells across the EU. This means that the area at risk was reduced by more than 50 % in comparison to 1990 in all Member States, except for one grid cell located in northern Germany (EEA, 2012; Hettelingh et al., 2013). Figure 1 shows the exposure and area at risk for European countries between 1980 and 2030, using updated scientific knowledge developed since 2000 (see policy context in the Indicator Specification). The reduction of anthropogenic acidifying emissions since 1980 (see CSI040) is evident. For example, the areas shaded red on the maps (exceedances of more than 1 200 equivalents per hectare per year (eq ha1a1)) show a clear reduction between 1980 and 2010. In the EU-28, the ecosystem area in which acidification critical loads were exceeded decreased from peak values of 43 % in 1980 to 7 % in 2010 (7 % across all EEA member countries). However, in 2010, several areas in the EU-28 did not meet the National Emission Ceiling Directive's (2001/81/EC) interim objective for acidification. When implementing current legislation, only 4 % of the EU-28 ecosystem area was projected to be in exceedance in 2020 (3 % in EEA member countries; see CCE 2014). A few hot spots can still be found particularly in the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Poland. When considering uncertainties in the calculations, the projected area at risk in 2030 is not significantly further reduced if a 'maximum technically feasible reduction' (MTFR) scenario is assumed. Exceedances of critical loads for eutrophication An assessment performed on the basis of 2000 knowledge indicated that the area at risk of eutrophication declined by 34 % in the EU-27 as whole, thus meeting the NEC Directive's objective at EU level (EEA, 2012). However, this is only the case when the original average nitrogen deposition modelling approach is employed to assess attainment. Figure 2 shows the development of eutrophication critical load exceedances in Europe starting in 1980, if present scientific knowledge is applied (see 'policy context' in the Indicator Specification). It also shows the projection of the exceedances in 2020 (current legislation scenario), and the projection of exceedances in 2030 according to a MTFR scenario. The EU-28 ecosystem area in which the critical loads for eutrophication were exceeded peaked at 84 % in 1990 and fell to 63 % in 2010 (55 % in EEA member countries). Most central European areas in which there were very high exceedances in 1980 (red shading: larger than 1200 equivalents of nitrogen per hectare per year) are on track to be markedly reduced by 2020. However, modelling results predict that there will still be hot spots with very high exceedances in western France and the border areas between Belgium,Germany and the Netherlands, as well as in northern Italy. According to the scenario analyses, the EU-28 area at risk due to atmospheric nutrient nitrogen deposition will decrease from 63 % in 2010 to 54 % in 2020 under the 2012 amended Gothenburg Protocol (the figures are 55 % and 48 % respectively for the EEA member countries). Thus, in 2020, more than 50 % of the EU ecosystem areas classified according to the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) are still expected to be at risk of excessive atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. However, the magnitude of exceedance is predicted to fall considerably in these areas (see the equivalent N per hectare per year ranges in Figure 2). In the EU-28, the area at risk of eutrophication is projected to decrease only slightly by 2030. The updated air pollution strategy proposed by the European Commission in late 2013 aims to achieve a situation in which the EU-28 ecosystem area exceeding critical loads for eutrophication is reduced by 35 % by 2030, relative to 2005. This target would be met in 2030 under an MTFR scenario, but would not be met if only current legislation were fully implemented. Ground-level ozone pollution The target value threshold for the protection of vegetation is exceeded in a substantial fraction of the agricultural area of the EEA-33 member countries (excluding Turkey, see note in Figure 3). In 2013, this was the case in about 21 % of a total area of 2.063 million km2 (Figures 3 and 4). Exceedances of the target value threshold have been observed in southern and eastern Europe (see red and dark red areas in Figure 5). The long-term objective has been met in 20 % of the total agricultural area (green areas in figure 5), mainly in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, most of the United Kingdom and the three Baltic countries. In 2003, the meteorological conditions were very favourable for ozone formation resulting in exceptionally high concentrations. Also, compared to other years, in June and July 2006, there were a large number of ozone episodes (EEA, 2007) resulting in much higher accumulated ozone exposure value over a threshold of 40 parts per billion (AOT40). Compared to 2012, the AOT40 values in 2013 were lower in eastern Europe and Italy. Large increases have been noted for the southwestern-part of the Iberian Peninsula, Albania and Macedonia. Based on a model calculation, the NEC Directive 2010 interim objective for critical levels was met in the EU, except in parts of Spain and Portugal. The interim objective for the ozone accumulated concentration has clearly not been achieved in most of Europe. An evaluation of the two objectives on the basis of actual measurements is difficult, due to the lack of monitoring stations in the early 1990s. However, the limited number of available observed time series suggests a rather less optimistic situation than do the model calculations (EEA, 2012). Figure 6 shows a map with the AOT40 results for forests (AOT40f). The gradients of the AOT40f values are similar to those of the AOT40 for crops/protection of vegetation: relatively low in northern Europe, with the highest values observed in the countries around the Mediterranean. The critical level was met (green areas) in 2013 inmost of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and the United Kingdom and in great parts of Sweden and the Atlantic coasts in northwest Europe (the total forested area with concentrations below the critical level is 34 % of a total area of 1.44 million km2). In southern Europe, levels may be as high as 4-5 times above the critical level (red and dark red areas in Figure 6). Figure 7 shows the exposure of forested areas between 2004 and 2013, when large variations were observed. While in 2004 and 2006, almost all forests were exposed to levels exceeding the critical level, in 2007 40 % of forests were exposed to levels lower than the critical level. This percentage has been more or less stable since then (with a decrease in 2008). No significant upward or downward trend could be detected."
"fish-to-fork-a-need  Fish to fork: a need to implement changes in the food system  Securing our need for food has become a major threat to the environment, driving increased emissions and over-exploitation of natural resources such as water, soil and fish. Our health and well-being have also been affected. Ensuring nutritious food for all in a fair and environmentally sound way has become a societal, economic and policy challenge across the world. A shared understanding of the food system and the roles different actors — policy makers, producers and other stakeholders in the food supply-chain — play will be crucial to a sustainable future, according to a new European Environment Agency report published today.   The report  ‘Seafood in Europe; a food system approach for sustainability’  takes an in-depth look at the increasingly complex evolution of the global food system and what this means for Europe. With a focus on seafood, the report explores the knowledge base on food systems and assesses the implications of such a food system analysis for EU policy and knowledge development. The EU has committed to align its practices to new global sustainability goals, as recently set out in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and as part of the EU's 2050 goal of living well within the limits of our planet. The food system — which in general terms includes all the materials, processes and infrastructures relating to production, trade, transport, retail, and consumption of food products and the outputs of these activities — will have to change to meet these goals.      Fish as food matters for the EU   Global changes such as population growth, urbanisation and rising incomes explain the increase in global food demand. Part of this demand is to be met by fish, which will mostly come from aquaculture. Currently, most of the world´s fisheries are either fully fished (58 %) or overfished (31 %). In Europe's seas, overfishing remains high: 50 % of fish stocks in the north-east Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea, and over 90 % in the Mediterranean and Black Seas are fished above their maximum sustainable yield. Globally, as we reach the natural limits for the oceans to provide more fish to our food supply, the rapid expansion of aquaculture will be the main driver of growth in production. Already, in 2014, for the first time in history, more fish for human consumption have originated from farms than from wild capture.   These trends matter for the EU's food and nutrition security since fish is already an important source of food. Europeans favour wild fish (75 % of consumed fish products come from fisheries) and the average fish consumption per capita in the EU is the second highest in the world (at around 22 kg/person/year). To meet this demand, the EU sources more than half (55%) of its seafood from abroad. It is the largest importer of seafood and fish products in the world, with a market share of 20 % of total global imports between 2013 and 2015.   Boosting efforts to implement an ecosystem approach to Europe's seas — a key principle in several EU policies — is critical, the report adds. Measures such as respecting sustainable levels in fisheries or implementing networks of marine protected areas are essential for ensuring the long-term viability of fisheries and the availability of resources on which the whole food supply-chain depends.   Mind the knowledge gap   Current assessments tend to focus on the environmental impact of fisheries and aquaculture on Europe’s marine ecosystems or the economic performance of the sectors, both of which are critical. However, significant information and knowledge gaps to understand key interactions on the journey of fish to fork exist. There is limited information available beyond market data that enables tracing the EU's need for seafood outside its borders. International trade and market dynamics mask vital signs from ecosystems, such as the state of local fish stocks. According to the EEA report, filling some of these knowledge gaps does not necessarily require big investments. There is already a wealth of existing data and information, such as those from the EU Common Fisheries Policy. These could be further explored to better link what is happening at sea to what and who is driving the production of seafood.       common fisheries policy aquatic ecosystems food system seafood system fish to fork sustainable food consumption sustainable consumption and production sustainable development goals,The report ‘Seafood in Europe; a food system approach for sustainability’ takes an in-depth look at the increasingly complex evolution of the global food system and what this means for Europe.

"assessment-1  Population trends 1950  2100: globally and within Europe   The worlds population increased from 2.5 billion in 1950 to around 7.3 billion in 2015, and is expected to continue to rise until 2050/2100 under most UN projection variants. Assuming the medium fertility projection variant, global population might increase to 9.7 billion by 2050, and rise further to 11.2 billion by 2100. However, if fertility and mortality rates stay at current levels (i.e. assuming the no change projection variant), growth rates are projected to be substantially higher, with global population possibly rising to 10.2 billion by 2050 and 19.3 billion by 2100.   The expected global population growth is projected to be largely driven by increases in Asia and particularly in Africa. While the Asian population is expected to peak by 2050, Africas population is projected to grow strongly and continuously, from 1.2 billion today to about 4.5 billion by 2100, under medium fertility assumptions.   The total population of the EU-28 is projected to increase slightly from 505 million currently to 510 million by 2030, and then to decrease in the subsequent decades to some 465 million by 2100, under medium fertility assumptions. The age structure is projected to change substantially, with an increase of the share of people aged 65 years or older from 19 % currently to 30 % by 2050 and further to 32 % by 2100, under medium fertility assumptions.   global megatrends human population  Outlook Outlook042 042,The world's population has almost tripled over the last 60 years, rising from ca. 2.5 billion in 1950 to around 7.3 billion in 2015 (Figure 1). As shown in Figure 1, there is significant variation across the different UN projection variants as to how global population might develop over the coming decades. By 2050, global population is projected to be between 8.7 billion (low fertility projection variant) and 10.9 billion (constant fertility projection variant). Assuming the medium fertility projection variant, global population is expected to increase to 9.7 billion by 2050. The spread across the different UN projection variants increases further for the period 2050-2100, reflecting the increasing uncertainties inherent in such long-term projections. According to the low fertility projection variant, global population might peak around 2050 and decrease to 7.3 billion by 2100, which is about its current size. At the other extreme, under the assumption of constant fertility rates (as estimated for the period 2010-2015) but increasing life expectancy (e.g. due to improved health care systems), global population could increase to as much as 26 billion by 2100. If both fertility rates and life expectancy remain constant between 2010 and 2015 (no change projection variant), global population could reach 19.3 billion by 2100. Assuming the medium fertility projection variant  i.e. globally increasing life expectancy combined with increasing fertility rates in current low fertility regions but decreasing fertility rates in current very high fertility regions  global population is expected to increase to 11.2 billion by 2100 (Figure 1). The huge spread across the UN projection variants towards the end of the 21st century also illustrates the effects of alternative assumptions related to fertility and mortality. For example, the considerably higher number for the constant fertility compared to the no change projection variant is due to the assumption that life expectancy will increase over time in the constant fertility projection variant. Moreover, the lower values of the high fertility projection variant, in comparison with the constant fertility and no change projection variants, illustrate that it actually assumes a considerable reduction in fertility rates in many countries, compared to current levels. The assumption of the medium variant, therefore, is that fertility rates will experience a stronger drop, compared to the assumption for the high fertility projection variant. A more detailed analysis of the medium fertility scenario by world regions reveals that the projected increase in global population is largely driven by increases in Asia and Africa. The Asian population tripled between 1950 and2015, rising from 1.4 billion to 4.4 billion, and Asia is projected to remain the most populous world region throughout the 21st century (Figure 2). Its total population is projected to increase by about another billion to 5.3 billion by 2060, but to slightly decrease to 4.9 billion by 2100. Africas population has increased 5-fold from 1950 to 2015, rising from around 200 million to 1.2 billion, and is projected to grow substantially and continuously to 2.5 billion by 2050 and 4.4 billion by 2100 (Figure 2).,The population of the current EU-28 increased from 380 million in 1950 to 505 million in 2015 (Figure 3). The medium fertility projection variant assumes a relatively stable EU-28 population throughout the 21st century, with a slight increase to 510 million by 2030, and a decrease in subsequent decades to 465 million by 2100 (Figure 3). Other UN projection variants assume stronger changes in total EU population over time, and most of them predict a considerable population decline. The greatest declines occur under low fertility, and, particularly, under no change assumptions. If fertility rates, life expectancy and migration rates stay at current levels, the EU-28 population will drop to 360 million by 2100, which would mean a loss of about 30 % of its current size. Only under high fertility and instant replacement assumptions, would the EU-28 population grow towards 2100 (to 680 million and 605 million, respectively, Figure 3). Strongly linked to the projected trend of a decreasing EU population is the growing share of older individuals. The share of persons aged 65 years and older of the total EU population doubled from 1950 to 2015, rising from 8.9 % to 19.2 % (Figure 4). Over the coming decades, the EU ageing trend is projected to continue. By 2050, the share of persons aged 65 years and older is projected to be between 27 % (high fertility' scenario) to 33 % (low fertility scenario), and might further increase to 41 % by 2100 under low fertility assumptions (Figure 4). Ageing populations are also projected to become a global phenomenon in the coming decades  for example, assuming the medium fertility variant, the global share of persons aged 65 and older is projected to rise from 8.3 % currently to 16 % by 2050 and 23 % by 2100 (Figure 4). Population trends across EU member countries are more complex, with the population of some countries projected to decrease significantly, while others are projected to increase between now and 2100. Thus, the national level assessment of this indicator is limited to exploring some of the most striking trends according to the medium variant scenario. For example, by around 2050 Germany is projected to be replaced as the most populous EU member country by the United Kingdom (Figure 5). As the UKs population increase is based, in part, upon substantial levels of immigration, it is an example of how migration might play a role in determining developments in population size across European countries over the coming decades. Other currently populous EU countries, such as Romania, Poland and Italy, are projected to experience a continuous and significant drop in population (Figure 5). A comparison of changes in total population from 2010 to 2100 across the EU-28 and EEA member countries shows that eastern European countries in particular, but also countries such as Germany or Portugal, are projected to be affected by large-scale population decreases (see Figure 6). In contrast, the population size of many northern and western European countries is projected to rise. Particularly large increases are projected for Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, in part driven by assumptions about immigration and increased life expectancy. Another assessment of EU population trends has been published recently by the European Commission (EC, 2014).

"surplus-emission-permits-start-decreasing  Surplus emission permits start decreasing in the EU’s emissions trading system  The surplus of CO2 emission allowances in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) started declining in 2015. This is the first significant decrease since unused allowances started accumulating in 2008. However, the surplus remains substantial, according to the European Environment Agency’s annual report on the EU’s emissions cap and trade system published today.    The report ‘ Trends and projections in the EU ETS in 2016 – The Emissions Trading System in numbers ,’ provides the latest assessment of past, present and future trends in the system in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and emission allowances. The analysis is based on the latest data available from the European Commission and Member States. The EU ETS is a cornerstone of the EU’s efforts to combat climate change.   Postponing the auctioning of 300 million allowances in 2015 contributed to reducing by 17 % the surplus of 2.1 billion emission allowances that had accumulated in the system since 2008.

Overall, EU ETS emissions decreased by 24 % between 2005 and 2015 and are now below the cap set for 2020. The decrease was mostly driven by changes in the type of fuels used for power generation (less hard coal and lignite fuels and a jump in renewables).

"decommissioning-fossil-fuel-power-plants  Decommissioning fossil fuel power plants between now and 2030 essential for Europe’s low carbon future  Significant changes will be needed in the Member States’ energy-generating mix if the European Union is to meet its 2050 goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95 % compared to 1990 levels, according to a new European Environment Agency (EEA) report published today. While the European Union has made considerable progress in improving energy efficiency and using renewable energy sources, a well-planned transition out of carbon-intensive power generation is needed to meet the long-term aim of creating a low-carbon society.    The EEA report ‘ Transforming the EU power sector: avoiding a carbon lock-in ’ stresses the need for Europe to become more forward-looking when it comes to investing in cleaner energy sources. It calls on the EU to seize the opportunity to 'decarbonise' the energy generating sector, replacing ageing and end-of-life coal-fired plants with renewable energy sources where possible between now and 2030. The report gives a detailed analysis of the energy generating sector, looking specifically at the technical lifetimes of existing fossil fuel capacity across Europe. It also draws a comparison showing that similar lifetimes in the future would be incompatible with the EU’s climate goals and highlights that meeting these goals can only be realised if fossil fuel capacity decreases progressively within this decade.   Europe's electricity generating sector is at the heart of the EU’s decarbonisation strategy. Power generation remains the largest greenhouse gas-emitting sector, being responsible for roughly one third of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions and more than half of the verified emissions under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). As such, the sector has a big role to play in meeting commitments on reducing emissions and improving air quality.   'I welcome today's report 'Transforming the EU power sector: avoiding a carbon lock-in' and am grateful that EEA raised this discussion. It is indeed imperative that new investments that will be done in the next few years go rather towards clean energies such as renewable, and don't result in a carbon lock in from fossil fuels we can't have in our future energy system. The COP21 agreement, negotiated last year, has been ratified by enough countries to enter into force and give Europe a chance to set an example and become the global leader for energy efficiency,' said Maroš Šefčovič, European Commission Vice-President in charge of Energy Union.   'Europe is now generating four times more wind power and 70 times more solar power as in 2005. This is good news, but a clear, forward-looking investment strategy is also necessary across the fossil fuel power sector to meet our long-term challenge to cut CO 2  emissions. Europe is committed to decarbonise its economy so we cannot afford to tie up our investments in emission-intensive technologies. Investing in renewables and energy efficiency provides the best return on our money,' said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director.   Avoiding a ‘carbon lock-in’   The report illustrates that past trends of extending the life of large fossil fuel power plants (at or above 200 MWe capacity) or building new ones would clash with the EU’s best-case decarbonisation scenarios as set out in the EU’s  Energy Roadmap 2050 , resulting in fossil fuel overcapacity. This hypothetical situation is based on a detailed, unit-by-unit analysis of fossil fuel power capacity in Europe and its potential evolution up to 2030 based on current circumstances and technical lifetime assumptions.   At present, power plant operators tend to prolong the operation of inflexible, carbon-intensive plants. If this trend is sustained while new fossil fuel capacity is added to the system, all fossil fuel power plants would need to curtail their activity to meet the EU’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.   The report argues that a pan-European approach to climate and energy reduces the need for back-up fossil fuel generation capacity at national level. It also calls for an integrated and coherent tracking of progress towards EU climate and energy targets. This includes a regular sharing of information on the evolution of fossil fuel capacity and information on expected carbon-intensity levels over the short and medium term, to improve consistency in national and European decarbonisation efforts. It also suggests that an increased alignment of energy, climate and environmental policies can maximise benefits and speed up the transition to a secure, sustainable and competitive EU power sector.

"electric-vehicles-and-energy  Electric vehicles and the energy sector - impacts on Europe's future emissions  A fundamental change within the road transport sector is required if Europe wants to achieve its objective of a long-term transition to a low-carbon European economy. Electric vehicles charged with electricity from renewable sources can reduce future emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants from road transport. This briefing (based on an assessment carried out on behalf of the EEA) presents the key implications for emissions and Europe's energy system arising from the potential wide-scale use of electric cars in 2050.   air transport emissions electric cars      The need for sustainable road transport   Despite previous technological improvements, the transport sector contributes around one quarter of Europes GHG emissions, thereby contributing to climate change. Emissions from road vehicles also contribute to high concentrations of air pollutants in many European cities, which often don't meet  air quality standards set by the EU  and the  World Health Organization (WHO).    The potential of renewable energy sources to power electric vehicles can contribute to a considerable decarbonisation of the future road transport sector and improved resource efficiency. It also has associated co-benefits in terms of reduced air pollution. However, the extent to which this may occur varies greatly by country, in terms of how the demand for additional electricity for electric vehicles can be accommodated.     Approach  The assessment commissioned by the EEA explored the future impacts of greater electric vehicle use upon the EU-28's energy system, and associated emissions from the road transport and energy sectors. Two scenarios were explored:  1. the share of electric vehicles as part of the entire EU-28 car fleet in 2050 was assumed to be 50% (on average);  2. the share of electric vehicles in 2050 was assumed to be 80%.  The resulting changes in energy demand and CO 2  and selected air pollutant emissions were quantified. They were then compared with a European Commission 'reference' projection, which assumes that only 8% of Europe's car fleet would be electric in 2050. Other sectors and their potential future reductions in energy demand were not taken into account.         Increased electricity demand   Additional electricity generation will be required in the European Union to meet the extra energy demand arising from an 80% share of electric vehicles in 2050. The share of Europe's total electricity consumption from electric vehicles will increase from approximately 0.03% in 2014 to around 4-5% by 2030 and 9.5% by 2050.   The additional electricity demand due to the high rates of electric vehicle ownership assumed for the future will need to be met by additional power generation. Furthermore, this additional energy needs to be integrated into the grid infrastructure across Europe. Critical questions are therefore how much electricity is needed, what type of generation is used to cover this additional electricity demand and how are charging peaks managed?   Until 2030, the additional energy demand by electric vehicles will be limited and will not significantly influence the electricity system. But, in the longer term, with high market shares of electric vehicles assumed in 2050, the required electricity demand will have more significant impact on power systems in Europe.   The share of electricity consumption required by an 80% share of electric vehicles in 2050 will vary between 3% and 25% of total electricity demand across the EU-28 Member States (Figure 1), depending upon the number of electric vehicles anticipated in each country. On average, for the EU-28, the proportion of total electricity demand required in 2050 is 9.5%, compared with the 1.3% assumed in the European Commission's projection. Overall, an additional electrical capacity of 150GW will be needed to charge electric cars.   Figure 1: Electric vehicle energy demand as a percentage of total electricity demand in 2050        Meeting the additional electricity demand     The integration of the additional energy demand caused by electric vehicles poses challenges for the management of power systems at local, national and European levels.    High shares of electric vehicles will require significant additional electricity generation which, in the absence of coordinated investment, may put stress on electricity infrastructure. Even between countries with a similar share of renewable energy, management strategies to accommodate the charging of a large number of electric vehicles can be very different, depending on the types of renewable energy and conventional power generation in each country. In countries with highly fluctuating renewable energy supplies, coordinating the energy demand from electric vehicles may become a major challenge.   It is clear, for example, that countries with high solar energy generation capacity, for which the preferred charging peak will be during the day, will need to apply different grid and power management strategies from countries that have only wind, or combined solar and wind electricity production. In regions with a weak network infrastructure, additional grid reinforcement or implementation of specific 'smart charging' approaches might be required to ensure an efficient and flexible electricity generation and distribution infrastructure.     Impacts on climate and the environment     Increasing the numbers of electric vehicles can significantly reduce direct emissions of CO 2  and air pollutants from road transport. However, these positive effects are partially offset by additional emissions caused by the additional electricity required and continued fossil fuel use in the power sector projection in 2050.    An 80% share of electric vehicles in the 2050 passenger road transport fleet will result in lower emissions of both CO 2  and air pollutants from the road transport sector itself. However, higher emissions would result from the associated fossil fuel combustion in the electricity-generating sector if reductions in electricity demand are not made in other sectors, e.g. by energy efficiency improvements.   Overall, the avoided CO 2  emissions in the road transport sector outweigh the higher emissions from electricity generation. In the EU-28, a net reduction of 255Mt CO 2  could be delivered in 2050 (Figure 2), an amount equivalent to around 10% of the total emissions from all sectors for that year, according to the European Commission projection. In countries with high shares of fossil fuel power plants, electric vehicle demand could, however, lead to higher CO 2  emissions. The environmental benefit of electric vehicles in these instances would therefore not be fully realised.   Figure 2: Future changes in CO 2  emissions in the energy and road transport sectors      For air pollutants, an 80% share of electric vehicles in 2050 will significantly reduce direct exhaust emissions of NO x , PM and SO 2  from road transport, for each pollutant by more than 80% in comparison with 2010 levels. However, as for CO 2 , the overall reduction for NO x  and PM will to some degree be offset by additional emissions coming from the electricity-generating sector  by 1% for NO x  and 3% for PM 10  (particulate matter with a diameter of 10m or less). The situation is different for SO 2 . The already relatively low SO 2  emissions from road transport, coupled with the use of coal in power generation, will result in additional SO 2  emissions, which exceed the reduction made in the road transport sector by a factor of 5. Additional abatement of the higher SO 2  emissions would be required.   The difference in emissions of air pollutants from the road transport sector and electricity generation cannot be compared directly in terms of their respective impacts on human health. Their impact depends to a large degree on the location, intensity and type of emission sources. Emissions from road transport occur at ground level and generally in areas where people live and work, such as in cities and towns, so much of the population is exposed to them. In contrast, power stations are generally outside cities, in less populated areas. As a result of this lower exposure, a shift of emissions from the road transport sector to the power generation sector can therefore be beneficial for health.     Moving towards the future     A large share of electric vehicles on Europe's roads in the future will have implications for the electricity generation and distribution infrastructure. Integrating the additional electricity demand poses diverse challenges. It is important that the road transport and energy sectors become more closely coupled, and that policy and investment decisions across both sectors are closely integrated.   Electric vehicles are just one way in which Europe can move towards a more resource efficient economy and decarbonised transport system. Replacing conventional vehicles with electric vehicles can help reduce emissions, although how much it helps depends significantly upon the source of the electricity used to charge vehicles: renewable, nuclear power or fossil fuel sources. However, simply replacing conventional vehicles will not solve other transport-related problems such as growing congestion and increasing demand for road infrastructure. A systematic transformation is needed, including further development of renewable biofuels, a shift towards non-motorised and/or public transport and changing the ways in which we use our transport systems. This will help achieve the EU's commitment to a more resource efficient, green and competitive low-carbon economy.

Emissions from road vehicles also contribute to high concentrations of air pollutants in many European cities, which often don't meet air quality standards set by the EU and the World Health Organization (WHO). The potential of renewable energy sources to power electric vehicles can contribute to a considerable decarbonisation of the future road transport sector and improved resource efficiency. It also has associated co-benefits in terms of reduced air pollution. However, the extent to which this may occur varies greatly by country, in terms of how the demand for additional electricity for electric vehicles can be accommodated.  ApproachThe assessment commissioned by the EEA explored the future impacts of greater electric vehicle use upon the EU-28's energy system, and associated emissions from the road transport and energy sectors. Two scenarios were explored:1. the share of electric vehicles as part of the entire EU-28 car fleet in 2050 was assumed to be 50% (on average);2. the share of electric vehicles in 2050 was assumed to be 80%.The resulting changes in energy demand and CO2 and selected air pollutant emissions were quantified. They were then compared with a European Commission 'reference' projection, which assumes that only 8% of Europe's car fleet would be electric in 2050. Other sectors and their potential future reductions in energy demand were not taken into account.    Increased electricity demand Additional electricity generation will be required in the European Union to meet the extra energy demand arising from an 80% share of electric vehicles in 2050. The share of Europe's total electricity consumption from electric vehicles will increase from approximately 0.03% in 2014 to around 4-5% by 2030 and 9.5% by 2050. The additional electricity demand due to the high rates of electric vehicle ownership assumed for the future will need to be met by additional power generation. Furthermore, this additional energy needs to be integrated into the grid infrastructure across Europe. Critical questions are therefore how much electricity is needed, what type of generation is used to cover this additional electricity demand and how are charging peaks managed? Until 2030, the additional energy demand by electric vehicles will be limited and will not significantly influence the electricity system. But, in the longer term, with high market shares of electric vehicles assumed in 2050, the required electricity demand will have more significant impact on power systems in Europe. The share of electricity consumption required by an 80% share of electric vehicles in 2050 will vary between 3% and 25% of total electricity demand across the EU-28 Member States (Figure 1), depending upon the number of electric vehicles anticipated in each country. On average, for the EU-28, the proportion of total electricity demand required in 2050 is 9.5%, compared with the 1.3% assumed in the European Commission's projection. Overall, an additional electrical capacity of 150GW will be needed to charge electric cars. Figure 1: Electric vehicle energy demand as a percentage of total electricity demand in 2050   Meeting the additional electricity demand  The integration of the additional energy demand caused by electric vehicles poses challenges for the management of power systems at local, national and European levels.  High shares of electric vehicles will require significant additional electricity generation which, in the absence of coordinated investment, may put stress on electricity infrastructure.

"electric-vehicles-will-help-the  Electric vehicles will help the shift toward EU's green transport future  A large scale roll-out of electric cars on European roads would result in significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions and lower levels of certain air pollutants, according to a European Environment Agency (EEA) assessment released today. However, widespread use of such vehicles would pose challenges for Europe’s power grid in meeting increased electricity demand.   The EEA briefing ' Electric vehicles and the energy sector — impacts on Europe's future emissions ' looks at the impact of different scenarios that take into account the increased use of electric cars and their effect on the European Union's (EU) energy system, and on emissions of greenhouse gases and selected air pollutants.   'Electric vehicles powered by renewable energy sources can play a bridging role in the EU’s plans to move towards a greener, more sustainable transport system, and in meeting its goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80‒95% by 2050. However, larger numbers of electric vehicles will not be enough for the shift to a low-carbon economy. Other problems such as growing demand for transport and congestion remain and need to be addressed as well,' said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director.   Several scenarios were explored, including one model where electric cars have an 80% share of the EU's total car fleet in 2050. Additional electricity generation will be required in the EU to meet the higher energy demand. The need for extra power will be higher if other sectors like industry or households do not follow through on planned energy efficiency improvements. The use of renewable energy in 2050 will also have an effect on the level of emissions from the power-generating sector.   Overall, the resulting carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission reductions in the road transport sector would outweigh the higher emissions caused by the continued use of fossil fuels in the power-generating sector. In the EU, a net reduction of 255 million tonnes of CO 2  could be delivered in 2050. This amount is equivalent to around 10% of the total emissions estimated for that year. However in countries with a high share of fossil power plants, environmental benefits would be lower. This would also lower the benefits of using electric vehicles in these countries.   An 80 % share of electric vehicles would also significantly reduce overall emissions of certain air pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and particulate matter (PM). For other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), emissions could increase due to the continued use of coal in the electricity generation sector.   A larger number of electric cars on the road may pose future challenges for Europe’s power production capacities and put stress on existing power grids. Under the 80% scenario, the share of Europe’s total electricity consumption from electric vehicles would increase from around 0.03% in 2014, to 9.5% by 2050. A more extensive infrastructure providing more public charging points would be key as well as increased power capacity able to handle a larger European car fleet. The assessment stresses that closer coordination between the road transport and energy sectors on policy making and investments will be crucial.   Pros and cons of electric vehicles    Today's briefing is complemented by the publication of a  new EEA guide on electric vehicles in Europe , which provides a non-technical summary of the latest information on electric cars in Europe, including those with hybrid technologies. The guide specifically focuses on the electric passenger cars currently on the market, and describes how they work and the challenges and incentives in place they face in achieving their broader use. Sales and use of electric vehicles are increasing, but they currently only make up 1.2% of total passenger car sales in the EU. Current estimates also show that electric cars only account for 0.15% of Europe's total car fleet.   energy consumption greenhouse gas emissions electricity generation electric vehicles electric cars scenario studies charging capacity carbon emissions clean transport,The EEA briefing 'Electric vehicles and the energy sector — impacts on Europe's future emissions' looks at the impact of different scenarios that take into account the increased use of electric cars and their effect on the European Union's (EU) energy system, and on emissions of greenhouse gases and selected air pollutants.

"europe-reduced-use-of-ozone  Europe reduced use of ozone layer-harming chemicals in 2015   Chemicals which harm the ozone layer continue to be phased out in the European Union. In 2015, consumption of these chemicals reached its lowest level since 2006, partly due to a drop in imports according to a new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA).   The report  'Ozone depleting substances 2015'  has been published by the EEA to coincide with the  International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer .   Stratospheric ozone absorbs most of the sun’s ultraviolet light so it does not reach the surface of the planet, helping prevent skin cancers and other problems such as damage to crops and marine phytoplankton.

"beyond-paris-making-low-carbon  Beyond Paris: making low-carbon economy happen  Last December in Paris, the world set itself an ambitious target: limiting the global average temperature rise well below 2 degrees, while aiming to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. At the G20 summit earlier this month, China and the United States announced their formal commitment to join the Paris agreement. This is a major step forward for the international effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming. Nevertheless, the current reduction commitments made so far by signatory countries are not sufficient to meet this ambitious target.   The European Unions contributions to implementing the Paris target are set out in the EUs energy and climate framework and implemented by a series of measures. On 20 July, the European Commission proposed a new package of measures to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy in Europe, which still needs to be approved by the European Parliament and Council.   The package is one of the concrete steps proposed to achieve the European Unions commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to the 1990 levels. The proposals include binding emission reductions for Member States for the 2021-2030 period and, for the first time, foresee the inclusion of land use and forestry into the EUs 2030 climate and energy framework.   The package would strengthen the EU climate and energy policy framework significantly towards the EUs long-term trajectory towards a competitive, low-carbon economy. It takes a comprehensive look at the emissions from all sectors of the economy: transport, buildings, agriculture, waste, land use and forestry and foresees emission reductions in all the economic sectors. It also builds on the reform of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), proposed in July 2015, covering emissions from industrial and power sectors.   Moreover, emission reductions are foreseen to be facilitated by a number of sector-specific policy initiatives or wider packages, such as the low-emission mobility strategy or the circular economy package.   Designing systemic and coherent approaches   In recent years, many of our reports, including  Europes environment  State and outlook 2015 (SOER) , have repeatedly highlighted the vital importance of systemic approaches. Todays environmental problems, including climate change, involve a high degree of complexity. For example, we cannot improve air quality in Europe without low-carbon transport, better designed cities, enhanced international cooperation to tackle the trans-boundary movement of air pollutants, or a network of green spaces around urban areas. Climate change can also aggravate air pollution. The same is also true for mitigating climate change. We need to address emissions from all economic sectors and understand production and consumption patterns that generate these emissions. With roughly 10% of global emissions currently coming from the EU, it is also clear that emissions reductions in Europe alone will not solve this global problem.   Similarly, our assessments regularly underline the need for consistent and long-term policy objectives. Introducing fundamental changes to key systems can take decades. Building a clean and low-carbon mobility or energy system requires substantial investments in infrastructure and research on clean technologies. Inconsistent policies without clear objectives are likely to hamper investments in innovative solutions.   Measures, investments and knowledge   Against the backdrop of this EU policy framework and encouraging signs from the worlds largest greenhouse gas emitters, the challenges ahead can be grouped into three clusters.   The first cluster consists of knowledge inputs. Sound policy decisions depend on evidence-based knowledge of past trends and future projections. In this transition, it has become clear that we will increasingly need forward-looking knowledge to guide our policy decisions. In this context, the EEA aims to provide further clarity to environmental complexity.   Second, there are the challenges linked to interventions and measures. The EU policy framework needs to be translated into concrete initiatives and actions on the ground by public authorities at all levels in EU Member States. This requires policy coherence and long-term goals similar to the European one. A full implementation with national policies and measures in Member States is essential.   Third, the challenges around investments imply that a transition to a low-carbon economy cannot be achieved by public investments alone. Private investments also need to be mobilised for clean infrastructure projects and research in clean technologies.   At COP21 in Paris, economic and civil society actors were instrumental for mobilising negotiators towards the more ambitious target of 1.5 degrees. They will also have a key role to play in implementing measures, channelling investments and contributing to the knowledge we need.

This requires policy coherence and long-term goals similar to the European one. A full implementation with national policies and measures in Member States is essential. Third, the challenges around investments imply that a transition to a low-carbon economy cannot be achieved by public investments alone. Private investments also need to be mobilised for clean infrastructure projects and research in clean technologies. At COP21 in Paris, economic and civil society actors were instrumental for mobilising negotiators towards the more ambitious target of 1.5 degrees. They will also have a key role to play in implementing measures, channelling investments and contributing to the knowledge we need.

"electric-vehicles-moving-towards-a  Electric vehicles: moving towards a sustainable mobility system  Modern society depends on the movement of goods and people, but our current transport systems have negative impacts on human health and the environment. We spoke to Magdalena Jóźwicka, project manager of an upcoming report on electric vehicles, about the environmental advantages and challenges of using electricity as an alternative to conventional fuels for vehicles.   What types of electric vehicles are used around Europe nowadays?   There are a number of different types these days. When we talk about passenger vehicles we can distinguish between pure battery electric vehicles – powered by an electric motor only – as well as different types of plug-in hybrid cars that have both an electric motor and an internal combustion engine.   Other types of vehicles can also run on electricity. On the road we see more and more electric bicycles, vans and buses being used. As for other modes of transport we also have railway engines, water-borne ferries, ships and small boats.   How common are electric vehicles across Europe?   Each year we see more and more electric passenger cars being sold, both pure battery vehicles and plug-in hybrids. Last year, around 150 000 new electric vehicles were sold in the EU. Although sales are increasing rapidly in percentage terms, they still constitute a small fraction of overall sales, just 1.2 % in 2015. And we estimate that only around 0.15 % of vehicles on the road are electric. Or put in another way, just one out of every 700 passenger cars. One important country to mention is Norway, which leads the way in terms of electric car sales. Last year, around 34 000 new electric vehicles were sold there – corresponding to one in five of all new cars.   What is the European policy on electric vehicles?   The EU is committed to decarbonising its transport system and supporting alternatives to conventional combustion engine technologies and fuels. Electric vehicles are just one element. Some policies encourage the development of renewable fuels and electricity; while others aim at the infrastructure needed for electric vehicles such as recharging points across Europe. Specific pieces of legislation set targets for how much carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) new vehicles can emit per kilometre. These have helped incentivise manufacture of low emitting vehicles including electric cars.   Why is it important to incorporate electric vehicles in the car fleet?   Use of fossil fuels in transport harms the local air quality and our climate. This happens through exhaust emissions of CO 2  and harmful air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter.  Road traffic is also by far the main source of noise across Europe. Clearly, incorporating electric vehicles in the fleet can significantly reduce overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollution, particularly if the electricity used comes from renewable sources. But even when electricity is generated from fossil fuels, the urban environment can still benefit from a switch to electric vehicles when considering reduced local air pollution and noise levels.   Why are electric vehicles more widespread in some countries than others?   Almost all countries are doing something to promote electric vehicles, but relatively few countries have successfully achieved large increases in sales. For example, ninety percent of new electric vehicles were sold in just six EU Member States in 2015 – that is Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.  Norway, mentioned earlier, is a frontrunner in this field and a good example of a country that uses a complete package of incentives. One of the most effective measures seems to be purchase subsidies that make the price of electric vehicles similar to conventional cars. Other incentives include reduced cost of ownership such as annual tax reduction or free charging, free parking or use of bus lanes for electric cars.     What challenges lie ahead?   The technology still needs to improve in several ways for consumers to embrace electromobility more broadly.  For example, the driving range needs to be longer and the charging speed quicker. Currently, it takes 20-30 minutes to charge a vehicle for a 100 km drive at the fastest charging stations. We also need a better infrastructure making public charging points as common as conventional fuelling stations and expand renewable energy generation capacity to fully take advantage of the benefits of electromobility. Electric vehicles are also more expensive than conventional vehicles.   It is also important to note that simply replacing conventional vehicles with electric ones won’t solve many of the problems we associate with transport. While it can help reduce GHG emissions, air pollution and noise, electric vehicles won’t solve other problems such as congestion or demand for new road infrastructure and parking spaces. To make transport truly sustainable, we as a society need to rethink our whole mobility system looking at innovative ways of reducing our reliance on vehicles. This can include changes such as using car sharing schemes, developing better public transport infrastructure and increasing the use of low- or zero-emission transport modes.   What does the EEA do on electric vehicles?   Looking ahead, we will publish two publications on electric vehicles this autumn: a guide summarising the current state of knowledge on electric vehicles in Europe, and a short forward-looking briefing on some of the potential impacts on the energy system and the environment associated with a hypothetical large-scale uptake of electric vehicles by 2050.        Magdalena Jóźwicka   noise mobility climate change urban air quality road transport incentives electric vehicles fossil fuels electric cars transport infrastructure passenger cars transport modes transport noise carbon dioxide air  pollution transitions zero-emission,What types of electric vehicles are used around Europe nowadays?

"designing-tax-systems-for-a  Designing tax systems for a green economy transition  Environmental taxes can contribute to a healthier planet and healthier people. They also spur jobs and growth, are easy to administer and difficult to evade. However, meeting EU climate and other environmental policy targets will erode the existing base for these sort of taxes. This and other systemic factors have implications for the design of future tax systems in Europe, according to an EEA report published today.   The report,  Environmental taxation and EU environmental policies  gives an overview of market-based instruments (MBIs), such as taxes, recycling fees, polluter-pays schemes or emissions trading permits, created under EU environmental legislation. It also analyses the current design and application of environmental taxes in  EEA member countries  and considers future prospects.   Energy, carbon and vehicle transport are the areas where environmental taxes are most commonly used and where the largest amount of revenue is generated. The analysis shows that resource and pollution taxes exist in the majority of the Member States and their revenue is limited, but they have a big potential to change behaviour towards circular economy and resource efficiency   The report stresses the value that environmental taxes play in decoupling pollution and resource use from economic development. For example, in Sweden, GDP has grown by 58% between 1990 and 2013 since the introduction of a carbon dioxide tax that contributed to a 23% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions over the same period.   Such taxes also contribute to healthier living and can spur eco-friendly technology and innovations that generate wealth and jobs. These in turn help Europes goal in moving toward a low-carbon and resource-efficient economy and in supporting the EUs policies on growth, competitiveness and jobs and its Europe 2020 strategy aims. Environmental taxes are less distorting towards economic behaviour compared with labour and corporate taxes. They also have lower evasion rates and administrative costs.   Looking ahead, the report considers that improving environmental performance alongside demographic changes poses systemic challenges for policy makers in the field of taxation. New low-emission and low-carbon technologies in the industrial and transport sectors can lead to the erosion of the current tax bases in European countries. For example, the Dutch car registration tax scheme has influenced car buyers to purchase smaller, lower carbon emitting vehicles, which in turn has led to a reduction in tax revenues. Transport fuel tax revenues will also decrease when petrol and diesel sales fall as the EU moves towards its climate policy targets. At the same time, the share of the population that is elderly (> 65) will increase while the level of labour supply (age group 15-64) will decrease in most countries leading to a potential reduction in revenues from labour taxes.   The report recommends considering these and related challenges such as economic competitiveness and distributional implications together when policymakers study the potential for tax-shifting programmes between labour and environmental taxes in the design of resilient, long-term tax systems for a future green economy.   Other key findings     The report identifies 18 binding and 24 non-binding market-based instruments like levies, permits or taxes based on EU environmental legislation currently in force across EEA member countries.   Environmental tax revenue at the EU-28 level increased by 9.5% in real terms between 2002 and 2014 (an average increase of 0.8% per year).   There are differences between EEA member countries in terms of environmental tax revenues. In 2014, Denmark had the highest revenues percentage to GDP (4.1%) followed by Slovenia (3.9%), Croatia (3.9%) and Greece (3.7%).

"assessment  Public awareness   The majority of European Union citizens have heard of the term 'biodiversity', but less than one third know what it means. Additionally, most do not feel informed about biodiversity loss.   However, at least eight out of ten Europeans consider the various effects of biodiversity loss to be serious.   About a quarter of respondents have heard of Natura 2000 network, including 16 % who say they have heard about it but don't know what it is.   attitudes of european citizens biodiversity natura 2000   SEBI SEBI026 026,The results of the latest Special Eurobarometer survey, published in 2015, show that of the 60 % of respondents who have heard of the term 'biodiversity', only half of them also know what it means (Figure 1). Two thirds (66 %) of EU citizens do not feel informed about the loss of biodiversity, with 22 % saying they do not feel informed at all. Overall, at least eight out of ten respondents believe that the decline and possible extinction of animals, plants, natural habitats and ecosystems are all serious problems at national, European and global levels. Pollution and man-made disasters are considered the biggest threats to biodiversity, followed by climate change (TNS, 2015). In 2015, 60 % of EU citizens very much agreed that it is important to halt biodiversity loss because our well-being and quality of life is based upon nature and biodiversity. Almost two thirds of people surveyed say they are making personal efforts to protect biodiversity and nature and half of them would like to do even more. The survey also reveals that most Europeans are unaware of what the EU is doing to save biodiversity: roughly three quarters of Europeans have not heard of the Natura 2000 network (73 %) (Figure 2). Around half of those who have heard about it, do not know what it is.  NOTES Flash Eurobarometer surveys from 2007, 2010 and 2013 were carried out by telephone. However, due to the complexity of the topic and the length of the questionnaire, the 2015 Special Eurobarometer survey was conducted face-to-face. This change of surveying mode makes direct comparison with results from previous surveys methodologically unreliable, while the impact of these changes cannot be easily evaluated. Rather than comparing results obtained with different survey methodologies, the 2015 survey sets the baseline for comparison and the establishment of trends for future Special Eurobarometer surveys on Biodiversity.

"abundance-and-distribution-of-selected-4  Abundance and distribution of selected species   Since 1990, common bird populations have decreased by around 15 % in Europe (27 European countries). The decline of common farmland birds was more pronounced at 34 % in all countries with monitoring schemes - and 31 % in EU Member States - whereas common forest bird populations declined by 12 % over the same period.   Grassland butterflies have shown a significant rate of decline of 30 % between 1990 and 2013 in Europe (21 European countries). In the last 10 years, the rate of loss is slowing down.       biodiversity soer2015 grassland butterflies population trends butterflies birds soer2015 european       SEBI SEBI001 CSI CSI050 001 050,Despite a slow levelling off of the downward trend, populations of all common birds in Europe - including common farmland and forest species (Fig. 1) - have declined since 1990. While the indicator takes 1990 as a starting point, it should be borne in mind, however, that significant losses had already happened before this date. In spite of year-to-year fluctuations, grassland butterfly numbers are declining severely; their populations have decreased by 30 % since 1990, although in the last 10 years there have been some signs of levelling off (Fig. 2). Similarly to birds, the dramatic reductions since 1990 certainly add to population losses before that time, although no structured data series are available.  Birds and butterflies are sensitive to environmental change and can reflect changes in ecosystems as well as in other animals and plants. Trends of their populations can thus be excellent barometers of the health of the environment.  The long-term trends for common farmland and forest birds as well as grassland butterflies demonstrate that Europe has experienced a major decline in biodiversity associated with agro-ecosystems and grasslands. This was primarily due to habitat change  including loss, fragmentation and degradation  of natural and semi-natural ecosystems. The change was mainly caused by homogenisation and loss of habitat as a result of agricultural intensification, intensive forest management, land abandonment and urban sprawl.  The challenge now is to deploy widely the conservation measures of European policies (such as Birds and Habitats Directives and the Water Framework Directive) as well as the environmental measures within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in order to help populations recover at national and European scales.        NOTES An increase in the population index means that there are more species with increased populations than those with decreased populations: it does not necessarily mean that the population of all species has increased. This situation may be due to an expansion of some species (typically, generalists) at the expense of other species (typically, specialists). It must also be noted that populations fluctuate on a yearly basis. In the absence of information on abundance, information on the distribution of species can help assess species status. However, at European level, this type of information is still weak for other groups of species. FURTHER INFORMATION  European Bird Census Council (EBCC): www.ebcc.info.

"assessment  Global and European temperature          According to three different observational records of global average annual near-surface (land and ocean) temperature, the last decade (20062015) was 0.83 to 0.89C warmer than the pre-industrial average, which makes it the warmest decade on record. Of the 16 warmest years on record, 15 have occurred since 2000. The year 2015 was the warmest on record, around 1C warmer than the pre-industrial level, followed by 2014.   The average annual temperature for the European land area for the last decade (20062015) was around 1.5C above the pre-industrial level, which makes it the warmest decade on record. Moreover, 2014 and 2015 were jointly the warmest years in Europe since instrumental records began.   Climate models project further increases in global average temperature over the 21st century (for the period 20812100 relative to 19862005) of between 0.3 and 1.7C for the lowest emissions scenario (RCP2.6) and between 2.6 and 4.8C for the highest emissions scenario (RCP8.5).   All UNFCCC member countries have agreed on the long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2C compared with pre-industrial levels and have agreed to aim to limit the increase to 1.5C. For the three highest of the four RCPs, global average temperature increase is projected to exceed 2C compared with pre-industrial levels by 2050.   Annual average land temperature over Europe is projected to increase by the end of this century (20712100 relative to 19712000) in the range of 1 to 4.5C under RCP4.5 and 2.5 to 5.5C under RCP8.5, which is more than the projected global average increase. The strongest warming is projected across north-eastern Europe and Scandinavia in winter and southern Europe in summer.   The number of warm days (those exceeding the 90th percentile threshold of a baseline period) have almost doubled since 1960 across the European land area.   Europe has experienced several extreme heat waves since 2000 (2003, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2014 and 2015). Under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), very extreme heat waves as strong as these or even stronger are projected to occur as often as every two years in the second half of the 21st century. The impacts will be particularly strong in southern Europe.       heat waves climate temperature surface temperature climate change air temperature global warming scenarios anomalies key climate variables          CSI CSI012 CLIM CLIM001 012 001,Heat extremes in Europe Past trends Observational data show a continued increase in heat extremes over land in the period 19972012) [vi]. At the global scale, warm days and nights, as well as heat waves, have become more frequent in recent decades. The increase in maximum daily temperatures has generally been faster than the increase in annual average temperature [vii]. In Europe, since the 1950s, large areas have experienced intense and long heat waves, with notable impacts on human health and socio-economic systems [viii]. As a result, 500-year-old temperature records were broken over 65% of Europe in the period 20032010 alone [ix]. Indices for extreme temperatures, including the annual maximum value of daily maximum temperature (Txx), have shown significant upwards trends across Europe since the 1950s [x]. The number of unusually warm days (Tx90p) has increased by up to 10 days per decade since 1960 in most of southern Europe and Scandinavia (Figure 5). Based on the daily Heat Wave Magnitude Index (HWMId), Europe has experienced 11 intense and long heat waves between 1950 and 2015, most of which occurred after 2000 (in 2003, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2014 and 2015) [xi]. The most severe heat waves have been characterised by the persistence of extremely high night-time temperatures [xii]. A substantial fraction of the probability of recent extreme events can be attributed to human-induced climate change, and it is likely that, for temperature extremes occurring over previous decades, a fraction of their probability was attributable to anthropogenic influences [xiii]. Projections Periods with extreme high temperatures are projected to become more frequent and to last longer across Europe during this century [xiv]. Projections based on a multi-model ensemble agree on increases in heat wave frequency and magnitude for most European regions during the 21st century under all RCP scenarios. Extreme summer heat waves, such as the ones experienced in different parts of Europe in 2003 and 2010, will become much more common in the future. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, very extreme heat waves([xv]) (much stronger than either the 2003 or the 2010 heat waves) are projected to occur as often as every two years in the second half of the 21st century (Figure 6). The projected frequency of heat waves is greatest in southern and south-eastern Europe [xvi]. According to a different analysis, at the end of the 21st century, 90% of the summers in southern, central and north-western Europe will be warmer than any summer in the period 19202014 under the RCP8.5 scenario [xvii]. The most severe health risks are projected for low-altitude river basins in southern Europe and for the Mediterranean coasts, where many densely populated urban centres are located [xviii].

The grey shading shows the 95% confidence interval, which reflects uncertainties owing to areas without observation stations, inhomogeneities in measurements and biases as a result of urbanisation [i]. The years 2014 and 2015 were jointly the warmest calendar years in Europe since instrumental records began, and anthropogenic climate change made these record temperatures 3580 times more likely [ii]. Moreover, climate reconstructions show that summer temperatures in Europe in the last three decades (19862015) have been the warmest for at least 2000years, and that they lie significantly outside the range of natural variability [iii]. Based on the E-OBS dataset, all of Europe has warmed significantly since the 1960s [iv]. Particularly large warming has been observed over the Iberian Peninsula, mostly in summer, across central and north-eastern Europe, and in mountainous regions (Figure 3)., warming since the 1960s has been strongest and significant over Scandinavia, especially in winter,. Projections Temperatures across Europe are projected to continue increasing throughout this century. Projections from the EURO-CORDEX initiative suggest that European land areas will warm faster on average than global land areas [v]. According to the multi-model ensemble mean, European land areas are projected to warm in the range of 1 to 4.5C for the RCP4.5 scenario and in the range of 2.5 to 5.5C for RCP8.5 over the 21st century (20712100 compared with 19712000) (Figure 4). The strongest warming is projected over north-eastern Europe and Scandinavia in winter and over southern Europe in summer.

Three independent analyses of global average temperature using near-surface observation records  HadCRUT4 [i], NOAA Global Temp [ii] and GISTEMP by the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (Hansen et al., 2010; GISTEMP team, 2016)  show similar amounts of warming. They show warming compared with pre-industrial temperatures (using the earliest observations from the period 18501900 as a proxy) of between 0.83 and 0.89C for the decade 20062015 (Figure 1). This magnitude of warming corresponds to almost half of the 2C warming that is compatible with the global climate stabilisation target of the EU and the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC [iii]. Similar estimations of warming have also been obtained through climate reanalysis. The year 2015 was the warmest on record according to different near-surface temperature observational analyses, with temperatures around 1C above pre-industrial levels [iv]. The year 2014 was the second warmest on record. Note that such statements are always associated with some uncertainty, primarily because of spatial and temporal gaps in the data record and different interpolation methods [v]. Furthermore, the annual temperature anomalies are also strongly influenced by climate variability due to natural forcings (volcanic eruptions and solar activity) and by internal variability within the climate system (e.g. multi-annual climate fluctuations such as the ENSO, which influence the rate of heat uptake by the oceans) [vi]. Global ocean heat content has been increasing continuously since the 1950s up to at least 2000m, without showing any slow-down. Furthermore, a recent study that uses new datasets of the sea surface temperature and more sophisticated interpolation methods for data-sparse regions such as the Arctic suggests that the increase in global average temperature since 1998 was higher than the increase in the observed near-surface temperature as used for the IPCCAR5 [vii]. Changing the start and end years also has an effect on the rate of change, but this is less than the impact of newly available data and methods for interpolation [viii]. Projections The global average temperature will continue to increase throughout this century as a result of projected further increases in greenhouse gas concentrations. The CMIP5 climate projections summarised in the IPCCAR5 project that global temperature will increase by mid-century (20462065 relative to 19862005) by 0.41.6C for RCP2.6, 0.92.0C for RCP4.5, 0.81.8C for RCP6.0 and 1.42.6C for RCP8.5; the warming projections for the end of the century (20812100) are 0.31.7C for RCP2.6, 1.12.6C for RCP4.5, 1.43.1C for RCP6.0 and 2.64.8C for RCP8.5. All projections show greater warming over land than over the oceans. Projected warming is strongest in the Arctic at about twice the global average. These patterns are consistent with the observations during the latter part of the 20th century [ix]. The UNFCCC target of limiting global average warming to less than 2.0C above pre-industrial levels is projected to be exceeded between 2042 and 2050 by the three highest of the four RCP scenarios [x]. The lowest, RCP2.6, implies a strong reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over this century and negligible or even negative emissions at the end of the century [xi]. Several studies have projected climate change beyond 2100 based on the so-called extended concentration pathways (ECPs). The central estimates (i.e. average across models) for global mean temperature increase by 2200, relative to pre-industrial levels, are between 1.3C for ECP2.6 and 7.1C for ECP8.5 [xii].

"air-pollution-from-agriculture-eu  Air pollution from agriculture: EU exceeds international limit in 2014  Ammonia emissions in Europe have fallen since 1990, but by not as much as emissions of other air pollutants tracked under an internationally agreed United Nations convention. According to a new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA), ammonia emissions increased in 2014, meaning several EU Member States as well as the EU now exceed their respective ammonia emission limits under the convention.   Around 94% of ammonia (NH 3 ) emissions in Europe stem from agriculture, mainly from activities such as manure storage, slurry spreading and the use of fertilisers containing nitrogen. Ammonia contributes to eutrophication — an oversupply of nitrogen — and acidification of ecosystems. It also forms particulate matter in the atmosphere which harms human health.   The  Gothenburg Protocol  to the UNECE  Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP)  contains emission reduction commitments that have to be met from 2010 onwards for NH 3  and three other air pollutants: nitrogen oxides (NO x ), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), and sulphur oxides (SO x ). In addition to emission reduction commitments specified for individual countries, the protocol also specifies reduction commitments for the EU-15.   The annual  European Union emission inventory report 1990-2014  under the LRTAP Convention shows that NH 3  emissions fell by 24% between 1990 and 2014, but increased in the EU‑28 between 2013 and 2014 by 0.9%. Ammonia emissions from the EU-15 in 2014 were 0.2% higher than the 2010 limit, the first time the EU-15 has exceeded its emission ceiling for this pollutant.   The rise in NH 3  emissions in 2014 was mainly due to increases in France, Germany and Spain. Four countries (Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain) also exceeded their individual NH 3  ceilings in 2014. (see Figure ES.5). More generally, some countries have also recently improved their estimates of NH 3  released from agricultural sources which in some instances has led to an increase in the emissions reported from past years. Better reporting by Member States, including the reporting of new emissions sources, is encouraged.                    Emissions of the other main pollutants covered by LRTAP have dropped considerably since 1990, including the three air pollutants primarily responsible for the formation of ground-level ozone (O 3 ). Carbon monoxide (CO), NMVOCs and NO x  were reduced by 65%, 60% and 55%, respectively.   Other key findings     Across the EU-28, SO x  emissions have fallen the most with an 88% reduction since 1990. This is a result of a combination of measures including a shift from fuels with high sulphur content towards low-sulphur fuels such as natural gas, flue-gas desulphurisation in industrial facilities and EU directives relating to the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels.   Emissions of primary particulate matter PM 10  and PM 2.5  have fallen by 23% and 25%, respectively since 2000, and black carbon (BC) by 42%.       Emissions of heavy metals such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg), as well as the organic pollutants dioxins and furans, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have also dropped substantially since 1990, by about 66 % or more.    The EEA member countries Norway and Switzerland, also have emission ceilings specified under the Gothenburg Protocol. In 2014, Norway exceeded its NH  3   ceiling. Switzerland complied with all its ceilings.      Background   The Gothenburg Protocol to the LRTAP Convention aims to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution. It sets emission ‘ceilings’ or limits for a range of air pollutants that have to be met from 2010 onwards. In addition to ceilings specified for individual countries, the 1999 protocol also specifies ceilings for the EU-15. The protocol was amended in 2012 with new emission reduction commitments for 2020 and beyond. The EU-28 has not yet ratified the amended protocol.   Parties to the protocol are allowed to ‘adjust’ their emission estimates to take into account certain changes that have occurred since the emission reduction commitments were originally agreed (for instance, the reporting of emission sources that were unknown at the time the reduction commitments were agreed). For comparisons against the protocol ceilings for 2010, the EEA has taken into account the approved adjusted emission inventory data reported by Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany Luxembourg and Spain.   The EEA assists the EU by preparing the emissions inventory to be reported under the LRTAP Convention each year.   LRTAP data viewer   The EEA publishes the data from the inventory report in the  LRTAP data viewer , a web-based interactive interface from where air pollutant emissions data can be downloaded. The data viewer also displays emission trends and graphics for the main sectors and allows for comparison of emissions from different countries and activities.       air pollutant emissions eutrophication fertiliser air pollutant emissions data viewer lrtap lrtap convention heavy metals gothenburg protocol ammonia manure particulate matter sulphur oxides black carbon carbon monoxide acidification emission ceilings nitrogen oxides,Around 94% of ammonia (NH3) emissions in Europe stem from agriculture, mainly from activities such as manure storage, slurry spreading and the use of fertilisers containing nitrogen.

"building-resilient-cities-key-to  Building resilient cities key to tackling effects of climate change  Cities across Europe must step up their adaptation efforts if they are to handle the increasingly complex challenges caused by climate change such as more extreme flooding or prolonged heatwaves. A European Environment Agency (EEA) report published today stresses the benefits of investing in long-term preventive measures that cities should take to improve their resilience.   The EEA report  ‘Urban adaptation to climate change in Europe 2016 – transforming cities in a changing climate’  provides an in-depth overview of actions that urban planners and policymakers can take to help lessen the impact of climate change. The report outlines the changes and socio-economic challenges cities face due to climate change, and the possible consequences. It analyses the approaches cities can take to adaptation and explains that short-term coping or incremental adaptation measures alone will not be enough to mitigate the threats.   The report recommends that the best way to meet these challenges is to take a wider systemic approach that addresses the root causes of vulnerability to climate change. This includes better urban planning, with more green areas that can retain excess rainwater or cool built-up city cores in the summer, or by preventing the construction of houses in flood-prone areas. This approach can transform cities into much more attractive, climate-resilient and sustainable places.   European cities are increasingly susceptible to the negative aspects of climate change, which are expected to increase in frequency and intensity with extreme events such as heatwaves, flooding, water scarcity and droughts. At the same time, socio-economic and demographic developments can make cities more vulnerable. These will have profound impacts on a wide range of city functions, infrastructure and services such as energy, transport, and water and will affect the quality of life.   According to the report, 100 cities, including Copenhagen, Rotterdam, Barcelona, Bologna and Bratislava, have already started to look at their vulnerability to climate change. They have developed plans and strategies and started implementing them. Governments and organisations at EU, national and regional levels have also developed political and legislative frameworks for cities to implement adaptation measures – among them the  EU Adaptation Strategy  and the  Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy initiative .  However, more needs to be done, as many more cities are not yet planning for climate change, the report says.         Background   The report targets local, regional, national and European governments and organisations as well as experts and researchers concerned with urban adaptation. It complements other Agency products such as the  EEA report 2/2012: Urban adaptation to Climate change in Europe – Challenges and Opportunities  and the  interactive map book on urban vulnerability to climate change .   The EEA’s task is to provide knowledge for this process at different levels.

"green-choices-policy-makers-investors  Green choices: policymakers, investors and consumers…  From walking and electric cars to massive freight vessels and high speed trains, a wide range of transport options exist. Many factors, including price, distance, availability of infrastructure and convenience, can play a role when selecting a transport mode. Car rides are the preferred mode for passenger transport in Europe. But even then, some options are cleaner than others. How can we opt for greener choices?   The transport sector provides an essential service to today’s society, contributing significantly to quality of life. In some cases, transport meets a vital need such as food distribution, commuting to work or going to school. In other cases, it facilitates leisure time. Depending on the transport mode selected, the journey might generate varying impacts on the environment and human health. In many cases, we have a choice.   Consider a commute of 5 kilometres. There might be several options available: ride our bicycle, drive alone in our diesel SUV (sport utility vehicle), carpool with co-workers or take public transport. Some of the options will always be more environment friendly than others. At the same time, not all options will be available to everyone. For example, a very rough terrain without bicycle paths on a stormy day will only appeal to adventurous cyclists in good form. Similarly, car-pooling in an electric car is more likely to happen when certain conditions are met, such as the availability of re-charging stations and a community of car-poolers.   The transport sector involves a wide range of stakeholders from urban planners and vehicle manufacturers to passengers. To facilitate the transition towards a green and sustainable transport system, they all need to be involved and unafraid to question every aspect of the current transport system. Some of these questions might actually force us to reconsider our consumption patterns and lifestyle choices — what we consider as essential and what is just nice-to-have.   European support for carbon-free transport   At the moment, transport in Europe remains very dependent on oil, with an increasing number of new passenger cars sold, the majority of which use diesel. Europe’s goal is to move away from this reliance on fossil fuels.   The future of Europe’s transport sector is shaped by a number of EU policy documents, including the Europe 2020 strategy, the Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050 and the Roadmap to a single European transport area — towards a competitive and resource-efficient transport system (referred as the 2011 Transport White Paper).   They clearly identify the challenges the transport sector faces: developing a competitive transport system, reducing Europe’s dependence on imported oil and reducing carbon emissions from transport by 60 % by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels), while supporting growth and employment.   The EU has earmarked funds to this end. More precisely, close to 20 % of the EU’s Cohesion Policy funds (around EUR 70 billion over the period 2014–2020) is expected to support transport investments. More than half of this amount will support the transition towards an energy-efficient, decarbonised transport sector.   To drive or not to drive?   Although Europeans across Member States and age groups prefer a wide range of transport modes, cars appear to be the most popular option. According to a  Eurobarometer survey  on urban mobility, half of Europeans use a car every day as a driver or a passenger. However, car use varies significantly across EU countries. While eight out of ten survey respondents in Cyprus use a car every day, less than a quarter do so in Hungary.   The daily use of public transport is quite high in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Latvia. In Cyprus, three quarters of respondents never take public transport. The Netherlands, Denmark and Finland have very high cycling rates with 43 %, 30 % and 28 %, respectively, of respondents cycling every day.   It is not surprising that in the countries with a high rate of daily car use, public transport and bicycles are used less often. It is also not surprising that Europeans aged 15‒24 are by far the most likely group to use public transport at least once a day.   So the question is how to encourage Europeans to opt for greener transport modes.         Future of passenger cars: shared and electric?   Cleaner fuels and higher fuel efficiency can help reduce the environmental and health impacts of transport to some degree. EU and national funds have long supported research into alternative fuels, leading to many improvements in fuel efficiency and engines. However, common standards and an extensive fuelling infrastructure also need to be developed to encourage a wider uptake of cleaner fuels. Car buyers/users are more likely to choose alternative-fuel vehicles when they feel confident that they can easily recharge or fuel their car without the risk of running out of fuel on the road.   To facilitate the build-up of infrastructure (e.g. recharging points across Europe) and common technical specifications (e.g. a common plug standard for recharging), the EU has set out a comprehensive alternative fuels strategy covering all modes of transport in its communication on ‘ Clean Power for Transport ’.   Depending on the distances to be covered, a large vessel has a very different energy need than a compact electric car designed for short trips in the city centre. Given these differences, it is clear that a comprehensive mix of alternative fuels is needed.   The development of the alternative-fuels market, including investments in their infrastructure, is also expected to boost the economy and create new jobs. According to research by the European Climate Foundation, greening cars could create 700 000 extra jobs in the EU by 2025. Moreover, the alternative fuels market could also significantly reduce the EU’s dependence on oil and thus the economic risks linked to fluctuations in supply.   Renewing existing fleets with more efficient models will take time. Given their longer lifespan, replacing aircraft, train and ship fleets, will take more time than for cars and trucks. For passenger cars, car-sharing schemes could actually offer an interesting alternative to the ‘one household-one car’ model, especially for urban residents, and speed up the renewal of the fleet. Car-sharing could also mean savings for the user as the costs of owning a car (purchase, maintenance, insurance, etc.) would be shared by a group of users. It could also reduce the number of cars parked in cities. What used to be a symbol of social status — car ownership — should no longer be perceived as such.   Higher taxes for the more polluting transport modes?   Pricing can provide another push for the user towards greener transport. Taxes applied to more polluting transport modes make them more expensive and are likely to reduce the demand. The opposite is valid for cleaner options: reducing taxes can lure more users to cleaner transport. More than half of Europeans believe that lower prices and better public transport are the best ways to improve urban travel.   Road transport fuel is already heavily taxed across the EU compared to other transport modes. Nevertheless, different types of road fuels are taxed at different rates, influencing the composition of the vehicle fleet. For example, lower taxes and other incentives on diesel in many EU countries resulted in a significant increase in the number of diesel vehicles sold. Although diesel vehicles might have helped lower GHG emissions, their indirect promotion and growing uptake have contributed to air pollution in Europe.   Subsidies and tax breaks are common in the transport sector. Some promote greener options, such as public transport, while others, such as preferential tax treatment of company cars or tax exemptions on the fuel used for international plane and ship travel, result in higher car use or increased consumption of fossil fuels. The overall influence could again be significant. For example, in Germany, Europe’s biggest market for cars, around 64 % of all new cars were registered to companies in 2014.   The high uptake of electric cars in the Netherlands and Norway has been closely linked to a number of incentives offered to potential buyers. However, consumers can easily revert back to combustion-engine cars when such incentives are discontinued. Tax rules for plug-in hybrid and hybrid cars were changed in the Netherlands, effective as of 1 January 2016. This change resulted in a huge and immediate drop in  electric car sales . Similar consumer reactions were also observed in other countries, including Denmark.   Making the user pay for infrastructure   Charging for infrastructure use is another effective tool for influencing the price of transport and, hence, the demand. There are different ways to charge for road infrastructure in Europe. Tolls often consist of a price paid for the distance travelled, whereas vignettes allow the vehicle to use a country’s road infrastructure for a given period of time.   In 2015, 27 of the EEA’s member countries had some type of road charge for heavy-duty vehicles (e.g. trucks and buses). The EU’s Eurovignette Directive foresees road-user charges for such vehicles. Regional and national authorities can improve infrastructure charging through a further shift from vignettes to electronic tolls. A wider and more systematic use of fair and efficient tolls based on the polluter/user pays principle will steer users towards more sustainable transport choices.   Public authorities also play a key role in ensuring that different transport systems are connected (e.g. rail to air) and interoperable (e.g. no need to buy separate tickets), and that price signals are consistent. Through their regulatory and funding power, public authorities also help shape the mobility system of the future. For example, they could make sure that decarbonisation and climate adaptation concerns are always taken into account in all infrastructure plans. Public authorities can also facilitate cooperation among different stakeholders, enhancing exchange of know-how and innovative ideas, as well as helping different operators prepare for and cope with climate change impacts. Greater interoperability between European railway services could provide an opportunity to channel larger volumes of freight towards this more environment-friendly mode.   Transport is a complex sector with many different public and private sector stakeholders such as infrastructure and service providers across different modes, vehicle producers, regulators and, finally, users. Many stakeholders only have a partial perspective of the system. Moreover, transport requires many costly and long-lasting investments in infrastructure, aircraft, trains, ships and other transport equipment. A large part of these investments comes from public funds.   Decarbonisation of the transport sector will affect all Europeans and the whole economy. The energy sector in the EU will need to adapt to changes in demand. For example, increased use of electric vehicles will generate extra demand for electricity. In addition, decarbonisation of the transport sector is expected to impact the oil-refining sector, while offering new opportunities in alternative fuels. It can also boost Europe’s competitiveness by enabling European manufacturers to develop and export cutting-edge transport technology.   Smart and innovative mobility   A part of the demand for mobility stems from lifestyle and habits. With rising income levels, more and more Europeans travel to different parts of the world for work and leisure. Air travel, which used to be a memorable experience enjoyed by few people just 50 years ago, has become quite ordinary. The same goes for car ownership, even if that means a private car spends most of its time unused. Consumption patterns have continuously evolved and will continue to change. New holiday destinations such as the Arctic might appear on the tourism menu as a result of climate change. We may, however, decide to opt for greener choices.   Innovative solutions can actually challenge some of these consumption patterns while still meeting the need for mobility. Innovation does not involve engine designs and energy efficiency only, but also covers new business and ownership models. In a world of highly packaged tours, businesses can explore eco-tourism alternatives, such as cycling-camping vacations across Europe, for example.   A network of cycle paths is more likely to convince commuters and leisure drivers to cycle. Some EU countries are already introducing bicycle networks that go beyond urban centres. Germany has recently opened the first stretch of what will become a 100 km cycle ‘autobahn’, connecting 10 cities and four universities in the Ruhr region. The cycle-highway will be completely traffic-free and will mainly use converted disused rail tracks. According to some estimates, the  cycle highway  is expected to reduce traffic load in the area by up to 50 000 cars every day when completed.   Innovation could also help improve freight logistics and road transport in general. Many trucks are not fully loaded on their return journeys, so improving operational logistics could reduce the number of ‘empty runs’ and consequently the number of trucks on the road. A fleet of  self-driving trucks  has just driven 2000 km across Europe. Self-driving cars might also be in the pipeline. By regulating speed, they are expected to reduce fuel consumption. They can also enhance the mobility needs of some social groups, such as children and the elderly. Smart transport systems could be built to prevent accidents, and reduce fuel consumption and congestion.   Smart mobility can combine different modes and options (public transport, car-sharing, car rental services, taxis and a bicycle system) to cater for mobility needs by using IT, apps, and smart invoicing.   Innovation and research will certainly be one of the driving forces behind the transition towards smarter and cleaner mobility. So what should we explore next — solar powered tricycles, sails and solar panels on vessels, or first-aid assistance through drones?    public transport transport modes mobility transport infrastructure urban,The transport sector provides an essential service to today’s society, contributing significantly to quality of life. In some cases, transport meets a vital need such as food distribution, commuting to work or going to school. In other cases, it facilitates leisure time. Depending on the transport mode selected, the journey might generate varying impacts on the environment and human health. In many cases, we have a choice. Consider a commute of 5 kilometres. There might be several options available: ride our bicycle, drive alone in our diesel SUV (sport utility vehicle), carpool with co-workers or take public transport. Some of the options will always be more environment friendly than others. At the same time, not all options will be available to everyone. For example, a very rough terrain without bicycle paths on a stormy day will only appeal to adventurous cyclists in good form. Similarly, car-pooling in an electric car is more likely to happen when certain conditions are met, such as the availability of re-charging stations and a community of car-poolers. The transport sector involves a wide range of stakeholders from urban planners and vehicle manufacturers to passengers. To facilitate the transition towards a green and sustainable transport system, they all need to be involved and unafraid to question every aspect of the current transport system. Some of these questions might actually force us to reconsider our consumption patterns and lifestyle choices — what we consider as essential and what is just nice-to-have. European support for carbon-free transport At the moment, transport in Europe remains very dependent on oil, with an increasing number of new passenger cars sold, the majority of which use diesel. Europe’s goal is to move away from this reliance on fossil fuels. The future of Europe’s transport sector is shaped by a number of EU policy documents, including the Europe 2020 strategy, the Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050 and the Roadmap to a single European transport area — towards a competitive and resource-efficient transport system (referred as the 2011 Transport White Paper). They clearly identify the challenges the transport sector faces: developing a competitive transport system, reducing Europe’s dependence on imported oil and reducing carbon emissions from transport by 60 % by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels), while supporting growth and employment. The EU has earmarked funds to this end. More precisely, close to 20 % of the EU’s Cohesion Policy funds (around EUR 70 billion over the period 2014–2020) is expected to support transport investments. More than half of this amount will support the transition towards an energy-efficient, decarbonised transport sector. To drive or not to drive? Although Europeans across Member States and age groups prefer a wide range of transport modes, cars appear to be the most popular option. According to a Eurobarometer survey on urban mobility, half of Europeans use a car every day as a driver or a passenger. However, car use varies significantly across EU countries. While eight out of ten survey respondents in Cyprus use a car every day, less than a quarter do so in Hungary. The daily use of public transport is quite high in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Latvia. In Cyprus, three quarters of respondents never take public transport. The Netherlands, Denmark and Finland have very high cycling rates with 43 %, 30 % and 28 %, respectively, of respondents cycling every day. It is not surprising that in the countries with a high rate of daily car use, public transport and bicycles are used less often. It is also not surprising that Europeans aged 15‒24 are by far the most likely group to use public transport at least once a day. So the question is how to encourage Europeans to opt for greener transport modes.  Future of passenger cars: shared and electric? Cleaner fuels and higher fuel efficiency can help reduce the environmental and health impacts of transport to some degree. EU and national funds have long supported research into alternative fuels, leading to many improvements in fuel efficiency and engines. However, common standards and an extensive fuelling infrastructure also need to be developed to encourage a wider uptake of cleaner fuels. Car buyers/users are more likely to choose alternative-fuel vehicles when they feel confident that they can easily recharge or fuel their car without the risk of running out of fuel on the road. To facilitate the build-up of infrastructure (e.g. recharging points across Europe) and common technical specifications (e.g. a common plug standard for recharging), the EU has set out a comprehensive alternative fuels strategy covering all modes of transport in its communication on ‘Clean Power for Transport’. Depending on the distances to be covered, a large vessel has a very different energy need than a compact electric car designed for short trips in the city centre. Given these differences, it is clear that a comprehensive mix of alternative fuels is needed. The development of the alternative-fuels market, including investments in their infrastructure, is also expected to boost the economy and create new jobs. According to research by the European Climate Foundation, greening cars could create 700 000 extra jobs in the EU by 2025. Moreover, the alternative fuels market could also significantly reduce the EU’s dependence on oil and thus the economic risks linked to fluctuations in supply. Renewing existing fleets with more efficient models will take time. Given their longer lifespan, replacing aircraft, train and ship fleets, will take more time than for cars and trucks. For passenger cars, car-sharing schemes could actually offer an interesting alternative to the ‘one household-one car’ model, especially for urban residents, and speed up the renewal of the fleet. Car-sharing could also mean savings for the user as the costs of owning a car (purchase, maintenance, insurance, etc.) would be shared by a group of users. It could also reduce the number of cars parked in cities. What used to be a symbol of social status — car ownership — should no longer be perceived as such. Higher taxes for the more polluting transport modes? Pricing can provide another push for the user towards greener transport. Taxes applied to more polluting transport modes make them more expensive and are likely to reduce the demand. The opposite is valid for cleaner options: reducing taxes can lure more users to cleaner transport. More than half of Europeans believe that lower prices and better public transport are the best ways to improve urban travel. Road transport fuel is already heavily taxed across the EU compared to other transport modes. Nevertheless, different types of road fuels are taxed at different rates, influencing the composition of the vehicle fleet. For example, lower taxes and other incentives on diesel in many EU countries resulted in a significant increase in the number of diesel vehicles sold.

"towards-clean-and-smart-mobility  Towards clean and smart mobility  Transport plays a critical role in the way we live. Our food, clothes and household waste all need to be transported, contributing to our economy and quality of life.  But the increasing use of planes, cars and other fossil-fuel dependent modes of transport is causing more pollution, putting at risk our environment and health. The European Environment Agency’s (EEA) Signals 2016 explores how Europe’s carbon-dependent transport sector can be turned into a clean and smart mobility system.     EEA Signals 2016 – Towards green and smart mobility  goes beyond the data and statistics on transport, giving an in-depth explanation of the key facts and trends, the environmental challenges facing transport, and the green choices we have to ensure cleaner modes of moving around.   Transport underpins our modern society and economy. At the same time, it is responsible for a quarter of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions, and causes air pollution, noise pollution and habitat fragmentation.   The European Union has already taken measures to mitigate the effects of transport pollution, and it has launched work on ambitious plans to create a low-carbon economy by 2050. These plans include making sure transport plays its part in reducing emissions.   “The EU’s transport sector depends on oil for 94 % of its fuel. It is clear that decarbonising Europe’s transport sector will take time. It requires a combination of measures, including better urban planning, technological improvements, and a wider use of alternative fuels. But it can be done and we know how we can make it happen. Cleaner and smarter transport can actually meet Europe’s need for mobility and at the same time deliver many public health benefits, including cleaner air, fewer accidents, less congestion and less noise pollution,” says EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx.

"transport-and-ecosystems  Transport and ecosystems  Transport networks have become a commonplace feature of the European landscape. They connect people, boost economic activity and provide access to key services, but they also introduce barriers between natural areas, while their use emits pollutants and introduces non-local species to ecosystems. Strong policy measures and a network of green spaces can help preserve and protect Europe’s natural wealth.   The European continent is connected by an extensive transport network, comprising motorways, roads, rail tracks, navigable rivers, cycle paths, flight routes and sea routes. In addition to bringing goods and services to people, transport networks shape and impact the environment around them.   Less space for nature?   Transport is often associated with economic development. Connecting a city or region to major transport networks can give an initial boost to the local economy and create new jobs. However, once a region has reached a certain level of connectivity, additional transport infrastructure does not give comparable benefits. It can, however, generate substantial environmental impacts. Transport networks can also facilitate the spread of urban areas and other built-up areas into relatively rural and sparsely populated parts of Europe, exerting pressure on natural habitats. For example, connecting remote mountain regions or islands to the European transport system could attract more tourists to the area, resulting, for example, in a boost to accommodation and food-catering services. However, increased economic activity also often comes with the negative impacts of human settlements — more wastewater, more solid waste etc.   Similarly, an increasing demand for biofuels can also result in additional demand for land and freshwater resources in Europe. When combined with land required for food production, it can lead to more natural areas being converted to agricultural land.   Air and noise pollution in nature   Transport also leads to releases of pollutants, which can spread beyond the reach of transport networks. They can contribute to background concentrations of particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide, affecting people, plants and animals. Some areas, including mountainous regions, coastal zones and seas, can be particularly vulnerable to pollution from transport. Transport corridors through Alpine valleys or along large rivers like the Danube are essential for the European economy, but also exert pressure on unique ecosystems. Certain pollutants, such as ground-level ozone, are known to lower crop yields, affect tree growth and cause acidification in lakes.   Similarly, oil spills or the release of hazardous substances at sea can cause considerable damage to marine life. Recognising these risks, many measures have been put in place at European and international levels.   Noise pollution from transport is another concern and its impacts are not limited to land ecosystems alone. Large ships generate significant amounts of noise. Their hulls tend to amplify the mechanical noise from the engine and propellers. Due to its low frequency, this type of noise propagates very far in water and disturbs marine life. Research indicates that whales and other species that communicate and orient themselves through sound are particularly affected. Potential impacts suffered by small fish and marine invertebrate populations are also becoming clearer thanks to  ongoing research .   Some solutions are already available and are quite effective in reducing noise pollution at sea and on land. For example, ships can be designed with their engines placed further from the hull (e.g. electric propulsion motors in pods outside the hull) to minimise noise amplification. Similarly, car engines and parts (e.g. tyres) could be redesigned to reduce noise levels at source, or noise barriers along motorways could be extended.   Unwanted free riders on board   In addition to pollution, transport can also bring non-local species into new habitats, risking significant harm to local species. Construction of large transport projects, such as the Suez Canal, can alter the key characteristics of an entire ecosystem. Since the building of the canal, more than 500 non-indigenous marine species were introduced to the Mediterranean Sea, contributing to ‘a  catastrophic anthropogenic ecosystem shift  in the Mediterranean Sea’. In the case of maritime transport, large ships, especially those used in freight transport, take in water to stabilise the vessel. Depending on their cargo load, they release this ballast water, which often carries in it many bacteria, microbes, small invertebrates, eggs and larvae of various species. If introduced in sufficient quantities and in the absence of predators, the impact of alien species can be devastating.   The case of the comb jellyfish ,Mnemiopsis leidyi— a species native to the American Atlantic coast — is well known and well-documented. Mnemiopsiswas introduced into the Black Sea through ballast water in the early 1980s and had devastating effects on local marine life, affecting fish populations and fishing communities. Recognising the ecological risk posed by ballast waters, a number of international measures and guidelines have been set by the International Maritime Organisation, including the Convention on Ballast Water Management.   Ballast water is only one of the ways alien species are transported. Fruit seeds thrown from passenger cars, bacteria or insect eggs in the discarded soil found in imported flowerpots, and exotic fish or bird species released into nature can all impact local ecosystems.   Investing in green infrastructure   All man-made infrastructure networks — road, rail and inland water canals — connect urban areas, rural areas and people. But they also build barriers and divide the natural landscape into smaller areas. A multi-lane motorway cutting through a forest represents a physical barrier for animal and plant species. In addition to reducing the total area available for wild life, a lack of connectivity between different habitats makes their populations more vulnerable. Animals need to move around to find food and mate, and risk being injured or killed while trying to cross roads or rail tracks. Even fences around transport networks could isolate the population of a particular species such that their genetic pool is limited, making them more vulnerable to diseases, and ultimately dying out.   Better connectivity through tunnels or bridges would certainly reduce the pressure on Europe’s biodiversity and ecosystems. In fact, these initiatives could be better planned on a much wider scale than a single infrastructure project, involving a multitude of different stakeholders (planners, investors, citizens, public authorities at various governance levels etc.).   A ‘green infrastructure’ consists of a strategically planned network of high-quality green spaces. It requires a wider look at all green spaces — in remote, rural and urban areas, and beyond national borders — connects between them so as to facilitate movement of species. To this end, the European Union adopted a  Green Infrastructure Strategy  aimed at providing a vision for a trans-European green network, as well as facilitating coordination among stakeholders, and exchange of ideas and information.   Better connectivity is not the only positive outcome of green infrastructure. In addition to improving public health, it is increasingly seen as a  cost-efficient way  of reducing current (or future) weather- and climate-related natural hazards. For example, instead of building sewerage systems to transport extreme rainwater, cities can create green areas to absorb excess water.   Planning with nature in mind   Transport infrastructure projects, including those related to the Trans-European Network, have contributed to enhancing quality of life across Europe, bringing services and public goods to remote parts. Several studies  [1]   partly link the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) to the EU’s failure to meet its target to halt biodiversity loss. Other studies  [2]   highlight the potential impacts of TEN-T projects on protected areas.   The EU’s recent transport policy has significantly strengthened nature and biodiversity considerations. Now, these concerns need to be taken into account from the planning phase. Moreover, Member States need to carry out environmental impact assessments for such projects.  EU legislation  also covers the potential impacts of infrastructure projects taking place outside protected areas, but which can still affect them.   This approach could translate into various measures on the ground. For example, in the case of rail and road networks, the route proposal could be changed to leave larger areas untouched and to avoid landscape fragmentation. Similarly, tunnels or nature bridges could be planned and built to increase connectivity between protected areas, and facilitate the movement of animal populations. If the project does not comply with these rules, EU funding can be withdrawn.   Stricter environmental protection rules have already led to changes in several projects. An inland navigation project, aimed at deepening the Weser River in Germany, would allow ships to easier access to the Bremerhaven harbour. An environmental NGO challenged the project plans, arguing that the deepening the river would change the salinity level and create stronger tides, posing a threat to animal species dependant on the river as well as to people living on its banks. The  European Court of Justice ruled  that the project would deteriorate the water quality in the Weser and constitute a breach of the EU’s Water Framework Directive. Consequently, the project was cancelled.   Similar to transport and energy networks bringing economic wealth across Europe, a trans-European network of green infrastructure could actually help foster healthy and rich nature.

Fruit seeds thrown from passenger cars, bacteria or insect eggs in the discarded soil found in imported flowerpots, and exotic fish or bird species released into nature can all impact local ecosystems. Investing in green infrastructure All man-made infrastructure networks — road, rail and inland water canals — connect urban areas, rural areas and people. But they also build barriers and divide the natural landscape into smaller areas. A multi-lane motorway cutting through a forest represents a physical barrier for animal and plant species. In addition to reducing the total area available for wild life, a lack of connectivity between different habitats makes their populations more vulnerable. Animals need to move around to find food and mate, and risk being injured or killed while trying to cross roads or rail tracks. Even fences around transport networks could isolate the population of a particular species such that their genetic pool is limited, making them more vulnerable to diseases, and ultimately dying out. Better connectivity through tunnels or bridges would certainly reduce the pressure on Europe’s biodiversity and ecosystems. In fact, these initiatives could be better planned on a much wider scale than a single infrastructure project, involving a multitude of different stakeholders (planners, investors, citizens, public authorities at various governance levels etc.). A ‘green infrastructure’ consists of a strategically planned network of high-quality green spaces. It requires a wider look at all green spaces — in remote, rural and urban areas, and beyond national borders — connects between them so as to facilitate movement of species. To this end, the European Union adopted a Green Infrastructure Strategy aimed at providing a vision for a trans-European green network, as well as facilitating coordination among stakeholders, and exchange of ideas and information. Better connectivity is not the only positive outcome of green infrastructure. In addition to improving public health, it is increasingly seen as a cost-efficient way of reducing current (or future) weather- and climate-related natural hazards. For example, instead of building sewerage systems to transport extreme rainwater, cities can create green areas to absorb excess water. Planning with nature in mind Transport infrastructure projects, including those related to the Trans-European Network, have contributed to enhancing quality of life across Europe, bringing services and public goods to remote parts. Several studies[1] partly link the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) to the EU’s failure to meet its target to halt biodiversity loss. Other studies[2] highlight the potential impacts of TEN-T projects on protected areas. The EU’s recent transport policy has significantly strengthened nature and biodiversity considerations. Now, these concerns need to be taken into account from the planning phase. Moreover, Member States need to carry out environmental impact assessments for such projects. EU legislation also covers the potential impacts of infrastructure projects taking place outside protected areas, but which can still affect them. This approach could translate into various measures on the ground. For example, in the case of rail and road networks, the route proposal could be changed to leave larger areas untouched and to avoid landscape fragmentation. Similarly, tunnels or nature bridges could be planned and built to increase connectivity between protected areas, and facilitate the movement of animal populations. If the project does not comply with these rules, EU funding can be withdrawn. Stricter environmental protection rules have already led to changes in several projects. An inland navigation project, aimed at deepening the Weser River in Germany, would allow ships to easier access to the Bremerhaven harbour. An environmental NGO challenged the project plans, arguing that the deepening the river would change the salinity level and create stronger tides, posing a threat to animal species dependant on the river as well as to people living on its banks. The European Court of Justice ruled that the project would deteriorate the water quality in the Weser and constitute a breach of the EU’s Water Framework Directive. Consequently, the project was cancelled. Similar to transport and energy networks bringing economic wealth across Europe, a trans-European network of green infrastructure could actually help foster healthy and rich nature.

"2018people-first2019-for-greener-liveable-cities  ‘People-first’ for greener, liveable cities  Our cities are under pressure like never before from increasing populations, traffic gridlock and climate change. How can we make them easier to get around, more liveable and sustainable? One urban design firm is helping transform the way we plan cities. We talked to Helle Søholt, founding partner and CEO of Gehl Architects, Copenhagen, to find out.   What does an ideal city look like and is such a model realistic?   It is difficult to create the perfect green city, but we do have an overall vision. Our key guiding principle can be summarised as ‘people first’. We are making cities for people — to support their ability to have a better quality of life in a sustainable way, while ensuring social inclusion both in the short and long term. We have to understand people’s physical and social requirements and their need to have access to work. In addition, cities must have a well-integrated mobility system and the capacity to deal better with climate change. We see cities struggling globally on these issues, but putting in place practical solutions to these issues is realistic.   In terms of mobility, well-built transport networks need to be put in place to ensure that the city is walkable and ‘bikeable’. People should be able to get around very easily, not only in their local neighbourhoods but also over distances between 5 and 10 kilometres away.   Public and green areas are also essential. They enable us to meet others and feel connected but also give us a sense of freedom and space beyond our private homes. A city needs a wide variety of accessible public spaces in local neighbourhoods like playgrounds for kids and families, local parks and calm areas that bring us closer to nature. People who have access to nature feel less stress in urban environments.   A city should also have other types of public spaces, such as plazas or squares, where people can gather and enjoy commercial or cultural activities. Such diversity of space in a city helps meet people’s social needs. Similarly, the buildings should consist of a mix of old and new, offering residential opportunities for all income groups and integrating work places. All these places should be easily reachable by public transport to encourage people to adopt sustainable behaviour.   How do you assess mobility problems?   We have developed a data-driven approach; what we call the ‘public life/public space method’. Many cities already assess economic performance, public transport use, and current and future vehicle use. But the more social and cultural elements of the city are often not assessed. Here at Gehl Architects, we try to map these elements and make them visible. Who are the people using the city? How do they move? What public activities take place in the city? Who attends them? What can we do for those groups not using the city? We try to get to the root of certain behavioural patterns and use this knowledge to develop the city.   For example, in one of our projects, we conducted a public space/public life survey to understand why New Road was failing to attract people — pedestrians, shoppers — although it was located in the popular core of Brighton in the United Kingdom. Our analysis showed that the road would be a perfect link between the inner city and the nearby university and library. We proposed to open it up towards the park nearby and designed it for pedestrians, but allowed vehicles to pass at low speed. The street became very quickly the fourth most used space in the city.   Who contributes to a city’s design?   We work closely with community groups, local NGOs, business improvement groups and local government. When we upgrade a city, we have to make sure the spaces we create benefit people living and working nearby. We do a lot of before and after surveys. This feedback often encourages political leaders to move forward.   People who live in the city also need to be involved. For example, we often face reluctance or opposition when pedestrianising commercial districts. Based on our data, the number of pedestrians walking in front of shops increases massively in newly created car-free areas. By sharing the data, we can convince people and businesses of the social and economic benefits. We actually invite people to vote with their feet.   It is important to have a focus on what we call software (the culture or use of the city) — and hardware (the roads, streets and buildings and the physical environment) because these two things have to go hand in hand.   Are there any trade-offs to attain urban equality, quality of life and mobility?   It’s not about trade-offs. It’s about flexibility and being more balanced in designing cities. Rather than pedestrianising one street, the focus should be on having a much more integrated network where all streets are walkable, bikeable, and nice places to live and work. Our current silo approach has to change. We have to work on many different levels to ensure cities are safe and comfortable to move around in so people feel that they can still go where they want without owning a car. Cities should develop multiple and well-functioning transport systems to give people a choice.   To strike that balance between mobility needs and quality of life, some cities have restricted car access to certain areas. Cities like Copenhagen, London, Stockholm and others have done this by introducing congestion charges or increasing the cost of parking downtown. This makes other transport options like cycling or public transport more appealing.   Are European cities adapting to a greener transport model?   I think Europe is leading the way. Many European cities have well-functioning public transport and have also pedestrianised parts of their urban areas over recent decades. Copenhagen and Amsterdam are the two top cities for cycling, while Berlin also has quite high numbers of cyclists.   There are challenges when it comes to other cities. Paris was a pioneer when it introduced a public bicycle system. It became a global example. But it has not been as brave in implementing infrastructure more concretely, i.e. taking space away from cars and making a more connected cycling network. Many cities have similar issues and unfortunately cycling accidents do happen. This stops people seeing cycling as a safe alternative.   Many cities consider their streets too narrow for bicycles. I would say they’re too narrow for cars! People don’t take up as much space when moving on foot or by bicycle.   We also need to connect city centres with outlying areas better. This involves a focus on the journey and an understanding that public transport, be it trains or buses, can act as a continuation of our public spaces from home to work and back again.   What future challenges do we face in terms of mobility and the city?   There are many challenges ahead: increased urbanisation, climate change, transport, food production, energy consumption, social inclusion... Security has also become a real issue for public spaces. When people perceive public spaces as unsafe, they might prefer to use cars instead.   Urban mobility also touches upon public health. We are collaborating with Novo Nordisk to tackle diabetes in cities as 80 % of the world’s diabetic population lives in cities. We see that government health budgets are growing enormously and designing cities differently could certainly help combat diabetes.   An aging population is another challenge. We are working in Tokyo and in parts of Europe where the age demographic is changing rapidly. Our cities need to be designed in a way that makes it easier for an aging population to get around. The key here is to understand that for all of these challenges, the city is part of the solution and the design of the city can help us change people’s behaviour.

"towards-cleaner-and-smarter-mobility  Towards cleaner and smarter mobility  Transport connects people, cultures, cities, countries and continents. It is one of the main pillars of the modern society and economy, allowing producers to sell their products across the world and travellers to discover new places. Transport networks also ensure access to key public services, such as education and health, contributing to a better quality of life. Connecting to transport helps boost the economy in remote areas, creating jobs and spreading wealth.   Transport also plays a decisive role in shaping the way we live: our food, clothes and household waste all need to be transported; it influences what products are on offer and what we consume; and we use transport systems to go to work, school, the theatre and on holiday. Today high-speed train connections make long daily commutes possible, allowing people to live hundreds of kilometres away from their work.   There is, however, a downside to our current transport model. The transport sector causes substantial negative impacts on the environment and human health. Transport is responsible for a quarter of the EU’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and causes air pollution, noise pollution and habitat fragmentation. More concretely, it is the only major economic sector in Europe where GHGs have increased since 1990 and is also the largest contributor to nitrogen oxides emissions, which harm health and the environment. Similarly, road transport is one of the main sources of environmental noise pollution in Europe.   Transport demand to rise further   Today the demand for transport in Europe is significantly higher than in 2000 and is expected to continue growing. According to European Commission estimates, by 2050 passenger transport is projected to grow by more than 50 % and freight transport by 80 % compared to 2013 levels.   Other challenges lie ahead. Europe’s transport depends heavily on oil. Oil consumption not only releases GHGs and air pollutants into the atmosphere and contributes to climate change, but also makes the European economy more vulnerable towards fluctuations in global energy supplies and prices.   Moreover, despite transport’s central importance to our economy and quality of life, not enough attention is paid to preparing Europe’s transport infrastructure to the challenges posed by climate change. Can Europe’s rail and road infrastructure cope with higher temperatures? Disruptions in transport services — volcano ash in the air, flooded roads or damaged rail tracks due to extreme weather — can have serious consequences for travellers, daily commuters and businesses, well beyond the affected area.   The transport system also needs to adapt to changes in Europe’s demographics. How can public transport be adapted to the mobility needs of an increasingly older population?   Technological improvements are not enough   In recent years, new cars and vans sold in Europe have become more and more energy efficient. For each kilometre travelled, they consume less fuel and release fewer pollutants than older models. Stricter policy measures have been instrumental in achieving these gains. Nevertheless, the number of vehicles on the road and the distances they travel continue to grow. Similarly, aircraft engines have become more efficient, but more passengers are flying and travelling further.   Incremental efficiency gains through technological improvements will fail to break the sector’s dependence on fossil fuels and negate its environmental impacts. Even after recent efficiency improvements in car engines, only up to a quarter of the fuel burnt is actually used for moving the vehicle. The rest is lost as heat, mechanical inefficiencies or is used for accessories. Moreover, recent improvements in official fuel efficiency statistics have been questioned. There are significant discrepancies between fuel consumption observed in real-world driving and testing under laboratory conditions.   Ultimately, the issue is not just about cars, planes, roads, ships or fuels — the different components of the transport system — but about the need to move people and goods from one place to another in an easy, safe and efficient way. We must build a clean, smart and comprehensive ‘mobility’ system that caters to mobility needs by offering a service tailored to user requirements.   Defining the mobility need: essential or a treat?   The need may vary depending on the way we live. People living in compact cities where everything can be accessed on foot are less likely to rely on private cars. Fuel prices, housing and job markets, income levels and low interest rates on bank loans can all influence how much and how we travel, or how the goods we consume are brought to us. Even topography can influence our choice of transport.   Globalisation of markets (e.g. global trade and travel) would not have been possible without extensive transport networks. The world economy grew along with transport demand, each fuelling the growth of the other. In today’s globalised world, consumers can buy products that only a few decades ago were not on offer, and which are now delivered to their doorsteps. Our lifestyles and consumption aspirations have changed accordingly. We expect to find cheap tomatoes on supermarket shelves and to take affordable vacations all year round. Ultimately, we should not be afraid of asking whether we actually need all this transport.   The mobility need can be assessed in different ways. First, is the journey essential or just a pleasant treat? Can it be avoided? Second, can the journey be shifted to a more environment-friendly transport mode, such as opting for train travel instead of flying, or for public transport instead of driving? And last, can the transport mode be improved?   The European Union’s transport policies build on these ‘avoid, shift and improve’ principles, among others. Many measures in use to help curb the negative impacts of the transport sector, including fuel taxes, tolls or other road charges, are based on the ‘user/polluter pays’ principle. Such measures usually aim to reduce environmental impacts. Higher taxes and tolls, for example, might increase the price of using the vehicle, which in turn can lower the demand.   Unfortunately, the prices users currently pay for transport services do not reflect the full cost on the environment and public health. Carbon prices, global oil prices and passenger car prices tend to be too low to send a strong signal to users and investors.   Furthermore, the price signal can be distorted by transport subsidies, the use of which remains widespread in Europe. In some cases, subsidies are designed to promote cleaner modes, e.g. those provided to public transport. In other cases, such as tax breaks for company cars, tax exemptions on international aviation or shipping fuels and differential tax treatment for diesel and petrol, subsidies can have adverse impacts on the environment and lock the transport system in to an unsustainable path.   Mobilising ideas, policy and funds   The current mix of transport modes and fuels is simply not sustainable. The choice is ours: we can choose to build a clean, accessible, coherent, climate-resilient mobility system that greatly contributes to our quality of life and well-being.   Cleaner and smarter transport can actually meet Europe’s need for mobility, and at the same time deliver many public health benefits, including cleaner air, fewer accidents, less congestion and less noise pollution. Where feasible, encouraging a switch to active mobility modes, such as walking and cycling, can also help improve other health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and obesity.   It is clear that decarbonising Europe’s transport sector will take time. It requires a combination of measures, including better urban planning, technological improvements, a wider use of alternative fuels, stronger price signals, innovative research, continuous adoption of cutting-edge technology and stricter enforcement of existing rules. It also requires all investments in infrastructure and policy measures to be designed to this end.   Turning Europe’s carbon-dependent transport sector into a clean and smart mobility system might seem like a colossal task. It can be done and we know how we can make it happen. It is also a must, given the current transport system’s impacts on the environment and public health. I personally see it as an exciting opportunity for us to build a better and cleaner future.        Hans Bruyninckx  EEA Executive Director            Metro Madrid  transport demand mobility transport modes signals2016,Transport also plays a decisive role in shaping the way we live: our food, clothes and household waste all need to be transported; it influences what products are on offer and what we consume; and we use transport systems to go to work, school, the theatre and on holiday.

"feeding-the-hungry-city  Feeding the hungry city  Ingredients for the meals we eat at home or in restaurants come from near and afar. In an increasingly urbanised and globalised world, the food produced in the countryside needs to be transported to the city. Much focus has been put on reducing ‘food miles’, which can be a relevant but sometimes limited concept. A smarter and cleaner transport system would solve only part of the issue. A wider systemic analysis of the entire food system is in order.   Even if we live on a farm, most of the food we eat needs to be transported in one way or another. As three in four Europeans live in cities, the supply of food is highly dependent on transport, which is currently heavily reliant on burning fossil fuels. This of course has negative impacts on the environment and the climate.   Globally, more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas and, according to the United Nations, this share is  projected to increase  to about two-thirds — more than six billion people — by 2050. Many of these urbanites are projected to be in the growing and relatively affluent middle class, so the demand for transporting all kinds of food to cater both to our needs and tastes is likely to increase.   Distance travelled doesn’t tell much about the journey   Transporting food, people and goods has many environmental impacts, including air pollution, noise, landscape fragmentation and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Concern for these impacts has led to the concept of ‘food miles’, which usually means the distance the food has travelled to reach homes, supermarkets or restaurants.   Calculating ‘food miles’ can, in some cases, be a useful way to estimate your meal’s environmental impacts. But it also has a number of important limitations: only a part of the environmental impacts related to food come from its transport. In terms of GHG emissions, how the food is produced (e.g. in heated greenhouses or in open fields in its growing season) is usually much more important than the distance transported. In fact, most of the environmental impacts of what we eat are linked to the  production phase , which involves cutting down forests for agricultural use, irrigation, using chemical fertilisers, feeding animals and so on.   Looking just at food miles not only ignores the way the food was produced, but also the type of food we are buying.  Going vegetarian  or simply reducing meat consumption, switching type of meat and cutting  food waste  might cut your food-related GHG footprint by a quarter.   Moreover, food miles typically look at the journey from the point of production to the supermarket or restaurant. However, transporting large quantities of food from one point to another can actually be highly efficient. Your own choice of transport mode — by foot, bicycle, car or bus — to the supermarket and back home may be much more important when estimating your meal’s environmental impact.   Determining who sells what   Food miles are probably of minor concern compared to how food is brought to consumers. There is no single, common food supply chain at European level. In recent years, logistics providers have been trying to form alliances and provide services across Europe. Despite this trend, cost pressures faced by pan-European logistics providers mean that many rely on subcontracting small operators. As a result, a significant share of  road freight  is still subcontracted to, and transported by, a myriad of small enterprises and driver-owners.   At the same time, according to a  study by the European Commission , food retail has become more concentrated in the EU because of the penetration of supermarket chains, hypermarkets and discounters with a centralised distribution system involving modern logistics. In other words, fewer players are operating in food retail. This has resulted in more efficient logistics and cost savings, but has arguably affected the selection of food items available to consumers and made it harder for smaller producers to enter wider distribution systems.   These centralised logistics systems can also be subject to failures, leaving supermarkets and consumers vulnerable to disruptions in food supply. For example,  fuel protests  in the United Kingdom in 2000 led supermarkets in some cases to ration food until supply lines were re-established.   Basing our food system on large-scale transport also has implications on the type of food we eat. As food needs to stay fresh — or at least edible — during and after transport, much fresh produce has to be plucked raw, and for many types of food using conservatives becomes a necessity.   Age of the pizza drone?    Online grocery shopping is growing rapidly in Europe  and this may mean a major transformation of how food reaches consumers. However, it’s not very clear if this would be good or bad for the environment.   According to a study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology on shopping for electronics, clothing and toys, online shopping was the most environmentally friendly option. There were two main reasons for this: the buyer’s journey to the store was avoided and maintaining a retailer website generates significantly  fewer emissions  (and uses less energy) than a physical retail store. However, if you already live next to a grocery store, the calculation may provide different results. Several factors can be at play: How close is the nearest grocery shop? Do you walk, bike or drive there? Are you buying food for an entire week or just for one meal?   Another question is how our shopping habits keep up with changes in transport technology. Self-driving electric trucks and pizza-delivery drones may become a reality much sooner than we think. In long-haul transportation, more efficient container ships — possibly slow steam ships coupled with sails — could change the game.   Similarly, our diets might change in favour of vegetarian choices. Or our protein need might be largely met by aquaculture or insects. In terms of logistics, it would also be much easier to transport highly nutritious, concentrated powders or pills, but these dry solutions might not match the image most of us have of a delicious dinner, not yet at least.   Other innovative solutions, such as growing food in cities, for example on vertical farms and rooftops, can both reduce the transport need and also help cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.   Looking at Europe’s food system   The EU 7 th  Environment Action Programme sets an ambitious goal of ‘living well, within the limits of our planet’. It also identifies both food and mobility, together with housing, as key sectors where the overall life-cycle environmental impact of consumption should be reduced. Together, these sectors are  responsible for almost 80 %  of the environmental impacts of consumption.   Tackling food waste, which amounts to  some 179 kg  for an average EU citizen per year, seems like a good place to start as it should also reduce the need for food transport. However, to tackle unsustainable consumption, we need to address the entire food system, including production, consumption and governance.   This understanding has been at the heart of recent assessments by the EEA, including the ‘Greening the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP)’  paper  and the agriculture briefing in the ‘European environment — state and outlook 2015’ report ( SOER 2015 ). Systemic analyses address food in a wider sustainability context, linking it not only to its current environmental impacts, but also to issues such as food security in a globalised world, growing demand for food linked to global population growth, raising income levels, impacts of climate change on food production, changing diets with obesity on the one hand and malnutrition on the other.   Food market  urban signals2016 food waste cities food system food transport,Even if we live on a farm, most of the food we eat needs to be transported in one way or another. As three in four Europeans live in cities, the supply of food is highly dependent on transport, which is currently heavily reliant on burning fossil fuels. This of course has negative impacts on the environment and the climate. Globally, more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas and, according to the United Nations, this share is projected to increase to about two-thirds — more than six billion people — by 2050. Many of these urbanites are projected to be in the growing and relatively affluent middle class, so the demand for transporting all kinds of food to cater both to our needs and tastes is likely to increase. Distance travelled doesn’t tell much about the journey Transporting food, people and goods has many environmental impacts, including air pollution, noise, landscape fragmentation and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Concern for these impacts has led to the concept of ‘food miles’, which usually means the distance the food has travelled to reach homes, supermarkets or restaurants. Calculating ‘food miles’ can, in some cases, be a useful way to estimate your meal’s environmental impacts. But it also has a number of important limitations: only a part of the environmental impacts related to food come from its transport. In terms of GHG emissions, how the food is produced (e.g. in heated greenhouses or in open fields in its growing season) is usually much more important than the distance transported. In fact, most of the environmental impacts of what we eat are linked to the production phase, which involves cutting down forests for agricultural use, irrigation, using chemical fertilisers, feeding animals and so on. Looking just at food miles not only ignores the way the food was produced, but also the type of food we are buying. Going vegetarian or simply reducing meat consumption, switching type of meat and cutting food waste might cut your food-related GHG footprint by a quarter.

"transport-in-europe-key-facts-trends  Transport in Europe: key facts and trends  Despite temporary slowdowns, the demand for transport of both passengers and goods has been growing steadily and is projected to continue. As such, more and more cars are sold in Europe, the majority of which are diesel powered. And while engines are becoming more efficient, this growth means GHG emissions are a major concern.   Europe is connected through a network of roads, railway lines, inland waterways, inland and maritime ports, airports and rail-road terminals. Not counting secondary roads and railway lines, the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) alone consists of more than 138 000 km of railway lines, 136 700 km of roads and 23 506 km of inland waterways. Around  879 million  passengers travelled by air in the European Union in 2014, of whom 73 million used London’s Heathrow Airport alone. Finally, close to 3.8 billion tonnes of goods were handled in EU ports, 10 % of which was handled by Rotterdam.   More freight and more passengers   The volume of freight has increased considerably since the 1990s, despite a relative decrease following the economic recession in 2008. This increase has been largely accommodated by road transport, which accounted for 49 % of EU freight transported in 2013, and to a lesser extent, sea and rail transport. However, road transport emits considerably more carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) per kilometre than other modes, such as rail and inland waterways.   Similarly, the demand for passenger transport (measured in passenger kilometres) also grew by more than 8 % between 2000 and 2013 in the EU, with flying experiencing the most rapid growth. Finally, EU citizens travelled approximately 12 850 km per person in 2013 — more than 70 % by car — representing a 5 % increase from 2000.   More cars on the road   This growth means that road transport now accounts for almost three quarters of the energy used in transport in the EU. Sales of new passenger cars in the EU increased by 9 % in 2015 compared to the previous year, with a total of 13.7 million new cars registered.   Recent data point to a growth in diesel consumption in road transport, up from 52 % of total road fuel consumption in 2000 to 70 % in 2014. Similarly, just over half of the vehicles sold in Europe are diesel, corresponding to 52 % of sales in 2015. The share of diesel vehicle sales varies from country to country, ranging from 71 % in Ireland and Luxembourg to 29 % in the Netherlands and 28 % in Denmark. Larger vehicles are more likely to use diesel, and over last four decades, the average  mass of passenger cars  has increased mainly due to consumer preferences and improved safety standards. Heavier cars tend to use more fuel and emit more greenhouse gases and pollutants.   Different types of electric vehicles are now available on the European market. Some rely entirely on an electric battery to power the vehicle, while others use a combination of electricity and petrol/diesel-hybrids.   More and more hybrid and battery-electric vehicles are being sold in the EU. Although they still represent just 1.3 % of all new cars sold, in some countries, electric cars are becoming a more common sight. According to  provisional data , in the Netherlands 12 % and in Denmark 8 % of the new cars sold in 2015 were electric or plug-in hybrid. In terms of purely electric cars, the largest number of registrations was recorded in France (more than 17 650 vehicles), Germany (more than 12 350 vehicles) and the UK (more than 9 900 vehicles). Electric two wheelers have also become more common, especially for journeys within urban areas.   Financial incentives, such as subsidies or preferential tax treatments (e.g. free parking in city centre, possibility to drive on bus lanes, free tolls, lower fuel or registration taxes), play a major role in the consumer’s choice of the type of car purchased.   Transport and greenhouse gas emissions   Motorised vehicles need the energy generated from fuel (e.g. petrol, diesel, electricity, natural gas, biofuels) to move. But the high temperature combustion of fossil fuels in engines releases air pollutants and CO 2  into the atmosphere.   Transport demand is closely linked to economic activity: in periods of growth, economic output goes up, more goods are transported and more people travel. The economic recession of 2008 resulted in lower transport demand and, consequently, in reduced greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the sector in the following years following. Despite this slow down period, the EU’s overall transport emissions in 2014 were 20 % higher  [1]     than their 1990 levels.   In 2014, about a quarter of the EU’s total GHG emissions came from transport.  [2]     According to preliminary data, passenger cars contributed to 44 % of transport sector emissions, and heavy-duty vehicles and buses a further 18 %.   Emissions from different transport modes varied substantially over time. International aviation emissions almost doubled and road transport increased by 17 % in this period, whereas emissions from rail transport and inland navigation declined by more than 50 % and almost 37 % respectively.   Reduction targets   The EU has set itself several targets to reduce GHG emissions from transport. In its White Paper published in 2011, the European Commission set a target of a 60 % reduction from 1990 levels by 2050. This means that current levels need to be reduced by two thirds.   Transport also needs to contribute to the EU’s overall targets for GHG emissions reductions by 2020 and 2030. Part of the 2030 target will be achieved through the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Although it includes emissions from aviation, other transport emissions are excluded. This means that with the exception of intra-EU aviation, the remaining transport modes will need to contribute to the 30 % reduction effort for the sectors excluded  [3]   from the EU ETS.   To achieve GHG emissions reductions in these non-ETS sectors, the overall EU effort is shared among Member States. Each country then decides how to achieve its national target. This is known as the Effort Sharing Decision and it will contribute to a ‘30% reduction by 2030’. Currently, around one third of the GHG emissions from non-ETS sectors come from the transport sector.   The EU’s transport sector  depends on oil  for 94 % of its fuel, 90 % of which is imported. This makes it particularly vulnerable to instability and changes in the global energy market. A disruption in the energy supply could severely undermine the economy and hamper the quality of life in the EU. To this end, the EU aims to reduce its oil consumption in transport (including maritime bunkers) by 70 % by 2050 compared to 2008 levels.   All these targets require reliable and effective monitoring and measuring systems to measure progress. The European Environment Agency helps evaluate progress through datasets, indicators and reports, including the annual  transport and environment report  TERM.   Carbon dioxide from cars and vans   To help reduce the EU’s overall GHG emissions, the EU has put in place increasingly stringent mandatory targets for average CO 2  emissions for new passenger cars and vans. By 2015, new cars registered in the EU had to achieve the average emissions target of 130 grams of CO 2  per kilometre (g CO 2 /km). This target was achieved two years ahead of the deadline. According to the latest EEA data, new cars registered in 2015 emitted on average 119.6 g CO 2 /km. The next target is set at 95 g CO 2 /km by 2021.   Similar targets are set for light commercial vehicles (vans). New vans registered in the EU must meet the average emissions targets of 175 g CO 2 /km by 2017, and 147 g CO 2 /km by 2020. The 2017 target was achieved four years ahead of schedule. In 2015, average emissions for new vans amounted to 168.2 g CO 2 /km.   Official test results show that vehicles are becoming more energy-efficient and are polluting less. However, there are concerns regarding the way emissions are measured. The targets set in EU legislation are based on a standardised procedure, which is necessary to compare between different models over time. The testing procedure currently used in the EU — the New European Driving Cycle — was introduced in 1970 and last updated in 1997. It no longer reflects real-world driving conditions in Europe. European traffic has changed considerably since then. Cars have become heavier and faster; roads more congested. The current procedure also allows manufacturers many flexibilities in testing parameters, such as vehicle mass, tyre pressure and adjustments to brakes. As a result of all these factors combined, cars and vans tend to emit significantly higher amounts of carbon dioxide on the road than in a laboratory under the current testing procedure. According to  research  by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), real-world emissions of CO 2  are up to 40 % higher than emissions measured in the testing laboratory.   Recognising such shortcomings, in January 2016, the European Commission  proposed a number of changes  to the current vehicle type-approval framework. These are designed to strengthen the independence of vehicle testing, and improve the enforcement and market surveillance regimes. A new emissions testing procedure known as the ‘Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure’ (WLTP) will also be introduced in the future so that laboratory results can better represent actual vehicle performance on the road. However, the date of its introduction remains to be decided. This should help ensure more accurate reporting of emissions and fuel data, which will also provide better guidance to consumers and help them make informed decisions.   Air pollutants   In 2013, the EU transport sector contributed 13 % and 15 % of the total PM 10  and PM 2.5  primary emissions, respectively. While exhaust emissions from vehicles have fallen since 1990, reflecting advances in vehicle technologies such as particulate filters, in contrast, non-exhaust emissions of particulate matter from brake and tyre wear have increased. Today, these non-exhaust sources make up a large fraction of total vehicle particulate matter emissions — around half of PM 10  and a third of PM 2.5  emissions. In addition, emissions from international shipping within European seas contribute an additional 15 % of the total PM 2.5  emissions in the EU. This is notably a problem in major port cities.   Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) are the two main air pollutants from road transport. To limit exhaust emissions from passenger vehicles, the EU has introduced ‘Euro standards’ for various air pollutants, including NO x  and PM. Euro standards set different limits for petrol and diesel vehicles per pollutant and have become increasingly stringent over time. For example, a diesel car tested according to the latest ‘Euro 6’ technology is allowed to emit just 3 % of the particulate matter that a diesel car tested under the Euro 1 technology could emit 20 years earlier.   Such standards have been instrumental in reducing air pollution from transport. Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x )  [4]   from petrol cars have decreased significantly since 2000, although those from diesel cars have not decreased to the same extent.   Without effective after-treatment, diesel engines, in particular, are high emitters of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). NO 2  is a significant problem at ground level in urban areas, with the transport sector the largest contributor to emissions, accounting for  46 % of total NO x  emissions  in the European Union in 2013. The number of diesel vehicles on the road has been increasing in recent years, impacting air quality. Without this ‘dieselisation’, air quality in Europe would have improved further.   Discrepancies exist between real-world and test measurements of NO x .  ICCT studies  estimated that real-world NO x  emissions from diesel vehicles were on average seven times higher than the limits set by the Euro 6 standard. To help reduce this gap, the EU has recently agreed on a ‘Real Driving Emissions’ test procedure for NO x  emissions from new cars starting in 2017. Public awareness of the high on-road emissions of NO x  emissions has also greatly increased following the September 2015 revelations that Volkswagen used a so-called ‘defeat device’ in diesel cars to lower emissions during vehicle testing in the USA. The European Union and national authorities are currently carrying out investigations on the issue of vehicle emissions including the potential use of such cheat devices in Europe.         Clean energy for transport   Transport continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels, especially petrol and diesel. The impacts of transport on human health, the environment and climate change are closely linked to the choice of fuel. Clean alternative fuels, including electricity, are already available and can constitute viable options to petrol and diesel. Trip length plays a role in determining the suitability of the fuel type. For example, electricity might be more suited to passenger cars in urban settings or those travelling shorter-distances. The uptake of cleaner fuels also depends on the extent of the infrastructure and incentives offered to prospective owners (lower taxation, free tolls, etc.).   EU legislation  [5]   requires that each EU Member State meets 10 % of its transport energy consumption from renewable energy sources by 2020. The legislation identifies certain sustainability criteria and only those biofuels that comply with these criteria are considered ‘sustainable’ according to this legislation.   Moreover, the end product (electricity, biofuels, etc.) is not the only factor determining how environmentally sustainable a fuel is. The way the actual fuel is produced should also be taken into account. For example, electricity generated by wind power is certainly cleaner than electricity produced by coal. Transport’s demand for energy can be best addressed through a comprehensive analysis and vision for the entire energy system, taking into account the demand from all economic sectors and the supply potential from a mix of energy sources.

Sales of new passenger cars in the EU increased by 9 % in 2015 compared to the previous year, with a total of 13.7 million new cars registered. Recent data point to a growth in diesel consumption in road transport, up from 52 % of total road fuel consumption in 2000 to 70 % in 2014. Similarly, just over half of the vehicles sold in Europe are diesel, corresponding to 52 % of sales in 2015.

In terms of purely electric cars, the largest number of registrations was recorded in France (more than 17 650 vehicles), Germany (more than 12 350 vehicles) and the UK (more than 9 900 vehicles). Electric two wheelers have also become more common, especially for journeys within urban areas. Financial incentives, such as subsidies or preferential tax treatments (e.g. free parking in city centre, possibility to drive on bus lanes, free tolls, lower fuel or registration taxes), play a major role in the consumer’s choice of the type of car purchased. Transport and greenhouse gas emissions Motorised vehicles need the energy generated from fuel (e.g. petrol, diesel, electricity, natural gas, biofuels) to move. But the high temperature combustion of fossil fuels in engines releases air pollutants and CO2 into the atmosphere. Transport demand is closely linked to economic activity: in periods of growth, economic output goes up, more goods are transported and more people travel. The economic recession of 2008 resulted in lower transport demand and, consequently, in reduced greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the sector in the following years following. Despite this slow down period, the EU’s overall transport emissions in 2014 were 20 % higher[1] than their 1990 levels. In 2014, about a quarter of the EU’s total GHG emissions came from transport.[2] According to preliminary data, passenger cars contributed to 44 % of transport sector emissions, and heavy-duty vehicles and buses a further 18 %. Emissions from different transport modes varied substantially over time. International aviation emissions almost doubled and road transport increased by 17 % in this period, whereas emissions from rail transport and inland navigation declined by more than 50 % and almost 37 % respectively. Reduction targets The EU has set itself several targets to reduce GHG emissions from transport. In its White Paper published in 2011, the European Commission set a target of a 60 % reduction from 1990 levels by 2050. This means that current levels need to be reduced by two thirds. Transport also needs to contribute to the EU’s overall targets for GHG emissions reductions by 2020 and 2030. Part of the 2030 target will be achieved through the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Although it includes emissions from aviation, other transport emissions are excluded. This means that with the exception of intra-EU aviation, the remaining transport modes will need to contribute to the 30 % reduction effort for the sectors excluded[3] from the EU ETS. To achieve GHG emissions reductions in these non-ETS sectors, the overall EU effort is shared among Member States. Each country then decides how to achieve its national target. This is known as the Effort Sharing Decision and it will contribute to a ‘30% reduction by 2030’. Currently, around one third of the GHG emissions from non-ETS sectors come from the transport sector. The EU’s transport sector depends on oil for 94 % of its fuel, 90 % of which is imported. This makes it particularly vulnerable to instability and changes in the global energy market. A disruption in the energy supply could severely undermine the economy and hamper the quality of life in the EU. To this end, the EU aims to reduce its oil consumption in transport (including maritime bunkers) by 70 % by 2050 compared to 2008 levels. All these targets require reliable and effective monitoring and measuring systems to measure progress. The European Environment Agency helps evaluate progress through datasets, indicators and reports, including the annual transport and environment report TERM. Carbon dioxide from cars and vans To help reduce the EU’s overall GHG emissions, the EU has put in place increasingly stringent mandatory targets for average CO2 emissions for new passenger cars and vans. By 2015, new cars registered in the EU had to achieve the average emissions target of 130 grams of CO2 per kilometre (g CO2/km). This target was achieved two years ahead of the deadline. According to the latest EEA data, new cars registered in 2015 emitted on average 119.6 g CO2/km. The next target is set at 95 g CO2/km by 2021. Similar targets are set for light commercial vehicles (vans). New vans registered in the EU must meet the average emissions targets of 175 g CO2/km by 2017, and 147 g CO2/km by 2020. The 2017 target was achieved four years ahead of schedule. In 2015, average emissions for new vans amounted to 168.2 g CO2/km. Official test results show that vehicles are becoming more energy-efficient and are polluting less. However, there are concerns regarding the way emissions are measured. The targets set in EU legislation are based on a standardised procedure, which is necessary to compare between different models over time. The testing procedure currently used in the EU — the New European Driving Cycle — was introduced in 1970 and last updated in 1997. It no longer reflects real-world driving conditions in Europe. European traffic has changed considerably since then. Cars have become heavier and faster; roads more congested. The current procedure also allows manufacturers many flexibilities in testing parameters, such as vehicle mass, tyre pressure and adjustments to brakes. As a result of all these factors combined, cars and vans tend to emit significantly higher amounts of carbon dioxide on the road than in a laboratory under the current testing procedure. According to research by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), real-world emissions of CO2 are up to 40 % higher than emissions measured in the testing laboratory. Recognising such shortcomings, in January 2016, the European Commission proposed a number of changes to the current vehicle type-approval framework. These are designed to strengthen the independence of vehicle testing, and improve the enforcement and market surveillance regimes. A new emissions testing procedure known as the ‘Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure’ (WLTP) will also be introduced in the future so that laboratory results can better represent actual vehicle performance on the road. However, the date of its introduction remains to be decided. This should help ensure more accurate reporting of emissions and fuel data, which will also provide better guidance to consumers and help them make informed decisions. Air pollutants In 2013, the EU transport sector contributed 13 % and 15 % of the total PM10 and PM2.5 primary emissions, respectively. While exhaust emissions from vehicles have fallen since 1990, reflecting advances in vehicle technologies such as particulate filters, in contrast, non-exhaust emissions of particulate matter from brake and tyre wear have increased. Today, these non-exhaust sources make up a large fraction of total vehicle particulate matter emissions — around half of PM10 and a third of PM2.5 emissions. In addition, emissions from international shipping within European seas contribute an additional 15 % of the total PM2.5 emissions in the EU. This is notably a problem in major port cities. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are the two main air pollutants from road transport. To limit exhaust emissions from passenger vehicles, the EU has introduced ‘Euro standards’ for various air pollutants, including NOx and PM. Euro standards set different limits for petrol and diesel vehicles per pollutant and have become increasingly stringent over time. For example, a diesel car tested according to the latest ‘Euro 6’ technology is allowed to emit just 3 % of the particulate matter that a diesel car tested under the Euro 1 technology could emit 20 years earlier. Such standards have been instrumental in reducing air pollution from transport. Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx)[4] from petrol cars have decreased significantly since 2000, although those from diesel cars have not decreased to the same extent. Without effective after-treatment, diesel engines, in particular, are high emitters of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). NO2 is a significant problem at ground level in urban areas, with the transport sector the largest contributor to emissions, accounting for 46 % of total NOx emissions in the European Union in 2013. The number of diesel vehicles on the road has been increasing in recent years, impacting air quality. Without this ‘dieselisation’, air quality in Europe would have improved further. Discrepancies exist between real-world and test measurements of NOx. ICCT studies estimated that real-world NOx emissions from diesel vehicles were on average seven times higher than the limits set by the Euro 6 standard. To help reduce this gap, the EU has recently agreed on a ‘Real Driving Emissions’ test procedure for NOx emissions from new cars starting in 2017. Public awareness of the high on-road emissions of NOx emissions has also greatly increased following the September 2015 revelations that Volkswagen used a so-called ‘defeat device’ in diesel cars to lower emissions during vehicle testing in the USA. The European Union and national authorities are currently carrying out investigations on the issue of vehicle emissions including the potential use of such cheat devices in Europe.  Clean energy for transport Transport continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels, especially petrol and diesel. The impacts of transport on human health, the environment and climate change are closely linked to the choice of fuel. Clean alternative fuels, including electricity, are already available and can constitute viable options to petrol and diesel. Trip length plays a role in determining the suitability of the fuel type. For example, electricity might be more suited to passenger cars in urban settings or those travelling shorter-distances. The uptake of cleaner fuels also depends on the extent of the infrastructure and incentives offered to prospective owners (lower taxation, free tolls, etc.). EU legislation[5] requires that each EU Member State meets 10 % of its transport energy consumption from renewable energy sources by 2020. The legislation identifies certain sustainability criteria and only those biofuels that comply with these criteria are considered ‘sustainable’ according to this legislation. Moreover, the end product (electricity, biofuels, etc.) is not the only factor determining how environmentally sustainable a fuel is. The way the actual fuel is produced should also be taken into account. For example, electricity generated by wind power is certainly cleaner than electricity produced by coal. Transport’s demand for energy can be best addressed through a comprehensive analysis and vision for the entire energy system, taking into account the demand from all economic sectors and the supply potential from a mix of energy sources.

"transport-and-public-health  Transport and public health  Air and noise pollution from transport cause a wide range of health problems, with road transport and diesel vehicles in particular the biggest contributors. The European Union and its Member States are taking a series of measures to reduce the impact of transport on health with some success. Innovative solutions and local action can improve the situation further.   The World Health Organization (WHO) recently warned of health-threatening air pollution levels in major cities around the world. Just days into 2016, several European cities including  London  and  Paris  were affected by pollution episodes. Citizens were invited to change their behaviour by using public transport networks or car sharing in order to prevent the problem from worsening. Given specific meteorological conditions coupled with high pollutant emissions and projected extreme heat events linked to climate change, we can expect pollution episodes to become more frequent.   There is clear and increasing evidence of the health impacts that exposure to a whole range of air pollutants can have. Although only episodes of high pollution might be making the newspaper headlines, long-term and continued exposure to even low concentrations of air pollutants is much more harmful to human health.   The European transport sector has achieved significant reductions in the emissions of certain major air pollutants — mainly due to the introduction of emissions standards, financial measures and, to a lesser extent, alternative-fuels and transport avoidance measures. But more work is needed to continue to reduce pollution levels and meet European Union targets for 2030 and beyond. And, although it is the biggest culprit, it is not only the road transport sector that needs to reduce emissions — air, shipping and rail also contribute to air pollution and must not be ignored.      Similarly, noise pollution threatens human health and wellbeing, with road traffic again the most widespread contributor. While there have been reductions in air pollutants from transport, exposure to noise levels above accepted limit values has remained constant across European urban areas in recent years.   Health impacts of transport   The most recent figures for Europe show that, despite considerable emissions reductions in the last decade, more than 400 000 premature deaths  [1]   per year can be attributed to air pollution from all sources.   Individual air pollutants can cause a variety of health impacts. Nitrogen oxides, particulate matter (PM 10  and PM 2.5 ), sulphur oxides, carbon monoxide, and various heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and mercury are all emitted from the exhausts of vehicles. In addition, precursor chemicals in exhausts may react in the atmosphere giving rise to the formation of ozone. Finally, particulate matter and heavy metals are also released into the air as a result of tyre and brake abrasion and, once they have been deposited on the pavement may be ‘re-suspended’ in the air by passing cars.   Exposure to these pollutants can have very specific health impacts, but in general, the organs, nervous system and blood are affected, causing or aggravating ailments such as lung disease — leading to respiratory problems — heart attacks, asthma, anxiety, dizziness and fatigue.  [2]     Noise also has significant health impacts. Exposure during the night can cause sleep disturbance, leading to adverse health effects. Long-term exposure during an average day period can result in increased blood pressure and cardiovascular disease among other illnesses. As many as 80 % of Europeans are expected to be living in urban areas by 2020, with a large number of these near busy transport infrastructure and hubs such as airports and motorways.   An estimated 125 million Europeans (or one in four) are affected by noise levels from road traffic that exceed an average annual day, evening and night level of 55 decibels (55 dB L den ). Due to incomplete reporting, these numbers are likely significantly higher.   Measuring annoyance from noise   L  den   is a descriptor of noise level based on an energy equivalent noise level averaged over a whole day. It is designed to assess annoyance. The   Environmental Noise Directive   sets L  den   at 55 dB for noise mapping assessments and action planning. For assessing sleep disturbance in an exposed population, the directive recommends the application of an L  night   indicator, with a threshold of 50 dB.    Recent figures suggest that such exposure leads to 20 million Europeans experiencing annoyance from noise, as well as 8 million suffering sleep disturbance, 43 000 hospital admissions and at least 10 000 premature deaths. In addition, noise from aircraft movements in and around airports affects a considerable number of people, including school children — at least 8 000 of whom suffer reading impairment in Europe as a result of exposure to high noise levels.         Tackling air and noise pollution   Current European transport, air quality and noise legislation deals with air pollution and environmental noise, with a view to improving human health and the environment. European emissions standards ( Euro standards ) regulate emissions of pollutants from different types of vehicles. For example, the current Euro 6 standard, in force for new vehicles since 2014, sets emissions limits of particulate matter from petrol and diesel cars at 5 milligrams per kilometre (mg/km), a  fivefold reduction  compared to 2005 levels. Similarly, NO x  emissions limits are set at 80 mg/km for diesel cars and 60 mg/km for petrol cars, again, marking a considerable reduction since 2005.   Euro standards include specifications for vehicle testing but there are significant differences between official vehicle emissions (i.e. those recorded under test conditions) and real-world emissions. Measures are being taken to rectify this, including the development of new test specifications and the roll-out of  Portable Emissions Measurement  Systems (PEMS), which can be fitted to cars to measure on-road conditions.   To reduce harm from noise pollution, the EU has put in place different measures, including technical standards to limit noise emissions at source (e.g. EU tyre labelling to help consumers identify ‘quieter’ tyres). The Environmental Noise Directive complements such standards. It aims to improve the quality of data collected with a view to better managing the relationship between residents and traffic. The directive requires  action plans  to be drawn up for major transport sources and the largest urban areas, the aim of which is to reduce the impact of noise on the affected population — and reduce noise itself if necessary — as well as to protect quiet areas, i.e. those areas free from noise pollution. These action plans are currently in a third five year cycle, running until 2018.   In parallel with EU efforts, many local and regional initiatives are looking for innovative solutions to transport-related air pollution and noise problems. The ‘Ljubljana Step-by-Step Approach’ and Seville’s Big Bang’,  [3]   which ran between 2006 and 2013, are two such initiatives that favour cycling infrastructure development. Both have successfully reduced traffic congestion, improved air quality and lowered GHG emissions. In Seville, while the number of daily car journeys into the town centre dropped from 25 000 to 10 000 over the duration of the project, a 29 % drop in NO 2  and a 19.5 % drop in PM concentrations were measured. Meanwhile, in Ljubljana, the modal share of cycling as a proportion of total traffic rose by 20 % during the project. These figures indicate impressive results. Regarding improvements in health or noise reduction, there are no official data, although anecdotal evidence suggests noise levels dropped significantly in both towns.   Looking at the future   Given these legislative frameworks and innovative solutions, emissions of air pollutants from transport are expected to continue their decline across Europe, with positive impacts on human health. However, 87‒90 % of city dwellers in the EU are still exposed to  levels of air pollutants  deemed harmful by the WHO. In fact, by meeting these levels for PM 2.5 , it is estimated that  some 144 000 premature deaths  could be avoided. In the longer-term, Europe will need to further integrate policy measures and actions to reduce air pollutant emissions and create the conditions for better health and wellbeing of European citizens, and avoid the effects of pollution episodes such as those in London and Paris. Reducing pollutant emissions from transport could certainly help improve air quality, in urban areas in particular.   The situation for noise is even more challenging. Noise is a pervasive pollutant in Europe and continued economic growth, increased industrial output, expanding urbanisation and related transport needs will continue to threaten the quality of Europe’s soundscape. This will have an impact on the health of Europeans. Noise from road traffic will remain the biggest threat, while noise from airport activities will continue to affect those living nearby. Improved noise reporting is essential to build a more complete picture of the health impacts it brings about. Countries are encouraged to continue to develop their noise action plans, but the focus should also be on noise reduction at source — a far more efficient way of solving the problem.

"aviation-and-shipping-in-the-spotlight  Aviation and shipping in the spotlight  Flying off for a weekend break, cotton t-shirts made in Bangladesh, roses from Kenya… These are some of the products available to us in a well-connected, globalised world. Aviation and shipping contribute to economic growth, but they also lead to impacts on human health, the climate and the environment. Faced with future projections of growth, these two sectors have started to explore ways to reduce their impact.   Aviation and international shipping have helped to dramatically reduce distances and increase our access to cheaper holidays and goods. And they have helped to create millions of jobs at home and abroad due to increased trade and tourism.   Demand for the two sectors is expected to grow globally for more leisure, convenience and access to goods in the years ahead. Between 1995 and 2050, passenger transport in the EU, including aviation, is  expected to grow  by around 70 % and freight transport by 100 %. According to the International Transport Forum (ITF) at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, world freight volumes will also increase. This is partly due to projected growth in global trade. The ITF also foresees  geographical shifts  in trade patterns around the world, where growth in trade in emerging economies will lead to longer haulage distances.   While such growth is good for the economy, the upward trend in passenger flights and shipping poses an increased threat to the climate, the environment and human health. The aviation and maritime transport sectors are expected to see a rise in emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and air pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and sulphur oxides (SO x ), as well as noise pollution. Carbon dioxide emissions from the sectors currently represent 5 % of global emissions and, according to a  European Parliament study , aviation and maritime transport will be responsible for up to 22 % and 17 %, respectively, of global CO 2  emissions in 2050.   Up in the air   Flying is seen as a safe and convenient mode of transport. The number of flights in Europe in 2014 was about 80 % higher than in 1990. And after a drop due to the economic recession from 2008 onwards, the numbers are  picking up again .   Increased numbers are partly due to a general trend towards longer flights and aircraft with more seats. Most of the growth is due to increased business by low-cost flights, which have lured passengers away from traditional carriers and opened new routes contributing to growth in the sector. This trend is expected to continue as low-cost carriers expand their fleets and start offering trans-continental flights, giving travellers more choice and more destinations. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the UN agency which regulates the sector, projects that the world’s  commercial aircraft fleet  will jump to around 47 500 by 2036, from around 26 000 in 2016.   According to 2014 preliminary data compiled by the European Environment Agency shows that GHG emissions from international aviation increased by 22.7 % between 2000 and 2007, and then fell by 3.5 % between 2007 and 2014. Excepting the recent decline, emissions have been increasing steadily. They doubled since 1990 and were 18.3 % higher in 2014 than in 2000. And the upward trend is expected to continue.   The ecological footprint of a single person taking a long-haul flight causes as much pollution as a motorist does in two months according to  one study . In other words, a one-way transatlantic flight from Paris to New York in economy class generates around 381.58 kilograms of CO 2 , according to the ICAO’s  emissions calculator . This is equivalent to emissions generated by the energy use of an  average house for 10 days .   The extra noise created with increased numbers of take-offs and landings at airports also has a negative effect on health, creating more than just annoyance and sleep disturbance for people living nearby. Recent  research  on children’s exposure to aircraft noise found evidence of reduced academic achievement and health damage.   The aviation sector has addressed some of these issues by boosting fuel efficiency through improved engine and plane designs. However, the uptake of sustainable alternative fuels is very slow, and the recent collapse in global oil prices has eased the incentive on airlines to develop biofuel-based renewable fuels. Moreover, jet fuels used on international flights are also exempt from national taxes. Compared to fuels used in other heavily taxed transport modes such as road transport, this tax exemption makes the cost of flying relatively cheaper and the user does not pay for most of the negative impacts on the environment and climate.   Airlines are continuously upgrading their fleets. New planes are much more fuel-efficient and have quieter engines, but replacing the entire fleet by more fuel-efficient aircraft will take time. Newer aircraft fleets have led to reductions in emissions per passenger kilometre, but the pace of growth in recent years and projected growth in the years ahead mean that technological efficiency gains fall short of reigning in the absolute increase in total emissions from aviation.   Tourism and transport   The tourism sector depends on transport, while the demand in the tourism sector contributes to the growth in the transport sector. With raising income levels and decreasing holiday travel costs, more and more people aspire to ‘discover new places’. Globalisation and extensive transport networks potentially turn every location into a holiday destination. More than half of the international   tourist arrivals   in the world are for holidays and leisure trips.    Although the aviation and cruise sectors are growing, the largest share of trips by tourists is made by car.  [1]   However, air transport accounts for the largest share of tourism-related GHG emissions, while cruises remain the most GHG emissions-intense mode of transport per kilometre travelled. Furthermore, most cruises start with flights to reach harbours, adding between 10 % and 30 % to the total emissions caused by the cruise.  [2]      Europe is a major tourist destination. In 2007, the number of air passengers in Europe was estimated to be around 600 million, 400 million of whom were leisure passengers  [3]   In   2030, Europe is expected to have international tourist arrivals corresponding to almost 90 % of its population.       Highways of the sea   Thousands of cargo ships routinely travel long distances on the high seas to move millions of tonnes of goods between continents — everything from fresh fruits and television sets to grain or oil. The maritime transport sector plays a key role in Europe’s economy. Almost 90 % of the EU’s external freight trade is transported by sea making European businesses and consumers heavily dependent on goods imported from the rest of the world. Shipping is seen as the cheapest way to move goods around the world, but the sector remains a highly volatile one, prone to boom and bust economic cycles.   While the sector’s share of GHG emissions is lower than those of road transport or air freight, its environmental impact is nevertheless growing. The  shipping industry  is estimated to emit around 1 billion tonnes of CO 2  per year and this is projected to rise to 1.6 billion tonnes by 2050. The International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) latest figures show that if no action is taken, GHG emissions from shipping will increase by up to 250 % by 2050, representing 17 % of global emissions.   The sector is heavily dependent on fossil fuels to power its engines, in particular bunker fuel, which is a less refined, more polluting and cheaper mix of oils, including diesel oil, heavy fuel oil and liquefied natural gas.   As ships spend most of their time out at sea, the reporting and analysis of their emissions have been less precise. However, when sailing close to the coast, the impacts of the emissions are clear. The burning of bunker fuels emits sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, causing acid rain and generating fine particles. These pollutants are dangerous for both human health and ecosystems.   Air pollution is only one of the environmental impacts of maritime transport. The sector has faced pressure over recent decades to do more to prevent oil spills, and dumping of waste and other pollutants at sea. Passenger cruise liners have come under increased scrutiny for their environmental impact. Demand for cruises continues to rise, resulting in the construction of megaships, which can carry more than 5 000 passengers and more than 1000 crew, making them floating cities at sea. These ships create large amounts of sewage, garbage, wastewater and air pollution, which critics say poses increased risk to the environment.   Most harbours are not yet equipped to supply electrical power to ships. Consequently, ship engines or on-board generators are always kept running even when moored to meet the ship’s internal energy needs, which in turn worsens air quality in harbour cities. Furthermore, sensitive ecosystems, such as the Arctic and Antarctic or coral reefs, are facing the risk of damage due to increased tourist traffic via cruises.   Although there are no agreed and binding targets, the industry and the IMO have taken some steps to reduce GHG emissions and pollution. New operational measures like slow steaming, sulphur emission control areas, better routing and banning discharges in and around sensitive marine areas are being adopted, and new hull designs to improve fuel efficiency and safety are being embraced. They are also looking at the use of cleaner fuels, including biofuels, as well as electric hybrid propulsion. A new global cap on the amount of sulphur permissible in fuel will be introduced from 2020, limiting the amount of sulphur in fuel to 0.5 %. The EU already restricts sulphur from commercial shipping to 0.1 % in a zone that extends from the English Channel to the Baltic Sea.   Time for change?   Airlines and shipping companies acknowledge these measures will not be enough. The objective of the ‘Paris Agreement’ to limit global average temperature rise to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, and if possible to 1.5 °C, is not achievable without the full engagement of the international aviation and maritime sectors. Some of the stakeholders in these sectors are already taking action. For example, recognising the concerns linked to their ground operations, some airports are putting in place a series of measures not only to curb noise pollution and GHG emissions, but also to prepare the airport for climate change impacts. Currently,  92 European airports  participate in the Airport Carbon Accreditation Programme, 20 of which are carbon neutral.   For sector-wide action, however, the onus is now on the international regulatory bodies. For aviation, the focus has been on the ICAO, members of which are working to reach a climate deal this year. ICAO member states have already agreed to a goal of carbon-neutral growth by 2020 and the ICAO is currently working to bring a ‘global market-based mechanism’ (GMBM) or a global carbon-offsetting scheme online by 2020 to achieve the carbon-neutrality goal. The plan also includes the use of more efficient engines and biofuels. However, access to market instruments is not expected to lead to significant direct emissions reductions from the sector; it will rather enable aviation operators to off-set their increasing GHG emissions by making reductions in other economic sectors. In this case, emissions of air pollutants and noise are expected to continue to increase.   Similarly, the IMO is leading talks between shipping nations on limiting emissions. Several initiatives are on the table, including the creation of a global data collection scheme to improve information on emissions from maritime shipping, an emissions reduction target and a market-based system to achieve the target.   The European Union has already taken measures to slow the growth of emissions by airlines and shipping companies. The EU and EUROCONTROL (the international organisation managing pan-European air traffic) have also been pushing for a more efficient use of European airspace and air traffic management through the Single European Sky initiative. The EU has also worked with the industry on research programmes to make jet engines more environment-friendly in terms of noise and other pollution.   Starting in 2012, GHG emissions from flights within the European Economic Area  [4]   have been included in the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS). The EU exempted flights to and from non-European Economic Area countries up until the end of 2016 to give time for the ICAO to negotiate a global deal.   Similarly, the EU has pushed hard for the IMO to come up with a global approach to reduce pollution. The European Commission is pushing the IMO and industry to adapt new operational measures to improve the energy efficiency of existing ships and the design of new ones. Under a new EU monitoring, reporting and verification regulation, from 2018, large ships (over 5 000 gross tonnes) using EU ports will have to report their verified annual CO 2  emissions and other relevant information. The ships will have to monitor and report the amount of CO 2  emitted on journeys to, from and between EU ports and also when in EU ports. This reporting system is estimated to cut carbon emissions from journeys covered by up to 2 %.   There are also EU rules in force to tackle sulphur emissions in Europe’s coastal waters and harbours. A  European Parliament report  has also suggested the maritime transport sector look at finding alternative fuels and other renewable energies to power ships.   Carbon offsetting   Carbon offset programmes, introduced over a decade ago, allow consumers to buy carbon credits to ‘neutralise’ their travel emissions, or emissions produced by shipping. The initial public interest around carbon offsetting seems to have faded. Currently   only 2 % of international flights   are offset by passengers and this is not expected to rise in future, despite the fact that many airlines and cruise lines continue to offer the service.

And they have helped to create millions of jobs at home and abroad due to increased trade and tourism. Demand for the two sectors is expected to grow globally for more leisure, convenience and access to goods in the years ahead. Between 1995 and 2050, passenger transport in the EU, including aviation, is expected to grow by around 70 % and freight transport by 100 %. According to the International Transport Forum (ITF) at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, world freight volumes will also increase. This is partly due to projected growth in global trade. The ITF also foresees geographical shifts in trade patterns around the world, where growth in trade in emerging economies will lead to longer haulage distances. While such growth is good for the economy, the upward trend in passenger flights and shipping poses an increased threat to the climate, the environment and human health. The aviation and maritime transport sectors are expected to see a rise in emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and air pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx), as well as noise pollution. Carbon dioxide emissions from the sectors currently represent 5 % of global emissions and, according to a European Parliament study, aviation and maritime transport will be responsible for up to 22 % and 17 %, respectively, of global CO2 emissions in 2050. Up in the air Flying is seen as a safe and convenient mode of transport. The number of flights in Europe in 2014 was about 80 % higher than in 1990. And after a drop due to the economic recession from 2008 onwards, the numbers are picking up again. Increased numbers are partly due to a general trend towards longer flights and aircraft with more seats. Most of the growth is due to increased business by low-cost flights, which have lured passengers away from traditional carriers and opened new routes contributing to growth in the sector. This trend is expected to continue as low-cost carriers expand their fleets and start offering trans-continental flights, giving travellers more choice and more destinations. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the UN agency which regulates the sector, projects that the world’s commercial aircraft fleet will jump to around 47 500 by 2036, from around 26 000 in 2016. According to 2014 preliminary data compiled by the European Environment Agency shows that GHG emissions from international aviation increased by 22.7 % between 2000 and 2007, and then fell by 3.5 % between 2007 and 2014. Excepting the recent decline, emissions have been increasing steadily. They doubled since 1990 and were 18.3 % higher in 2014 than in 2000. And the upward trend is expected to continue. The ecological footprint of a single person taking a long-haul flight causes as much pollution as a motorist does in two months according to one study. In other words, a one-way transatlantic flight from Paris to New York in economy class generates around 381.58 kilograms of CO2, according to the ICAO’s emissions calculator. This is equivalent to emissions generated by the energy use of an average house for 10 days. The extra noise created with increased numbers of take-offs and landings at airports also has a negative effect on health, creating more than just annoyance and sleep disturbance for people living nearby. Recent research on children’s exposure to aircraft noise found evidence of reduced academic achievement and health damage. The aviation sector has addressed some of these issues by boosting fuel efficiency through improved engine and plane designs. However, the uptake of sustainable alternative fuels is very slow, and the recent collapse in global oil prices has eased the incentive on airlines to develop biofuel-based renewable fuels. Moreover, jet fuels used on international flights are also exempt from national taxes. Compared to fuels used in other heavily taxed transport modes such as road transport, this tax exemption makes the cost of flying relatively cheaper and the user does not pay for most of the negative impacts on the environment and climate. Airlines are continuously upgrading their fleets. New planes are much more fuel-efficient and have quieter engines, but replacing the entire fleet by more fuel-efficient aircraft will take time. Newer aircraft fleets have led to reductions in emissions per passenger kilometre, but the pace of growth in recent years and projected growth in the years ahead mean that technological efficiency gains fall short of reigning in the absolute increase in total emissions from aviation. Tourism and transportThe tourism sector depends on transport, while the demand in the tourism sector contributes to the growth in the transport sector. With raising income levels and decreasing holiday travel costs, more and more people aspire to ‘discover new places’. Globalisation and extensive transport networks potentially turn every location into a holiday destination. More than half of the international tourist arrivals in the world are for holidays and leisure trips.Although the aviation and cruise sectors are growing, the largest share of trips by tourists is made by car.[1] However, air transport accounts for the largest share of tourism-related GHG emissions, while cruises remain the most GHG emissions-intense mode of transport per kilometre travelled. Furthermore, most cruises start with flights to reach harbours, adding between 10 % and 30 % to the total emissions caused by the cruise.[2]Europe is a major tourist destination. In 2007, the number of air passengers in Europe was estimated to be around 600 million, 400 million of whom were leisure passengers[3] In 2030, Europe is expected to have international tourist arrivals corresponding to almost 90 % of its population.   Highways of the sea Thousands of cargo ships routinely travel long distances on the high seas to move millions of tonnes of goods between continents — everything from fresh fruits and television sets to grain or oil. The maritime transport sector plays a key role in Europe’s economy. Almost 90 % of the EU’s external freight trade is transported by sea making European businesses and consumers heavily dependent on goods imported from the rest of the world. Shipping is seen as the cheapest way to move goods around the world, but the sector remains a highly volatile one, prone to boom and bust economic cycles. While the sector’s share of GHG emissions is lower than those of road transport or air freight, its environmental impact is nevertheless growing. The shipping industry is estimated to emit around 1 billion tonnes of CO2 per year and this is projected to rise to 1.6 billion tonnes by 2050. The International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) latest figures show that if no action is taken, GHG emissions from shipping will increase by up to 250 % by 2050, representing 17 % of global emissions. The sector is heavily dependent on fossil fuels to power its engines, in particular bunker fuel, which is a less refined, more polluting and cheaper mix of oils, including diesel oil, heavy fuel oil and liquefied natural gas. As ships spend most of their time out at sea, the reporting and analysis of their emissions have been less precise. However, when sailing close to the coast, the impacts of the emissions are clear. The burning of bunker fuels emits sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, causing acid rain and generating fine particles. These pollutants are dangerous for both human health and ecosystems. Air pollution is only one of the environmental impacts of maritime transport. The sector has faced pressure over recent decades to do more to prevent oil spills, and dumping of waste and other pollutants at sea. Passenger cruise liners have come under increased scrutiny for their environmental impact. Demand for cruises continues to rise, resulting in the construction of megaships, which can carry more than 5 000 passengers and more than 1000 crew, making them floating cities at sea. These ships create large amounts of sewage, garbage, wastewater and air pollution, which critics say poses increased risk to the environment. Most harbours are not yet equipped to supply electrical power to ships. Consequently, ship engines or on-board generators are always kept running even when moored to meet the ship’s internal energy needs, which in turn worsens air quality in harbour cities. Furthermore, sensitive ecosystems, such as the Arctic and Antarctic or coral reefs, are facing the risk of damage due to increased tourist traffic via cruises. Although there are no agreed and binding targets, the industry and the IMO have taken some steps to reduce GHG emissions and pollution. New operational measures like slow steaming, sulphur emission control areas, better routing and banning discharges in and around sensitive marine areas are being adopted, and new hull designs to improve fuel efficiency and safety are being embraced. They are also looking at the use of cleaner fuels, including biofuels, as well as electric hybrid propulsion. A new global cap on the amount of sulphur permissible in fuel will be introduced from 2020, limiting the amount of sulphur in fuel to 0.5 %. The EU already restricts sulphur from commercial shipping to 0.1 % in a zone that extends from the English Channel to the Baltic Sea. Time for change? Airlines and shipping companies acknowledge these measures will not be enough. The objective of the ‘Paris Agreement’ to limit global average temperature rise to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, and if possible to 1.5 °C, is not achievable without the full engagement of the international aviation and maritime sectors. Some of the stakeholders in these sectors are already taking action. For example, recognising the concerns linked to their ground operations, some airports are putting in place a series of measures not only to curb noise pollution and GHG emissions, but also to prepare the airport for climate change impacts. Currently, 92 European airports participate in the Airport Carbon Accreditation Programme, 20 of which are carbon neutral. For sector-wide action, however, the onus is now on the international regulatory bodies. For aviation, the focus has been on the ICAO, members of which are working to reach a climate deal this year. ICAO member states have already agreed to a goal of carbon-neutral growth by 2020 and the ICAO is currently working to bring a ‘global market-based mechanism’ (GMBM) or a global carbon-offsetting scheme online by 2020 to achieve the carbon-neutrality goal. The plan also includes the use of more efficient engines and biofuels. However, access to market instruments is not expected to lead to significant direct emissions reductions from the sector; it will rather enable aviation operators to off-set their increasing GHG emissions by making reductions in other economic sectors. In this case, emissions of air pollutants and noise are expected to continue to increase. Similarly, the IMO is leading talks between shipping nations on limiting emissions. Several initiatives are on the table, including the creation of a global data collection scheme to improve information on emissions from maritime shipping, an emissions reduction target and a market-based system to achieve the target.

"eu-greenhouse-gas-emissions-at  EU greenhouse gas emissions at lowest level since 1990  European Union (EU) greenhouse gas emissions continued to decrease in 2014, with a 4.1% reduction in emissions to 24.4% below 1990 levels, according to the EUs annual inventory published today by the European Environment Agency (EEA).    The figures come from the  EU annual greenhouse gas inventory submitted to the  United Nations . In absolute terms, greenhouse gas emissions have decreased by 1383 million tonnes (Mt) in the EU since 1990,  reaching 4282 Mt of CO 2  equivalents in 2014 .    Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: 'It is positive that Europe has been able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions substantially since 1990. It is an important step towards reaching our 2030 and 2050 climate targets. To accelerate the transition towards a low-carbon society, we need to further boost our investments in technology and innovation aimed at reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.'      The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the 24-year period was due to a variety of factors, including the growing share in the use of renewables, the use of less carbon intensive fuels and improvements in energy efficiency, as well as to structural changes in the economy and the economic recession. Demand for energy to heat households has also been lower, as Europe on average has experienced milder winters since 1990, which has also helped reduce emissions according to  an analysis  linked to the inventory.   Other findings     The overall reduction of 24.4% in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 23% including international aviation, was accompanied by a 47% increase in gross domestic product (GDP).   GHG emissions decreased in the majority of sectors between 1990 and 2014. Emission reductions were largest for manufacturing industries and construction (-372 Mt), electricity and heat production (-346 Mt), and residential combustion (-140 Mt).   Not all sectors were able to reduce emissions. Road transport, responsible for the largest increase in CO 2  emissions, grew by 124 Mt from 1990-2014, and 7 Mt from 2013-14.   Emissions from international transport (aviation and shipping), which are not included in national totals reported to UNFCCC, also increased substantially between 1990 and 2014 (93 Mt).   Emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which is a group of GHG gases used in the production of cooling devices such as air conditioning systems and refrigerators, also increased (99 Mt).   EU GHG emissions were cut by 185 Mt between 2013 and 2014 (4.1%). The reduction in emissions was mainly due to lower heat demand by households due to the very warm winter in Europe. The increase in non-combustible renewables, particularly from wind and solar power also contributed to lower emissions in 2014.

"assessment  Total greenhouse gas emissions trends and projections        In 2014, EU-28 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 24.4 % below 1990 levels (excluding  Land use, land-use change and forestry  (LULUCF) and international aviation). The figure is 23 % if international aviation is included.    The Emissions Trading System (ETS) covers about 42 % of EU emissions. In 2014, ETS emissions were 24 % below 2005 levels.   In sectors not covered by the ETS, GHG emissions decreased by 12.9 % compared to 2005.   In 2013, all Member States where below their Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) target. The 2014 data seem to confirm this trend across the EU.    The EU is on track to reduce GHG emissions by 20 %  compared to 1990  by 2020.     greenhouse gas emissions target effort sharing greenhouse gas trends projections eu ghg inventory       CSI CSI010 CLIM CLIM050 010 050,EU progress towards the 2020 targets Under the Climate and Energy Package, adopted in 2009, the EU committed to a unilateral emissions reduction target of 20 % by 2020 compared to 1990, which corresponds to a 14 % decrease from 2005 levels. The main two instruments for achieving this target are:  the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which includes a sub-target of a 21 % reduction in emissions by 2020 compared to 2005 levels; the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD), which defines national targets for non ETS sectors (mainly households and services, emissions from transport, waste and agriculture) and includes an EU sub-target of a 10 % reduction in emissions by 2020 compared to 2005 levels.   In 2014, total EU GHG emissions under the scope of the EU's climate and energy package (including international aviation) are estimated to be 23 % below 1990 levels. Between 2005 and 2014, emissions covered by the EU ETS (which represents about 42 % of total EU GHG emissions) decreased by 24 % (more than 560 Mt CO2-eq), while GHG emissions not covered by the ETS decreased by almost 13 % during the same period (Fig. 3). The ETS sectors that experienced particularly large emissions decreases are cement clinker and lime. Emissions reductions from combustion installations, which represent more than 70% of all ETS emissions and are dominated by electricity generation, are largely due to changes in the mix of fuels used to produce heat and electricity; while the use of hard coal and lignite fuels in electricity generation declined in this period, electricity generation from renewables increased considerably. The reduction in emissions may also have benefited from improvements in transformation efficiency for electricity generation, which means that less primary energy was necessary to generate a constant quantity of electricity. The cement, lime and iron and steel sectors follow similar trends, with emissions increasing until 2007 and then decreasing. These emissions reductions were, to a large extent, driven by reduced production due to the economic crisis.  The progress of the ETS sector towards its 2020 target is further analysed in the 2015 annualEEA technical report 'Trends and Projections in the EU ETS' . Progress of EU countries towards their ESD targets Under the ESD, Member States are required to limit those GHG emissions that are not covered by the EU ETS for the period 2013 and 2020, by meeting binding annual limits. The annual targets  known as annual emissions allocations - follow a straight line between a defined starting point in 2013 and the target for 2020. The assessment of current progress towards the ESD targets compares the non-ETS emissions of each year with the annual national targets. According to the latest estimates by the EEA carried out in October 2015, in 2013 all Member States were below their national ESD targets. The 2014 data seem to confirm this trend across the EU (Fig. 4). National projections show that in most Member States, ESD emissions will remain below annual ESD targets until 2020. However, in four Member States (Austria, Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg) emissions in 2020 could exceed targets if no additional measures are implemented. In the second half of 2016, a better evaluation of progress to the 2020 targets will be performed on the basis of the latest information reported by Member States. The results of this evaluation, including a detailed assessment of progress towards climate and energy targets in the EU will bepresented in the EEAs 'Trends and Projections in Europe 2016' report.,Fig. 1reflects the historic trends and projected progress of European countries since 1990. According to thelatest official data published by the EEA in June 2016, GHG emissions in the EU-28 in 2014 amounted to 4 286 million tonnesCO2-equivalent (Mt CO2-eq) (4 421 Mt if CO2 from international aviation is included), reachingtheir lowest level since 1990. GHG emissions decreased in most sectors between 1990 and 2014, with the exception of transport (including international transport), and refrigeration and air-conditioning (Fig. 2). At an aggregate level, the biggest share of the emissions reductions during this 24-year period is split almost equally between industry and energy supply (jointly more than 1 000 Mt of emissions reductions). A combination of factors explain lower emissions in industrial sectors. These include improved efficiency in restructured iron and steel plants, substantial improvements in carbon intensity, and structural changes to the economy with a higher share of services and a lower share of more intensive industry in the total activity of this sector. The economic recession that started in the second half of 2008 and continued through to 2009 also had a substantial impact on emissions. For energy supply, improvements in the transformation efficiency of electricity and heat production, and the move towards less carbon intensive fuels at EU level have been the main reasons for the 28 % reduction of emissions.Important emissions reductions have been also achieved in the residential and commercial sectors, and agriculture.  On the negative side, CO2 emissions from road transportation increased by more than 120 Mt in this period; emissions increased steadily between 1990 and 2007, before decreasing until 2013 and increasing again in 2014. The overall increase was fully accounted for by a strong uptake of diesel and a decline in gasoline use. International aviation and shipping have also seen increased emissions since 1990, up by 97 % and 24 % respectively. Total transport, including international bunkers, accounts for about a quarter of GHG emissions in the EU. The second largest increase in the EU emissions came from hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) used in refrigeration and air conditioning equipment. This is the only group of gases with increased emissionssince 1990. CO2 emissions from biomass combustion have also increased significantly since 1990. These emissions, together with the net LULUCF emissions and/or removals, are not included in the national GHG emissions totals, in line with the UNFCCC Reporting Guidelines, but are reported as a memorandum item. Their increase highlights the rapidly increasing importance of bioenergy in replacing fossil fuel sources. Between 2013 and 2014, GHG emissions in the EU-28 decreased by 4.1 % and accounted for a net reduction of 185 Mt CO2-eq (183 Mt if international aviation is included). The decrease in total GHG emissions was driven by emissions reductions in the energy sector, particularly in electricity and heat production, and in the residential and commercial sectors. This was due to the warmer conditions in Europe in 2014 as well as to the increase in non-combustible renewables used for electricity generation. A detailed analysis of the 1990-2014 changes in GHG emissions is provided in the EEA technical paperAnalysis of key trends and drivers in greenhouse gas emissions in the EU between 1990 and 2014. According to the latestTrends and Projections report, published in October 2015, emissions are expected to continue to decrease to levels between 24 % and 25 % below those of 1990, which is below the EU's 20 % unilateral reduction target. Projections beyond 2020 show further decreases in EU GHG emissions. However, Member States expect that the pace of these reductions will slow down. Planned reductions will only bring EU emissions down to levels between 27 % and 30 % below those of 1990 by 2030. This is insufficient to achieve the 40 % reduction target for 2030."
"mapping-europe2019s-quiet-areas  Mapping Europes quiet areas  One-third of Europes countryside is potentially affected by noise pollution caused by human activity, according to a new report published today by the European Environment Agency (EEA). Protecting areas not yet affected by noise can bring significant environmental and health benefits, the report says.   Within the European Union, the Environmental Noise Directive (END; 2002/49/EC) defines quiet areas outside cities as those areas delimited by national authorities that are undisturbed by noise from traffic, industry or recreational activities. The report  Quiet areas in Europe: the environment unaffected by noise pollution,  provides a first mapping assessment of potential quiet areas in Europes rural regions. Approximately 18% of Europes area can be considered quiet, but 33% is potentially affected by noise pollution, the report finds.   The distribution of quiet areas is strongly related to population density and transport. Other factors such as elevation, distance from coastlines and land use also greatly influence the presence of human activity and noise. Countries with relatively low population densities, such as Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, have the highest proportion of quiet areas. The noisiest areas tend to be found in areas with higher population densities, such as Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Remote areas such as the Alpine region or near the Mediterranean coast also have a high proportion of quiet areas.          Around 27% of Europes protected Natura 2000 sites have large areas of quiet, although one fifth of protected sites are exposed to high levels of noise. Although some actions have been taken to protect quiet areas in the countryside, the report says more could be done to reduce noise pollution in these areas to protect human health and biodiversity. Such measures may include for example, the introduction of national or local legislation that restricts certain business or recreational activities in quiet areas.   The impacts of environmental noise   Environmental noise is one of the most pervasive pollutants in Europe.  An EEA 2014 assessment  estimated that at least one in four European citizens are exposed to noise from road traffic above EU thresholds, or a total of more than 125 million people. Harmful effects of noise pollution on humans include annoyance and sleep disturbance which can in turn result in more serious problems like hypertension or heart disease.   There is also increasing scientific evidence regarding the harmful effects of anthropogenic noise on wildlife. In nature, many species rely on acoustic communication for important aspects of life, such as finding food or locating a mate. Noise pollution can potentially interfere with these functions.   About this report   The report builds on the  Good practice guide on quiet areas , published by the EEA in 2014. That report proposed a method, the Quietness Suitability Index (QSI), allowing potential quiet areas to be identified in regions outside of cities and towns.   The present report further develops and applies the QSI methodology to put together a quietness index map for Europe as a whole and for individual EEA member countries. Such noise maps can help identify areas where action is needed to reduce noise, and to identify potential quiet areas which should be protected.   countryside pollution noise quiet areas quietness suitability index noise pollution natura 2000,Within the European Union, the Environmental Noise Directive (END; 2002/49/EC) defines quiet areas outside cities as those areas delimited by national authorities that are undisturbed by noise from traffic, industry or recreational activities. The report Quiet areas in Europe: the environment unaffected by noise pollution, provides a first mapping assessment of potential quiet areas in Europes rural regions. Approximately 18% of Europes area can be considered quiet, but 33% is potentially affected by noise pollution, the report finds. The distribution of quiet areas is strongly related to population density and transport. Other factors such as elevation, distance from coastlines and land use also greatly influence the presence of human activity and noise. Countries with relatively low population densities, such as Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, have the highest proportion of quiet areas. The noisiest areas tend to be found in areas with higher population densities, such as Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Remote areas such as the Alpine region or near the Mediterranean coast also have a high proportion of quiet areas.

"environmental-knowledge-of-the-future  Environmental knowledge of the future  The European environmental data landscape has changed considerably over the last four decades. The complex nature of environmental degradation calls for more systemic analysis and relevant data to underpin it. In recent years, the European Environment Agency’s work has increasingly included systemic analyses. The EEA will continue to identify emerging issues and help expand Europe’s environmental knowledge.   The first pieces of environmental legislation in the European Union (EU) entered into force more than four decades ago. Since then, EU Member States have been regularly collecting and reporting comparable data on a wide range of environmental issues from hourly pollutant concentrations in cities to seasonal measurements of bathing water quality. They also keep track of their greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, pollutants released from industrial facilities, the size and location of protected areas, etc. These data streams are essential for monitoring progress and ensuring an effective implementation of environmental legislation.   The technology used in collecting, reporting and analysing environmental data has developed remarkably in this period. We can now collect, store and process larger amounts of data. We can also interlink different data streams to draw increasingly more accurate analyses on what is happening and why it is happening. Models can estimate impacts of air pollution by plotting air pollutant concentrations against population density at given locations. Data from satellite observations, including those from the EU’s earth observation programme  Copernicus , can be combined with data reported by monitoring equipment on land and at sea. We can estimate current and future impacts of environmental degradation and climate change.   Common EU rules ensure data compatibility and facilitate data and information exchange across Europe. However, to understand environmental trends, it is essential to cooperate not only within the European Union but also at a wider European and international level. Thanks to its  Environmental Information and Observation Network  (Eionet) and European and international partners, the European Environment Agency is in a unique position to process environmental information and foresee future knowledge needs.   Need for more systemic analysis   Despite gaps in some areas, the current knowledge on the environment is impressive. Our understanding of specific issues has expanded over time. However, this enhanced understanding has also highlighted the need to look at the ‘bigger picture’— the need for more systemic analyses, looking at entire systems, such as the mobility system and the food system. Monitoring air pollutant concentrations takes us only up to a certain point. We cannot analyse and tackle air pollution without looking at transport, dieselisation of the vehicle fleet, agriculture, urban sprawl, and consumption patterns. The environment is complex and our knowledge base needs to factor in this complexity. It has become clear that we will increasingly need more systemic and cross-cutting knowledge in the future.   Systemic analysis constitutes the core of the EEA’s latest  European environment — state and outlook 2015 . With our work on  global megatrends , we have tried to assess the influence of global trends on Europe’s environment and vice versa. Thematic EEA reports also try to address the issue at hand within a wider systemic analysis.   This type of analysis often calls for a different type of data flows and data management, closely linking socio-economic data with environmental data. Furthermore, more and more data is collected by citizens and private companies. This may also require us to build new data partnerships between public and private, local and global data owners and collectors.    Turning environmental data into knowledge   In addition to data ownership and management issues, large amounts of data present another challenge: how to distil knowledge, policy-relevant knowledge in particular, out of large data flows. What do we need to know to improve the environment further? This reflection might lead to identifying new areas to monitor, others to discontinue or monitor less frequently. It might also require building new connections between data sets. Moreover, the knowledge needs of an urban planner may be very different from those of a European policy maker. How can environmental knowledge contribute to the management of complex systems like cities?   In close collaboration with partners, the EEA is contributing to Europe’s environmental knowledge base with systemic-integrated and thematic assessments. We do not only focus on past trends and current state, but also on emerging issues and future knowledge needs.   Ultimately, the impact of knowledge depends on whether it is used and how it is used. Knowledge needs to be accessible and relevant to bring about improvements in the environment. It also needs to be communicated to and used by those that can influence decision making processes.

"renewable-energy-key-to-europe  Renewable energy: key to Europe’s low-carbon future  The future looks bright for renewable energy sources which are playing an increasingly important role as Europe tries to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. We talked about the opportunities and challenges ahead for clean energy with Mihai Tomescu, energy expert at the European Environment Agency.   Do you think the European Union will achieve its 2020 target of meeting 20% of its final energy needs from renewables?   Based on the progress we have made so far, it is likely that the EU will meet that target. The EU’s consumption of renewable energy continued to grow year on year, reaching 16% of final energy consumption in 2014. This share is higher than the interim trajectory for Europe from the Renewable Energy Directive, so we are well on track today. At national level the picture is slightly more mixed, but a large majority of Member States are making good progress.   The increased consumption of renewable energy sources has been beneficial in many areas. The progress towards EU and national targets means that renewables are effectively displacing fossil fuels and supporting a structural shift towards clean energy. These promising developments can prepare European companies for entering new global energy sectors where significant growth is expected to occur. We also observe an increasing interest and support for clean energy sources in the wider public — a factor that could help accelerate the current energy transition. Despite these positive developments, we still have a lot of work ahead to make the energy transition happen.   Could the EU ever fully rely on renewable energy or would fossil fuels always have a role to play?   With the Paris Agreement, the world agreed to move towards a low-carbon future. The European Union had already set ambitious climate targets and to achieve our long-term decarbonisation objectives, renewables must meet at least 55 % to 75 % of our energy needs by 2050. Clearly, this is challenging, but I think it is feasible.     Renewables are key to long-term climate mitigation efforts and will play an increasing role in improving the EU’s overall energy security. Yet, our need for fossil fuels will likely continue for some time, even though our dependence on them has started to diminish. In addition to geopolitical risks, fossil fuels come with disproportionate external costs to society in the form of health and environmental damages.   While sustained low oil prices could have an impact on the cost-competitiveness of renewables, the long-term outlook for renewables is bright. Renewable energy technologies have become increasingly cost competitive. In many places renewables are already competing successfully with fossil fuel technologies at market prices. Besides, if energy prices were to internalise better the environmental impacts associated with energy generation and use, such as emissions to air, climate and water, renewables would clearly out-compete conventional technologies.   Is Europe playing a leading role in developing clean energy sources?   As the recent  EEA report  on the use of renewables in Europe shows, the EU has made significant contributions to the development of renewable energy technologies globally. During the period 2005–2012, Europe recorded the highest share in total new global investments in renewable energy sources, being surpassed by China only since 2013. In 2014, the EU-28 had the largest installed and connected solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity in the world – about three times as much as China – and the largest wind power capacity globally. However, the pace of investment in Europe has slowed down lately, while it is picking up in other parts of the world.   With regard to employment in the renewable energy sector, the EU is one of the key global players. In 2014, it had the second highest level of employment in the labour force in the area, behind Brazil. The largest employers in the EU renewables sector are the wind, solar PV and solid biomass industries. We have seen job losses in the solar PV and wind industries as competition from China continues to grow. Despite this, the share of renewable energy related jobs in the EU-28 workforce remain, to-date, larger than in China.   What are the challenges ahead?   First, the global landscape for renewables is changing rapidly. If Europe wants retain its first-mover advantage, it has to keep up its level of commitment. The fact that research and development funding in renewables has lately been stagnating hints at a potential to lose out on the breakthrough technologies of tomorrow. In this context, the International Energy Agency recommends tripling the current R&D; spending on clean-energy innovation.   Moreover, the internal EU energy market needs to be reformed to make it more efficient and capable of accommodating growing levels of intermittent renewable sources. Intermittent renewable energy sources such as solar PV and wind power feed electricity into the grid when climatic condition allow them. Under existent market rules, these energy sources are not able to get appropriate price levels and this will need to be addressed in the future. Improvements in efficiency, transmission, cross-border interconnection, energy storage and a more active role for demand side management will also be important for the energy transition.     How does the EEA ensure more effective use of renewable energy?   We provide regular assessments on the progress towards EU targets, supporting decision makers in Europe. Our reports also offer a state of play and we act as a clearing house for member countries through our  European environment information and observation network (Eionet)  on an annual basis, to identify and discuss issues related to renewable energy.

"communication-tools-can-foster-greener-behaviour  Communication tools can foster greener behaviour  Communication has a key role in supporting the implementation of environmental legislation, spurring public participation and can help foster environment-friendly behaviours to build a sustainable future. A European Environment Agency (EEA) study published today explores how communication can support legal and economic policy tools.   The EEA report  ‘Communication, environment and behaviour,’  acknowledges that integrating communication in environmental policy processes could improve implementation of legislation and ultimately contribute to facilitating a transition to a resource-efficient, green economy. Used alongside other policy tools, communication can prove to be a very effective — and in many cases, cost-efficient — policy tool.   Effective communication approaches can lead to higher trust in public institutions and can enhance public engagement in environmental decision-making. A better understanding of behaviour can help improve communication by public authorities and induce people to make more environment friendly choices.   Building public trust and support is essential to the success of European environmental policies, including the European Union’s long-term objective of living well within the limits of our planet  —  which involves building a sustainable, low-carbon economy by 2050. The ambitious objective will require a large scale societal transition and behaviour changes.   The study, which draws on communication experiences and best practices used by the network of communicators in environmental protection agencies across Europe, explores the role of communication in environmental policy, identifies emerging tools and approaches to communicate policy messages, and looks at recent research in behavioural science to assess how it can assist in communicating environmental policies. The study also includes a set of recommendations on how public policy communication can be improved for more effective results on the ground.   communication communication and environment environmental policy,The EEA report ‘Communication, environment and behaviour,’ acknowledges that integrating communication in environmental policy processes could improve implementation of legislation and ultimately contribute to facilitating a transition to a resource-efficient, green economy.

"ten-countries-continue-to-breach  Ten EU countries continue to breach National Emission Ceilings Directive limits  Air pollution from sources such as transport and agriculture is still being emitted above legal limits in 10 European Union (EU) Member States according to new data published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.   Under the  National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD)  (2001/81/EC), EU Member States have individual air pollutant emission limits, or 'ceilings', restricting emissions for four important air pollutants: nitrogen oxides (NO x ), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) and ammonia (NH 3 ).   As of 2010, all Member States are required to meet their emission ceilings, but preliminary 2014 data and final data for 2010-13 in the EEA’s new briefing ‘ NEC Directive reporting status 2015 ’ shows that a number of countries consistently breached their limits for NO x , NMVOCs and NH 3  in all these years.   The main reasons for the exceedances are emissions from road transport (NO x ) and agriculture (NH 3 ). Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), the harmful component of NO x , directly harms health as high concentrations can cause inflammation of the airways leading to respiratory conditions and cardiovascular disease. In addition, NO x  forms fine particulate matter and ozone in the atmosphere. Both pollutants have adverse effects on human health. NH 3 , which mainly stems from the use of fertilisers and the handling of animal manure, also forms particulate matter in the atmosphere. Moreover, both pollutants have impacts on ecosystems as they contain nitrogen.    Key findings     In 2014, 10 Member States reported emission data under the NECD that were above the ceiling for at least one pollutant.   Germany was the only Member State that exceeded three out of its four emission ceilings in 2014 (NO x , NMVOCs and NH 3 ).   Since 2010, 10 Member States have persistently exceeded their respective emission ceilings for NO x  (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland and Luxembourg), NMVOCs (Denmark, Germany, Ireland and Luxembourg) and NH 3  (Austria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain).   The SO 2  ceilings emissions were not exceeded by any Member State during the period 2010-2014.   The EU-28 as a whole did not exceed its aggregated emission ceilings for any of the four air pollutants in 2014.

While all EU Member States have reduced their emissions of air pollutants since 2010, ten countries still continued to exceed one or more of their national NECD ceilings in 2014. The EU-28 as a whole did not exceed its aggregated emission ceilings for any of the four air pollutants in 2014.      Comparison of Member State emissions with respective NECD ceilings   Table 1: EU Member State progress in meeting NECD emission ceilings       Notes:v' indicates that the emission ceiling has been attained;x indicates that the ceiling has not been attained.2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013: final data; 2014: provisional data. In some cases, the ceiling could have been attained on the basis of adjusted emission inventories as approved under the Gothenburg Protocol of the LRTAP Convention (see Box 1).  [4]  [5]   In particular for 2013 and 2014, the number of exceedances above the 2010 NECD emission ceilings would become fewer.      Nitrogen oxides (NO x )   Six Member States exceeded their NO x  emission ceilings in 2014. Austria and Luxembourg exceeded their NO x  ceilings the most, by 26 and 29 %, respectively. The largest emitters of NO x  in 2014 were Germany, the United Kingdom, and France. Between 2013 and 2014, 21 Member States reported emission reductions for NO x . The total reduction for the EU-28 between 2013 and 2014 amounts to 4.7%.   Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs)   In 2014, four Member States (Denmark, Germany, Ireland and Luxembourg) did not attain their ceilings. The highest exceedance in 2014, in percentage terms, was reported for Ireland (58%). The largest emitters of NMVOCs were Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. Between 2013 and 2014, 23 Member States reported emission reductions for NMVOCs. The total reduction for the EU-28 between 2013 and 2014 amounts to 3.1%.   Sulphur dioxide (SO 2 )   All Member States complied with the emission ceilings for SO 2 . The largest emitters of SO 2  were Poland, Germany and the United Kingdom. Between 2013 and 2014, 23 EU Member States reported emission reductions for SO 2 . The total reduction for the EU-28 between 2013 and 2014 amounts to 7.7%.   Ammonia (NH 3 )   Six Member States (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain) exceeded their NH 3  ceilings in 2014. The highest exceedance, in percentage terms, was reported for Germany (35%), the smallest for Austria (1 %). The largest emitters of NH 3  were Germany, France and Spain. Between 2013 and 2014, 11 EU Member States reported emission reductions for NH 3 . There was an increase of1.3% for the EU-28 between 2013 and 2014.   EU progress in meeting its emission ceilings   The EU itself has two different sets of emission ceilings for 2010 and onwards, as set out in the NECD. With respect to the aggregated emission ceilings set for SO 2 , NO x  and NMVOCs and NH 3 described in Annex I of the NECD, the final 2010-2013 and provisional 2014 emission data are lower than the respective 2010 ceilings (see Figure 1, table on T   otal emissions for compliance   and  interactive data viewer  ).    The stricter emission ceilings in Annex II of the NECD were designed to ensure that specific environmental objectives were met, such as targets limiting the acidification and eutrophication of European ecosystems. Annex II of the 2001 NECD does not include a ceiling for NH 3  emissions. The aggregated NO x  emission data for the 28 Member States of the EU were above the Annex II limit for the 2010 to 2012 period. Similarly the aggregated NMVOCs emissions were above the Annex II ceiling for 2010. In 2014, the EU-28 as a whole achieved all its Annex I and II emission ceilings.   Figure 1: EU progress in meeting emission ceilings set out in NECD Annexes I and II          Notes:Croatia joined the EU in mid-2013, therefore for the period 2010 to 2013 emissions and ceilings are shown for the EU-27. For 2014, emissions and ceilings are given for the EU-28.     The aggregated EU emissions for mobile sources are calculated based on data on fuel sold for 22 Member States and data on fuel used for 6 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom).    Reasons for exceedances of emissions ceilings   Emissions from road transport contribute approximately 40 % to the EU-28 emissions total. They are one of the main reasons for the large number of NO x  exceedances since 2010. NO x  reductions from this sector have been lower than originally anticipated over the last two decades, partly because transport has grown more than expected, and partly owing to the larger than expected growth in diesel vehicles producing higher NO x  emissions than petrol-fuelled vehicles.Furthermore, it is widely accepted that real-world emissions, particularly from diesel passenger cars and vans, generally exceed the permitted European emission (Euro) standards which define the acceptable limits for exhaust emissions of new vehicles sold in the EU Member States.   Six Member States continue to exceed their respective NH 3  ceilings. About 94 % of NH 3  emissions stem from agriculture, mainly from the handling of animal manure and the use of fertilisers. NH 3  emissions have decreased since 1990, but not to anywhere near the same extent as the other pollutants covered by the NEC Directive. A number of technical measures exist to reduce NH 3  emissions. A main reason in countries with high or even rising NH 3  emissions is an increasing number of pig or poultry facilities, without implementing measures and/or technologies to limit emissions.   Box 1: Adjustments to emission inventories under the Gothenburg Protocol of the LRTAP Convention   In 2012, the Executive Body of the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP)    [6]    decided that countries improving their emission inventories by incorporating previously unknown emission sources or increased emission factors should not be penalised when compliance was subsequently judged against fixed national ceilings. An adjustments procedure was subsequently agreed under the Convention, allowing changes to emission reduction commitments, or to inventories, for the purpose of comparing total national emissions with them.    The adjustments process encourages Parties to incorporate the latest science in their national emission inventories, and to incorporate scientific updates included in the latest versions of the  EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook  .    [7]    Some countries have subsequently updated their emission inventories by applying new approaches recommended in the latest guidebook version. This has led, in some instances, to higher national emission totals. However, not all countries have yet included, for example, information on new emissions sources, meaning that the reporting from these countries is considered incomplete.    In 2014 and 2015, adjustment applications by Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Spain were approved under the Gothenburg Protocol, addressing NO  x  , NMVOCs and NH   3   . Countries that have signed, but not ratified the protocol, for example Austria and Ireland, cannot apply for adjustments.    [5]    Had adjusted emissions also been applied under the NECD, the following Member States would not have exceeded their ceilings: Belgium NO  x  , 2010-2014 and NMVOCs, 2010; Denmark, NMVOCs, 2011-2014 and NH   3   , 2012-2014; France, NO  x  , 2014; Germany, NO  x  , 2014 and NMVOCs, 2010-2014; Luxembourg, NO  x  , 2013-2014.

It leads to more than 400 000 premature deaths each year, shortening lifespans and contributing to serious illnesses such as heart disease, respiratory problems and cancer. It also causes soil and surface water acidification, harms crops and leads to grassland species loss due to eutrophication.[1] Under the National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD),[2] EU Member States have individual air pollutant emission limits, or 'ceilings', restricting emissions for four important air pollutants: nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and ammonia (NH3). As of 2010, all Member States are required to meet their emission ceilings. This briefing presents the latest preliminary emissions data reported by Member States for 2014 as well as final data for the preceding years  2010 to 2013. It also presents progress of the European Union (EU)[3]in meeting its aggregated ceilings as specified in the NECD. A number of Member States exceeded their emissions ceilings for NOx, NH3 and NMVOCs during the period 2010 to 2014. While all EU Member States have reduced their emissions of air pollutants since 2010, ten countries still continued to exceed one or more of their national NECD ceilings in 2014.

"resource-efficiency-in-europe-benefits  Resource efficiency in Europe: benefits of doing more with less  Many European countries are realising the economic benefits of making more efficient use of material resources like metals, fossil fuels and minerals. But more action is needed to underpin this trend in resource efficiency with stronger policies on energy, material resources, waste management and on circular economy. These are the findings from a new European Environment Agency (EEA) assessment published today.   The EEA report  More from less – material resource efficiency in Europe , takes an in-depth look at national approaches and policies on resource efficiency and explores similarities and differences in related policies, strategies and targets. The report builds on a survey, in which 32 of the 39 EEA member and cooperating countries took part. Countries provided detailed information on their resource efficiency polices and examples of good practice initiatives.   The main objective of the report is to encourage countries to share information and their experiences in the development of resource efficiency policies. The work contributes to broadening know-how on resource efficiency and the circular economy and increases understanding of policy approaches in these areas.   Between 2000 and 2014, resource use in the European Union as a whole fell both in absolute terms (down by 12%) and per person (from 15.5 to 13.1 tonnes per person), according to the survey. The economic benefit of improving resource efficiency is the most important driver in many countries, indicating that the logic of doing more with less has been widely embraced. The most recurrent drivers to improve efficiency were the desire to increase competitiveness, to secure the supply of raw materials and energy and reduce dependence on imports, and to lower pressures on the environment.   The report stresses that the key challenge will be to ensure that the recent gains in efficiency are sustained, and that the situation does not revert to the long-term pattern of economic growth accompanied by increasing resource use. The survey also concludes that there is room for improvement in policy design and implementation, as well as significant potential benefit in the exchange of good practice, since big differences between countries still exist.   The  report and the accompanying 32 individual country profiles  were produced together with the Agency’s network of member and cooperating countries, known as  Eionet  and the  European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy (ETC/WMGE) .    Key Findings:     Only three countries, Austria, Finland and Germany, adopted dedicated national strategies for material resource efficiency. Two further countries have dedicated strategies at a regional level, in Flanders (Belgium), and Scotland (United Kingdom).       Most of the improvements in resource productivity occurred between 2007 and 2014, although not necessarily as a result of a comprehensive policy intervention. The gains were mostly due to the sharp decline in construction activity as a result of the economic crisis that started in 2007-2008, which led to huge falls in material use, but had rather limited impact on gross domestic product.       A majority of countries (26) identified certain waste streams and secondary materials as the most common group of priority materials. Key waste streams are plastic and packaging (17 countries), construction and demolition waste (16 countries), and food waste (15 countries). Energy sources, like fossil fuels and including renewables, were mentioned by 18 countries as priority resources.       Manufacturing was singled out most frequently as the key economic sector for improving material resource efficiency, followed by agriculture and forestry, construction, and waste management.       The service sector — currently accounting for some 70–75 % of GDP in most European countries — is potentially significant with respect to material use and the resource efficiency of the economy. However, very few countries mentioned service-oriented sectors among their priorities for improving material resource efficiency.       Nine countries have adopted national targets for material resource efficiency: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia. In most cases, these targets are based on gross domestic product relative to domestic material consumption (GDP/DMC) — the EU's lead resource productivity indicator.       Germany, the Netherlands, and the region of Flanders (Belgium) reported having a dedicated circular economy strategy, which aims to create a production and consumption system that generates little waste and keeps materials in use for as long as possible. Several countries acknowledge the need to move away from the current linear economic model and stated that the circular economy and closing material loops are already policy priorities. The majority of reported policy initiatives related to the circular economy focus on waste management, with only a few examples going beyond increasing recycling rates and a higher use of secondary raw materials.     material resources circular economy resource efficiency roadmap material resource use material recycling material resource efficiency waste low carbon economy,The EEA report More from less – material resource efficiency in Europe, takes an in-depth look at national approaches and policies on resource efficiency and explores similarities and differences in related policies, strategies and targets.

"better-targeted-measures-needed-to  Better targeted measures needed to tackle urban sprawl in Europe   There is growing evidence that urban sprawl is having an increasingly negative effect on the environment and on the quality of life across Europe. Existing actions to prevent, contain or control such development have had limited results. Better targeted measures are necessary. That is the main conclusion of a joint European Environment Agency (EEA) and Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) report published today.   The report,  Urban sprawl in Europe , reviews the low-density and scattered expansion of many cities that often comes as a result of uncontrolled growth, which has continued in Europe over recent decades. Urban sprawl involves the expansion of large urban areas into surrounding undeveloped areas including the countryside and agricultural land. According to the report, the level of sprawl increased in all European countries in the 2000s and it continues to grow. The report underlines the need for better policy measures and knowledge tools to address urban sprawl’s negative impacts. The report aims to support more sustainable political decision making and better urban planning across Europe.   Impacts of urban sprawl   While scattered housing and commercial developments have been associated with a number of positive economic and social effects, it also has negative ones, including ‘detrimental and long-lasting effects’ on the environment. The study says that urban sprawl contributes significantly to the loss of fertile farmland, soil sealing and the loss of essential ecological functions. The increase in built up areas has led to higher greenhouse gas emissions, higher infrastructure costs for transport, water and electricity, and the loss of open landscapes. It has also reduced the size of wildlife habitats as urban development and roads break up the landscape into ever-smaller pieces, with potentially devastating consequences for biodiversity and ecosystems.   Urban sprawl also has socio-economic impacts. It increases the demand for infrastructure such as roads, and it makes people more dependent on cars which poses a burden on household budgets. Urban sprawl also has a cascading effect on daily life in areas with low level of services and health in terms of air pollution, stress and accidents.          The study stresses that there is a need to encourage positive development methods like improving the density of existing residential areas within cities to better contain or reduce sprawl, rather than encouraging dispersed urban development that promotes outlying building zones, which lead to new traffic and transport bottlenecks.   Dispersed urban development can lead to a negative circular pattern, where the constant expansion of road networks is used to offset the traffic urban sprawl can cause, and where new roads lead to more sprawl, creating a locked-in development loop.   Four essential measures should be reinforced to support policy interventions:     Better monitoring of urban sprawl,   Applying a ‘sprawl analysis’ as a tool in urban, regional and transport planning to assess consequences of projects and zoning,   Setting up targets, limits and benchmarks to control sprawl,   Strengthening regional planning to encourage sustainable land use.     Key findings     The two largest clusters of high urban sprawl in Europe are located in north-eastern France, Belgium, the Netherlands and part of western German and in the United Kingdom between London and the Midlands.   Urban sprawl is most pronounced in wide rings around city centres, along large transport corridors and along many coastlines, particularly in Mediterranean countries. Lowest levels of sprawl are mainly found in mountain ranges or remote areas.   Best practices to keep urban sprawl in check or compensate by re-use of already developed land can help reduce land uptake and prevent urban sprawl. Countryside can be preserved through functional zones and spatial plans that determine housing limits and offer for stakeholder consultation, as well as the creation of public green areas with building restrictions.   More in-depth research is needed on urban sprawl, notably on how it developed over time, the history and the political and economic conditions that led to its development, and a deeper statistical analysis of the drivers of urban sprawl.   A variety of factors such as a higher income, possession and use of cars, the preference for detached housing, and a change in lifestyle or demography, drives the proliferation of urban sprawl. Political drivers play a key role. Policies have the power to prevent or moderate urban sprawl.   The report analyses in detail a significant and illustrative period, 2006-2009, which saw urban sprawl increased by 5% in the three years or by 1.7% per year, according to a calculation using the weighted urban proliferation method.     Methodology   The report investigated the degree of urban sprawl in 32 countries in Europe  in 2006 and in 2009 , and assessed the problem based on data taken at three levels: national, regional and at the 1-km 2  cell level. The analysis used the so-called ‘weighted urban proliferation’ method which quantifies the degree of urban sprawl for any given landscape taking into account the size and dispersion of built-up areas, and the uptake of built-up area per inhabitant or job. By offering new analytical approaches, the report presents advanced contribution to the methods of land monitoring.

The report analyses in detail a significant and illustrative period, 2006-2009, which saw urban sprawl increased by 5% in the three years or by 1.7% per year, according to a calculation using the weighted urban proliferation method.  Methodology The report investigated the degree of urban sprawl in 32 countries in Europe in 2006 and in 2009, and assessed the problem based on data taken at three levels: national, regional and at the 1-km2 cell level. The analysis used the so-called ‘weighted urban proliferation’ method which quantifies the degree of urban sprawl for any given landscape taking into account the size and dispersion of built-up areas, and the uptake of built-up area per inhabitant or job. By offering new analytical approaches, the report presents advanced contribution to the methods of land monitoring. Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN)"
"assessment  Atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations     Global average concentrations of various greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continue to increase.   The concentration of CO 2 , the most important greenhouse gas, increased to 397 parts per million (ppm) in 2014 an increase of 119 ppm (43 %) compared to pre-industrial levels.   The total concentration of all greenhouse gases, including cooling aerosols, reached a value of 441 ppm in CO 2  equivalents in 2014  an increase of about 3 ppm compared to 2013, and 34 ppm compared to totals measured more than 10 years ago.    The current total concentration of all greenhouse gases implies that the long-term probability of exceeding the 1.5C temperature increase, compared to pre-industrial levels, is already more than 50%. The atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration level that would be consistent with limiting global mean temperature increase to less than 2C could be exceeded over the next decades, unless greenhouse gas emissions are significantly reduced.      climate change csi greenhouse gases kyoto protocol ghg concentrations     CSI CSI013 CLIM CLIM052 013 052,Greenhouse gas concentration levels in the atmosphere have increased during the 20th century and the first part of the 21st century, mainly as a result of human activities related to the use of fossil fuels (e.g. for power generation), agricultural activities and land-use change (mainly deforestation) (IPCC, 2013, see also Carbon Budget at Global Carbon Project, www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/index.htm). The increase in all greenhouse gases has been particularly rapid since 1950. In 1970, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations reached a level some 50 ppm above pre-industrial level recorded more than 200 years ago. The second 50 ppmincrease took only around 30 years. Each greenhouse gas (Text box 1) affects the climate system differently. To evaluate greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere in relation to temperature change, it is important to consider all gases, i.e. the long-living greenhouse gases included in the Kyoto Protocol, those in the Montreal Protocol (direct and indirect), as well as ozone, water vapour and aerosols (IPCC, 2013). Text box 1: Greenhouse gases and their inclusion in internationallegislationGreenhouse gases can intercept solar radiation and, therefore, affect the climate system. In order to control the emissions of such gases, many of them are included in different international agreements, including the UNEP Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (1987) and the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC, which aims to limit global warming (1997).- Greenhouse gases included in the Kyoto Protocol (KPG) are: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and three (groups of) fluorinated gases; hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).- Greenhouse gases in the Montreal Protocol (MPG) cover three other groups of fluorinated gases: chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) and methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3).- In addition, there are also other forcing agents and greenhouse gases that are not included in global treaties but are dealt with at a regional level (e.g. the UNECE Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution), here called non-protocol gases (NPG), including tropospheric ozone (O3), and aerosols such as black carbon, sulphate and water vapour. Total greenhouse gas concentration and its relevance The total CO2 equivalent concentration of all greenhouse gases reached 441 ppm in 2014, an increase of 3.3 ppm compared with 2013, and 34 ppm compared with 2004 (Figure 1). The CO2 equivalent concentrations can be assessed in the light of the 2015 Climate Agreement in Paris. The objective of this agreement is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels (UNFCCC, 2015). The CO2 equivalent concentration can be defined so as to correspond to a specific equilibrium warming (i.e. the long-term temperature increase). Table 1 shows that the current total atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration already exceeds that which would keep long-term warming below the temperature threshold of +1.5oC. A concentration level of 480 ppm CO2 equivalents is likely (= 67 % probability) to limit long-term global temperature increase to less than 2oC (Table 1). This level is only about 40 ppm higher than the current concentration level. Assuming that the 20042013 trend of annual increase in total greenhouse gas concentration (i.e. 3.3 ppm per year) will continue in the coming years, this 480 ppm threshold will be exceeded within the next 11 years (Table 1). A 50 % likelihood (about as likely as not) of keeping the increase in the global average temperature below 2 C corresponds with a concentration of 530 ppm CO2 equivalents (IPCC, 2013). Under a continuation of current trends, this level will be reached in less than 30 years. Table 1: Long-term concentration levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere consistent with keeping the global average temperature increase below 1.5 C and 2 C, for various probability levels. The number of years within which these concentrations could be exceeded are provided in brackets, given the trend of the past 10 years (source, IPCC, 2013; Meinshausen et al., 2009):    Probability of staying below target  1.5C  2C    67 % (likely)   Not calculated   480 ppm (11 years)     50 % (about as likely as not)   430 ppm(exceeded in 2012)   530 ppm(27 years)     10 % (unlikely)   530 ppm(27 years)   650 ppm(63 years)     Long-term data sets on tropospheric ozone concentrations are difficult to develop, due to the scarcity of representative observation sites with long-term records and the large spatial heterogeneity (IPCC, 2013). Furthermore, note that for the total equivalent greenhouse gas concentration values presented, new estimates on the climate forcing of aerosols have been used (IPCC, 2013). Overall, aerosols have a cooling effect, although certain aerosols (e.g. black carbon) have a warming effect. The cooling effect is now estimated to be 0.4 watts per square metre (W/m2) smaller (i.e. more warming) than previously thought, mainly due to the greater warming potential of black carbon (see also the section on uncertainty). Relevance of individual gases An assessment of the contribution by the various groups of greenhouse gases has shown that the NPGs compensate for nearly 20 % of the current forcing induced by the KPGs and MPGs. The MPGs, as a group, contribute about 9 % to current forcing (Figure 2). Concentrations of these gases peaked around 2000and have been declining ever since, due to natural removal processes (IPCC, 2013). Most of the forcing is caused by KPGs, especially CO2. The average annual CO2 concentration reached 397 ppm in 2014 (Figure 3). This is an increase of more than 119 ppm (43%), compared to pre-industrial levels (i.e. before 1800) (NOAA, 2015). Overall, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere exceed the range of concentrations as recorded in ice cores over the past 800 000 years (IPCC, 2013). The average annual concentration of methane (CH4)  the second most important greenhouse gas  reached 1 822 parts per billion (ppb) in 2014, increasing by a factor of 2.4 compared to pre-industrial levels (Figure 3). CH4 concentrations in the atmosphere were relatively stable between 2000 and 2006, but have been steadily increasing again since 2007. The exact drivers of this increase are still debated (IPCC, 2013). The nitrous oxide (N2O) concentration was 327 ppb in 2014, 20 % above the pre-industrial level (Figure 3). The group of fluorinated gases (F-gases) within the scope of the Kyoto Protocol can be categorised as HFCs, PFCs and SF6. The HFC group, in particular, is very broad. Concentrations of these F-gases have increased substantially over recent decades. Their contribution to current climate forcing is currently still limited, although steadily increasing (from 0.5 % in 1990 to 0.8 % in 2004, and 1.3 % in 2014, see Figure 2). Their contribution is expected to continuously increase in the near future, due to the long lifetimes of most F-gases (in some cases more than 1 000 years) and to the increase in the emissions of new HFCs such as HFC-134a (a substitute for CFCs, used because they do not have an ozone depleting impact in the stratosphere)."
"forty-years-of-investments-have  Forty years of investments have improved Europe’s bathing water  bathing swimming water e-coli faecal contamination bathing water directive bathing water bathing water quality faecal bacteria sewage          The European Union’s efforts to ensure clean and healthy bathing water began forty years ago when the first Bathing Water Directive was issued. The annual bathing water report published today proves the value of the legislation and the years of investment in waste water infrastructure and other pollution reduction measures. It shows that bathing water quality has improved continuously over time leading to ninety-six per cent of monitored bathing sites in the EU meeting the minimum standards for water quality in 2015.     The annual bathing water report  from the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Commission assesses bathing water quality in 2015, indicating where it is expected to be good in 2016.   The report compiles analyses of water sampled at more than 21 000 coastal and inland bathing sites across the EU, Switzerland and Albania indicating whether or not it has been contaminated by faecal pollution from sewage or livestock.   While 96 % of bathing sites met the minimum requirements, more than 84 % met the more stringent ‘excellent’ level. Several large tourist areas and cities like Blackpool, Copenhagen and Munich are also starting to benefit from investments in improved sewage systems, which are leading to cleaner bathing sites at harbour areas, urban river locations and nearby beaches.   Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, said: “European bathing water is at 96 % acceptable and 84 % excellent standards. That is the result of 40 years investing in water and waste water infrastructure. It is a sign of EU legislation working well. And it is a perfect testimony to the fact that a highly evolved economic area such as ours can produce equally high environmental standards.”   Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: “Our assessment shows that bathing water quality has improved remarkably over the years. More and more bathing waters have not only reached the minimum requirements, but have improved to excellent standards. In some cities, people can even enjoy swimming in public harbour baths.”   Overall bathing water  has improved over time.  In 1991, 56 % of bathing water sites reached the highest standards. This percentage rose to 87 % in 2015, based on nearly 9 600 bathing water sites that have been monitored every year during this period.   Other key findings     More than 90 % of bathing sites in eight Member States had excellent water quality in 2015: Luxembourg (all 11 reported bathing water sites), Cyprus (99.1 % of bathing water sites), Malta (97.7 %), Greece (97.2 %), Croatia (94.2 %), Italy (90.6 %), Germany (90.3 %) and Austria (90.2 %).   Across Europe, only 385 bathing sites were assessed as having  poor bathing water quality in 2015.  The share of bathing water sites rated ‘poor’ dropped to 1.6 % in 2015 from 1.9 % in 2014.   The highest numbers of bathing sites with poor water quality were found in Italy (95 bathing sites, 1.7 %), France (95 bathing sites, 2.8 %) and Spain (58 bathing sites, 2.6 %).    The share of bathing water with excellent quality increased from 78 % in 2011 to 84 % in 2015.      Background   For recreational activities such as swimming, faecal contamination is a cause of concern for public health. Swimming at contaminated beaches or bathing lakes can result in illness. The major sources of pollution are sewage and water draining from farms and farmland. Such pollution increases during heavy rains and floods due to sewage overflow and polluted drainage water being washed into rivers and seas. Forty years ago, large quantities of uncontrolled, untreated or partially treated wastewater were discharged into many of Europe’s waters.   The 2015 bathing season was the first time that all EU Member States monitored their bathing sites according to the provisions of the EU's revised Bathing Water Directive (2006/7/EC). The directive specifies if the bathing water quality can be classified as ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘sufficient’ or ‘poor’ depending on the levels of faecal bacteria detected.   The outcome of the report will also be in focus during  #EUGreenWeek , 30 May - 3 June 2016, as part of the event's broader theme this year, 'Investing for a greener future'.

"reduction-of-co2-emissions-from  Reduction of CO2 emissions from new vans slowed in 2015  The fuel efficiency of new vans registered in the European Union (EU) increased slightly in 2015 compared to the previous year. Average emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) fell by less than 1 gramme (g) of CO2 per kilometre, according to preliminary data published today by the European Environment Agency (EEA). This is the smallest annual reduction since monitoring of emissions from new light commercial vehicles started in 2012.   The average van registered in 2015 emitted 168.2 g CO 2 /km which is 0.9 g less than in 2014. While the reported annual reduction is small, emissions are nevertheless well below the EU’s 2017 target of 175 g CO 2 /km. This target was already met in  2013 . Further efficiency improvements still need to be achieved to reach the EU’s more stringent target of 147 g CO 2 /km set for 2020.   Key findings:      In 2015, 1.5 million new vans were registered in the EU, an increase of 2 % compared to the previous year. More new vans were sold in most Member States. However, three Member States reported lower sales: Poland (-24 %), Spain (-16 %) and France (-12 %).   Three out of five new vans (i.e. 60 %) registered in the EU were sold in just three Member States: the United Kingdom (24 %), France (21 %) and Germany (15%).   The average fuel-efficiency of new vans varied widely across Member States due to the different models and sizes of vehicles sold in each country. Average emissions were lowest in Portugal (141.7 g CO 2 /km), Cyprus (143.2 g CO 2 /km) and Bulgaria (143.9 g CO 2 /km) and highest in Slovakia (186.6 g CO 2 /km), Germany (186.4 g CO 2 /km) and the Czech Republic (182.6 g CO 2 /km).   The average weight of vans sold also varied across countries. Smaller vehicles were sold in Malta, Bulgaria and Portugal (< 1 585 kg); larger vehicles (>1 940 kg) in Poland, Finland and Slovakia.   Only 10 250 electric and plug-in hybrid vans were sold in 2015, representing 0.7 % of the total EU van sales. This is lower than the 184 000 electric and plug-in hybrid passenger cars sold the same year, a share of 1.3% of  total car sales .   Diesel vehicles continue to make up the vast majority of the new van fleet, constituting 97 % of sales.          Background   The EEA collects and regularly  publish data on new light commercial vehicles registered in Europe , in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 510/2011. The data reported by all Member States in order to evaluate the efficiency of the new vehicle fleet includes information on CO2 emissions and vehicle weight.   It has not yet been confirmed whether different manufacturers have met their own specific annual targets, based on the average weight of the light commercial vehicles they sell. Part of the reason for the small annual reduction observed in 2015 was due to regulatory changes in France. Companies can no longer register company cars as light commercial vehicles as a result of which the share of lower emitting vehicles in the total number of newly registered vans in France has decreased. The EEA will publish the final data on manufacturers’ individual performances as well as additional assessment of the data in the autumn. Manufacturers now have three months to verify the preliminary data and notify errors to the European Commission.   Member States report new vehicles’ CO 2  emission levels, measured under  standardised laboratory conditions, following the requirements of the  New European Driving Cycle  (NEDC) test procedure . This procedure is designed to allow a comparison of emissions for different manufacturers. However, there is now wide recognition that the NEDC test procedure, dating from the 1970s, is out-dated and does not necessarily represent real-world driving conditions and emissions due inter alia to a number of flexibilities that allow vehicle manufacturers to optimise the conditions under which their vehicles are tested.    Recognising these shortcomings, in January 2016 the European Commission   proposed a number of changes   to the current vehicle type-approval framework. A new procedure known as the ‘Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure’ (WLTP) will be introduced in the future so that laboratory results better represent actual vehicle performance on the road. However, the date of its introduction remains to be decided.    vans climate change mitigation carbon dioxide co2 emissions light commercial vehicles fuel efficiency,The average van registered in 2015 emitted 168.2 g CO2/km which is 0.9 g less than in 2014.

"better-integration-of-land-use  Better integration of land use impacts needed across EU policies  Land is a valuable and limited resource. The environmental impact of land used for building new roads, houses or energy grids should be better integrated into European Union policies, according to a report released today by the European Environment Agency. A preliminary review on how land is used in the EU found that more attention should be paid to environmental concerns.     The report  ‘The direct and indirect impacts of EU policies on land,’  looks at key aspects of land use, including land take, which is when land is ‘taken’ or developed for infrastructure such as roads, or rail networks. Land take can lead to land degradation and have a negative impact on the natural functioning of soils. Land take involves soil sealing, which can lead to soil biodiversity loss. Land degradation includes erosion and the loss of organic matter in the soils. These have a knock-on effect on ecosystems, food production and the regulation of water.   The EEA report checks the EU’s four biggest policies — the Cohesion Policy, Transport Policy, Energy Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy — to see how they affect land use across Europe.  The analysis was carried out based on an approach or methodology that looked at a set of evaluation criteria, including evidence of impacts, relevance, coherence, effectiveness, and EU added value.   The initial evaluation found that the policies would be more effective if they better balance environmental concerns with other priorities. This can be done with the use of targets to improve the balance between demand and supply of available land. This would also help EU-wide efforts to protect land and the environment.   The report also considers EU objectives related to land take and land degradation under the  EU’s 7 th  Environment Action Programme , which aims to protect land and soil for future generations. EU objectives include setting a target of ‘no net land take’ by 2050; reducing soil erosion; increasing soil organic matter; remediating contaminated sites; and integrating land use concerns into all levels of government, including via the adoption of targets on soil and land as a resource.   The analysis also draws on  two in-depth case studies, assessing the impacts of EU Cohesion Policy, and specifically spending for transport on land in Poland, and the role of EU policies in land take and land degradation impacts in the region of Andalusia, Spain.    Key Findings     The evaluation highlights the need to further integrate EU land objectives in the four policy areas. The report identified the increased covering up of soil by concrete or pavement (soil sealing), the fragmentation of the landscape due to transport networks, and land degradation due to intensive agriculture and biofuel production, as key challenges.       The four EU policies have major impacts on land use. And all four provide an opportunity to integrate better land use practices across the entire EU, and across borders. Without these EU policies, coherent and effective integration of land use practices cannot be possible.       Future policy making on land should consider setting targets on better land use as part of new EU policy on land as a resource. These can help prevent degradation and other negative impacts. The use of environmental impact assessments should be reinforced.

"more-action-required-to-protect-1  More action required to protect soil in the city   Industrial activity, pollution and exploitation are degrading the quality of soils located in and around our cities, according to a report released today by the European Environment Agency (EEA). Efficient use of soils supported by better planning and policy making in urban areas is needed to make sure that this valuable natural resource helps our cities remain liveable and able to deal with challenges like climate change.   The EEA report, ‘ Soil resource efficiency in urbanised areas: Analytical framework and implications for governance ,’ stresses the need for more research and mapping of the soils and their functions.   Soil is a core component of the land system and plays a central role in the functioning of our ecosystems. Humans derive a range of valuable services from soil, although the contribution of the soil resource is often indirect and somewhat hidden.   Especially in urban areas, the essential role that soil plays to our everyday lives and to other living things on our planet is often underestimated. City landscapes often entail that soil is covered up by cement, asphalt, buildings and other man-made structures, or used as dumping grounds for pollutants. The covering up of soil (soil sealing) and local soil contamination are the two top threats to the quality of soils in urban areas. The report highlights that the compaction of soil, or the increased densification of soil grains also present problems, especially in preventing the proper absorption of water.   Soil underpins 90% of all human food and is essential for water and ecosystem health. But it is also a key resource to the viability of cities. The report highlights that the services provided by soil in cities go far beyond the basic ingredients in the creation of green infrastructure like parks, or playgrounds. Soil helps maintain biodiversity and serves important cultural functions such as hosting cemeteries or being an archive of human activity.   Urban soils hold other man-made infrastructure like sewage systems or underground transport systems. Unsealed land in cities also plays a key function in helping to mitigate the effects of climate change. Uncovered soil acts as a regulator of water runoff and can help to prevent flooding. It also helps to regulate often hotter temperatures in city cores and can store carbon.   Some European Member States already have policy targets for monitoring and reversing the covering up of soil in urban areas as well as for dealing with soil contamination.   Key findings     Policies and regulations for urban areas, including those that apply to spatial planning, should ensure that soils are protected in the interest of the public, based on “a sound understanding of the functions and values of soils.” In addition to its ecological and economic benefits, the soil’s value to fulfil human needs should also be considered.       Soil should be seen as a limited resource and not as waste. Soil management, including its reuse and recycling, should be an integral part of city planning and construction projects.

"take-part-in-our-photography  Take part in our photography competition ‘My City’   Cities play an increasingly important part in our lives. Urban areas are where we live, work, rest and play. The European Environment Agency (EEA) invites you to participate in the ‘My City’ photography competition and share the moments you captured in European cities.   Every year, the EEA organises a competition to engage with European citizens around different environmental issues. This year’s competition focuses on cities. About 75% of Europeans live in cities, making it no surprise that they have become key hubs for culture, education and health services as well as engines of Europe’s economy. However, cities depend heavily on the resources of other regions to meet their demand for energy, water, food as well as the disposal of waste.   Many cities are facing increasing challenges as they struggle to cope with social, economic and environmental problems. Pressures such as overcrowding or decline, social inequality, pollution and traffic are just some of the issues. On the other hand, the proximity of people, businesses, and services provides opportunities to build a more resource-efficient Europe. How can cities ensure a high quality of life in a healthy urban environment?   The ‘My City’ photo competition invites people from across Europe to share what their urban environment means for them. Participants can choose to depict a European city of their choice to tell a positive or negative story through their photos.

"reported-co2-emissions-from-new  Reported CO2 emissions from new cars continue to fall  Emissions from official testing reported by national authorities show that new cars sold in the European Union (EU) are increasingly more fuel-efficient. Last year, new passenger cars emitted on average 119.6 grammes (g) of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilometre, 8% below the official EU target set for 2015, according to provisional data published today by the European Environment Agency (EEA).   In 2015, the average CO 2  emissions of a new car sold was 3% lower than in the previous year, according to  provisional data  . Since 2010, when monitoring started under current legislation, official emissions have decreased by more than 20 g CO 2 /km. The EU already met its 2015 target of 130 g CO 2 /km in 2013, two years ahead of schedule. A second official target of 95 g CO 2 /km has to be met by 2021.   Key findings       New cars sold in 2015 emitted on average 119.6 g CO 2 /km, more than 10 g CO 2 /km below the 2015 target, according to reported emissions.   Sales of new passenger cars in the EU increased in 2015 compared to the previous year. A total of 13.7 million new cars were registered, representing an increase of 9% compared to 2014. Registrations increased in all EU Member States except Luxembourg and Slovenia.   The average mass of new cars sold in the EU (1 381 kg) remained broadly the same as in 2014. The mass of a vehicle is a key factor affecting emissions. On average, the heaviest cars were sold in Sweden and Luxembourg (1 530 kg and 1 496 kg respectively) whereas Maltese, Danish and Greek buyers preferred lighter cars (1 199, 1 233 and 1 260 kg respectively). The average diesel vehicle sold was 311 kg heavier than the average petrol vehicle.   The least fuel-efficient cars were bought in Estonia and Latvia (137 g CO 2 /km) followed by Bulgaria (130 g CO 2 /km). For all remaining Member States, the average emission levels were below 130 g CO 2 /km. As seen in 2014, the Netherlands (101.2 g CO 2 /km) was the country that registered the most efficient new cars. Portugal and Denmark followed with new cars emitting on average 106 g CO 2 /km.   Diesel cars remain the most sold vehicles in the EU, constituting 52% of sales. As in past years, the countries with the highest proportions of diesel sales include Ireland and Luxembourg (71%), Portugal (69%), and Croatia, Greece and Spain (63%).    The average fuel efficiency of petrol cars (122.6 g CO  2  /km) has been catching up with the fuel-efficiency of diesel cars (119.2 g CO  2  /km) in recent years.     Sales of plug-in hybrids and battery-electric vehicles continued to increase. The relative share of plug-in hybrids and battery-electric vehicle sales was highest in the Netherlands and Denmark, reaching 12% and 8 % respectively of national car sales in 2015. However, sales of such vehicles still remain a small fraction of total sales, accounting for just 1.3 % of all new EU cars sold.     Around 57 000 pure battery-electric vehicles were registered in 2015, a 50% increase compared to 2014. The largest number of registrations were recorded in France (more than 17 650 vehicles), Germany (more than 12 350 vehicles) and the UK (more than 9 900 vehicles).                 EEA activities   The EEA collects and regularly makes available  data on new passenger vehicles registered in Europe , in accordance with EU Regulation (EC) No 443/2009. The data reported by all Member States in order to evaluate the efficiency of the new vehicle fleet includes information on CO 2  emissions and vehicle weight.   It has not yet been confirmed whether different manufacturers have met their own specific annual targets, based on the average weight of the cars they sell. The EEA will publish the final data on manufacturers’ individual performances in the autumn.   Testing vehicle emissions   Member States report new vehicles’ CO 2  emission levels, measured under  standardised laboratory conditions, following the requirements of the  New European Driving Cycle  (NEDC) test procedure . This procedure is designed to allow a comparison of emissions for different manufacturers. However, there is now wide recognition that the NEDC test procedure, dating from the 1970s, is out-dated and does not necessarily represent real-world driving conditions and emissions due inter alia to a number of flexibilities that allow vehicle manufacturers to optimise the conditions under which their vehicles are tested. The EEA has recently published  a non-technical guide  explaining the key reasons for the differences observed between official and real world driving emissions.   Recognising these shortcomings, in January 2016 the European Commission  proposed a number of changes  to the current vehicle type-approval framework. A new procedure known as the ‘Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure’ (WLTP) will also be introduced in the future so that laboratory results better represent actual vehicle performance on the road. However, the date of its introduction remains to be decided.       co2 emissions petrol passenger cars diesel electric cars climate change mitigation fuel efficiency,In 2015, the average CO2 emissions of a new car sold was 3% lower than in the previous year, according to provisional data .

"assessment  Imperviousness and imperviousness change   Between 2006 and 2009, soil sealing, or imperviousness, increased in all EEA-39 countries by a total of 4 364 k m  2  . This corresponds to an annual average increase of 1 454 k  m  2  , or 0.027 % of the total EEA-39 area.During this period, the rate of increase in soil sealing relative to country area varied from 0.001 % to 0.48 %. In 2009, the percentage of a countries' total area that was sealed also varied greatly, with values ranging from 0.15 % to 15.23 %. The highest sealing values, as a percentage of country area, occurred in small countries with high population densities, while the lowest sealing values could be found in large countries with low population densities.    The most problematic situation occurs in countries where there is already a high percentage of sealing and where the annual rate of increase relative to country area is high.   imperviousness imperviousness indicator soil sealing imd change    LSI LSI002 002,Between 2006 and 2009, the extent of soil sealing in the EEA-39 countries increased by 4 364 km2 to a total area of 112 614 km2 (or 1.9 % of the EEA-39 area), according to imperviousness data. This corresponds to an annual average increase of 1 454km2, or0.027 % of the total EEA-39 area. Percentage of country area sealed: While on average, 1.85 % of the total area covered by the countries was sealed in 2006, this increased to 1.93 % in 2009.See Figure 1 for a comparison of country averages between 2006 and 2009 and Figure 2 for a map of sealing density in 2009, based on a 10 km grid. In 2009, three groups of countries could be identified:a) Countries with avery low sealed area as a percentage of total area (i.e. <1.0 %), e.g. Iceland (0.15 %), Norway (0.3 %), Sweden (0.5 %) and six other countries.b) Countries with medium high sealing values between 1.0 % and 3.0 %. There are 18 such countries.c) A considerable number of countries with high sealing values between 3.0 % and 15.2 %. There are 12 such countries, including Germany (5.1 %), Liechtenstein (6.2 %), Belgium (7.4 %), theNetherlands (8.2 %)and Malta (15.2 %). See figure 1. A more detailed spatial pattern of existing sealing in 2009, based on 10 kmgrid cells, can be seen in Figure 2. The main urban areas that have grid cells with high sealing levels are shown in dark red, while green areas represent grid cells without any sealing detected in the 2009 imperviousness product. Percentage increase in sealing: Sealing increased in all countries between 2006 and 2009. The average percentage annual increase for the period was 1.35 % across the EEA-39, with annual values ranging from 0.53 % for the United Kingdom to 4.84 % for Norway. See Figure 3 for yearly increases by country.However, it should be noted that in countries with little relative and absolute sealing (e.g. Norway), even relatively modest (absolute) increases create high change rates. Given that the imperviousness indicator does not capture land cover flows, it is not possible to monitor directly which land cover is mainly affected by an increase in sealing. The indicator can, however, be used together with Corine Land Cover (CLC) to establish in more detail which land cover strata are mainly affected by sealing increases. On average, most of the sealing increases between 2006 and 2009 occurred in the CLC classes listed below. Most of the changes occurred in just a few of the CLC classes (the first four CLC classes listed below cover some 67 % of the total increase). Percentage annual increase in sealing area (2006-2009) relative to country area (imperviousness indicator): The imperviousness indicator shows that, on average, the annual rate of increase amounted to 0.027 % of the total EEA-39 area for the 2006-2009 period. The annual percentage increase in sealing relative to country area ranges from 0.001 % in Iceland to values above 0.1 % for Cyprus, Lithuania and Malta. See Figure 4 for a graph with results by country, and Figure 5 for a map with indicator results based on a 10 km grid. CLC classes with the highest increase of imperviousness total area: 112 Discontinuous urban fabric(120 042 ha) 211 Non-irrigated arable land(85 829 ha) 242 Complex cultivation patterns(50 769 ha) 121 Industrial or commercial units(38 141 ha) 231 Pastures(19 653 ha) 243 Land principally occupied by agriculture, with significant areas of natural vegetation(16 439 ha)  CLC classes where highest share (percentage of area) is lost to imperviousness: 133 Construction sites (5.13%) 121 Industrial or commercial units(1.61%) 111 Continuous urban fabric(1.13%) 123 Port areas(1.01%) 122 Road and rail network and associated land(1.00%) 112 Discontinuous urban fabric(0.79%) "
"world-water-day-is-europe  Is Europe's freshwater use sustainable?  We need freshwater for human consumption and economic activities such as food production and industry, but does Europe manage this valuable resource in a sustainable way? An indicator assessment published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) on World Water Day takes a look at the use of freshwater resources across Europe.   The EEA indicator assessment ' Use of freshwater resources ' shows that while water is generally abundant in Europe, water scarcity and droughts continue to affect some regions, especially those that are densely populated and have high demands for water from agriculture and tourism during the summer.   The  water exploitation index plus (WEI+) of European River Basin Districtsis the percentage of total freshwater used compared to the renewable freshwater resources available. The EEA indicator shows that around 20 river basin districts, mainly in the Mediterranean, face structural water stress issues (WEI > 20 %). These include Cyprus, Malta, Crete, the Balearic Islands and Sicily. The situation is even worse in summer. The average WEI for the summers 2002-2012 were 81 % and 55 % for Cyprus and Segura, Spain respectively which suggests severe water stress and clearly unsustainable resource use.    Water stress, increasingly, occurs in other parts of Europe . The main drivers are growing urban populations and higher living standards coupled with reduced water availability due to pollution and drought. Many large cities have developed wide networks for transporting water, often over distances of more than 100-200 km to be able to respond to the demand for water.         Other key findings      During winter, approximately 30 million inhabitantslive under water stress conditions, while the figure for summer is around 70 million. This corresponds to 6 % and 14 % of the total population of Europe respectively.    Agriculture accounts for36 % of total water use on an annual scale. In summer, this increases to about 60 %. Agriculture in the Mediterranean region alone accounts for almost 75 % of total water used for agriculture in Europe.    Around 20 % of the total population of the Mediterranean regionlive under permanent water stress conditions.More than half (53 %) of the Mediterranean population is effected by water stressduring the summer.    Public water supply is second to agriculture, accounting for 32 % of total water use.   The service sector, including businesses dealing with tourism, has become one of the main pressures on renewable water resources, accounting for 11 % of total annual water use. Small Mediterranean islands in particular are under severe water stress conditions due toreceiving 10-15 times more tourists than they have local inhabitants.     About World Water Day   World Water Day focuses on the importance of freshwater and calls for its sustainable use. This day was first formally proposed during the Rio Summit in 1992. The United Nations (UN) General Assembly responded by designating 22 March 1993 as the first World Water Day.

"is-europe-doing-enough-to  Is Europe doing enough to ensure long-term health of forests?  Climate change, pollution and encroaching human development are posing an increased threat to the long-term stability and health of European forests, according to a new European Environment Agency (EEA) report released today. Forest ecosystems play a vital role for the environment and in combatting climate change. The report recommends that better sustainable management is needed to ensure this precious green resource is there for future generations.   The EEA report   European forest ecosystems - state and trends  , gives an updated health check on how our forests are coping with the many challenges they face. It assesses whether forest ecosystems can still manage to play their part providing key ‘services’ for the environment. Forests help regulate our climate and sustain watersheds, providing clean water. They also act as ‘carbon sinks’, clean the air we breathe and help preserve and protect biodiversity as many species depend on forests for their home. There is a growing awareness of the important role forests play in mitigating climate change, in particular after the  climate talks in Paris (COP21) .   The report identifies habitat loss and degradation, the risk posed by invasive alien species, pollution and climate change as the top four challenges European forests face today. These threats, combined with economic activities such as logging, urban sprawl, or the increasing use of forests by humans for leisure, make forests more vulnerable to degradation.   To tackle these problems and to improve the protection of forests, the report calls for enhanced research and data collection on a European level, tapping into national forest inventories and monitoring to better track changes in forest cover and conditions. It also calls for EU policies to take forest activities more into account.   Enhanced coordination among stakeholders, forest owners, timber industry, policy makers, and the general public is needed to improve the sustainable management of forests, not only when it comes to timber production but also on the use of forests for other ecosystem services.   Other findings     Forests remain the dominant natural habitat across most of Europe. In 2015, forests and other wooded land covered more than 40% of the total land surface in the 33 member countries and six cooperating countries of the EEA. This is equal to 186 million hectares (ha).   Almost 70% of forested areas in Europe is within six countries: Sweden (28 million ha), Finland (22 million ha), Spain (18 million ha), France (17 million ha), Norway and Turkey (both 12 million ha).   Climate change is likely to have a significant impact both on the zones where tree species can live and the range of tree species that can thrive in Europe. Increased periods of droughts and warmer winters are expected to further weaken forests against invasive species and make trees more susceptible to disease, pests and pathogens.    European forests have increased in area since 1990. The increase in forest cover is likely due to the natural expansion of forests and afforestation on farmland in rural and remote areas.     For the 2007-2012 period, the 27 EU Member States reported that only 26% of forest species and 15% of forest habitats of European interest, as listed in the EU’s Habitats Directive, were in ‘favorable conservation status.’ Recent reports by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) indicate that 27% of mammals, 10% of reptiles and 8% of amphibians linked to forests are threatened with extinction within the EU.      climate change consequences forest day forest industry forests sustainable forest management urban sprawl forest ecosystems forest biodiversity habitat fragmentation forest degradation,The EEA report European forest ecosystems - state and trends, gives an updated health check on how our forests are coping with the many challenges they face.

To tackle these problems and to improve the protection of forests, the report calls for enhanced research and data collection on a European level, tapping into national forest inventories and monitoring to better track changes in forest cover and conditions. It also calls for EU policies to take forest activities more into account. Enhanced coordination among stakeholders, forest owners, timber industry, policy makers, and the general public is needed to improve the sustainable management of forests, not only when it comes to timber production but also on the use of forests for other ecosystem services. Other findings  Forests remain the dominant natural habitat across most of Europe. In 2015, forests and other wooded land covered more than 40% of the total land surface in the 33 member countries and six cooperating countries of the EEA. This is equal to 186 million hectares (ha). Almost 70% of forested areas in Europe is within six countries: Sweden (28 million ha), Finland (22 million ha), Spain (18 million ha), France (17 million ha), Norway and Turkey (both 12 million ha). Climate change is likely to have a significant impact both on the zones where tree species can live and the range of tree species that can thrive in Europe. Increased periods of droughts and warmer winters are expected to further weaken forests against invasive species and make trees more susceptible to disease, pests and pathogens. European forests have increased in area since 1990. The increase in forest cover is likely due to the natural expansion of forests and afforestation on farmland in rural and remote areas. For the 2007-2012 period, the 27 EU Member States reported that only 26% of forest species and 15% of forest habitats of European interest, as listed in the EU’s Habitats Directive, were in ‘favorable conservation status.’ Recent reports by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) indicate that 27% of mammals, 10% of reptiles and 8% of amphibians linked to forests are threatened with extinction within the EU.

"renewables-increasingly-curbing-reliance-on  Renewables increasingly curbing reliance on fossil fuels  The use of fossil fuels across the European Union continues to decline due in part to increased consumption of renewable energy sources like wind, solar and biomass, according to a report published today by the European Environment Agency (EEA). The report, which assesses progress on the use of renewable energy, found that clean energy technologies are an important driving force in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and in creating employment in Europe.   The EEA report ‘ Renewable energy in Europe 2016: recent growth and knock-on effects ,’ shows that clean and renewable energy sources are being widely embraced.   The EU-wide share of renewable energy has increased from 14.3% in 2012 to 15% in 2013. Based on preliminary data for 2014, the EEA had estimated further growth in the share of renewable energy at 15.2%. This upward trend was recently confirmed by  Eurostat  (16%) showing growth which was even stronger than anticipated.   The additional consumption of renewable energy, compared to the level of consumption in 2005, has allowed the EU to cut its demand for fossil fuels by 110 Million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2013. This is equivalent to a gross reduction of carbon dioxide emissions of 362 Million tonnes (Mt) in 2013.   The data shows that renewable energy sources are playing a key part in Europe’s energy transition and are complementing climate change mitigation policies while improving Europe’s overall energy security.   Europe is playing a leading role in developing clean energy sources. Throughout 2005-2014, Europe had the highest shares of global new investments in renewable energy technologies, being surpassed by China only in 2013. The EU is also one of the key players with regard to employment in the renewable energy sector.   As renewables growth is picking up also in other parts of the world, the EU needs to sustain and increase its efforts to support and develop renewable energy sources in order to maintain its competitive advantage. However, certain forms of renewable energy can impact health and the environment such as traditional use of biomass or large infrastructure projects such as hydroelectricity.   Other findings     Coal was the fuel most substituted by renewables across Europe in 2013 and in 2014, (roughly 45% of all avoided fossil fuels) followed by natural gas (roughly 29% of all avoided fossil fuels).       The uptake of renewable energy sources vary widely among EU Member States, ranging from more than 30% of gross final energy consumption in Sweden (52.1%), Latvia (37.1%) and Finland (36.8%) in 2013, to less than 5% in Luxembourg (3.6%), Malta (3.8%) and the Netherlands (4.5%).       As a result of national growth in the consumption of renewable energy since 2005, Germany, Italy and Spain achieved the largest reduction in domestic fossil fuel use and gross avoided greenhouse gas emissions in 2013.       The EU contributes significantly to the global roll-out of modern renewable energy technologies. In 2014, the EU had the largest installed and connected solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power capacities in the world. Since 2005, Europe has led the way in funding the development of renewable energy sources, with its share of investments in renewable energy fluctuating between 40-50% until 2011.       Public funding in research and development of new renewable energy sources has increased between 2005 and 2013 but at a slower pace than before, posing a risk of missing the break-through technologies of tomorrow. The International Energy Agency has recommended the tripling of current public research and development spending on clean-energy innovation.     This report is an update to last year’s Renewable energy in Europe report (LINK) and shows in detail developments in renewable energy uptake since 2005. It also complements last year’s  ‘Trends and Projections in Europe 2015 – Tracking progress towards Europe’s climate and energy targets’  report.   renewable sources renewable energy fossil fuels energy production emissions from energy,The EEA report ‘Renewable energy in Europe 2016: recent growth and knock-on effects,’ shows that clean and renewable energy sources are being widely embraced.

"average-age-of-the-vehicle-8  Average age of the vehicle fleet     The average age of road vehicles in Europe has increased since 2000.   In 2014, the average age of passenger cars was 7.4 years, 8 % older than that of the average fleet in 2000. For other vehicle types, the average age was 8.4 years for vans,8.1 years for heavy duty vehicles,9.1 years for two-wheelers, and 9.4 years for buses.     road vehicles term 033 average age   TERM TERM033 033, The average age of Europe's passenger cars reached a maximum in 2009, although by 2014 ithad decreased slightly to an average age of 7.4 years. This is nevertheless 8 % higher than the figure for 2000, when the average age was 6.8 years.The share of cars aged 10 years or over is generally increasing across Europe's fleet, as consumers are tending tohold on to their vehicles longer than ever before. The average age of passenger cars in the EU-27 (data for Croatia are not available) varies widely among different countries. In 2014, the lowest average age was observed in Luxemburg (5.5 years), and the highest in Slovakia (11.3 years). In general, diesel passenger cars have a lower average age compared to petrol. This is due to the growth of the diesel car market over recent years, i.e. more new diesel vehicles are registered in Europe each year than petrol vehicles (see also TERM 32 indicator on dieselisation). In general, older vehicles are used less compared to new ones i.e. they have a lower annual mileage. Hence, from an environmental perspective, the performance of the vehicle fleet can be considered somewhat better than the average age suggests. The average age of light commercial and heavy-duty vehiclesincreased between2000 and 2014, goingfrom 6.6 and 7.5 years respectively to 8.4 and 8.1 years.The age of two-wheel vehicles increased from 8.9 to 9 years over the same period, reaching its peak in 2004, with an average age of 9.5 years. The average age of buses has also increased, from an average of 8.7 years in 2000 to 9.4 years in 2014. "
"moving-beyond-waste-management-towards  Moving beyond waste management towards a green economy  Our current resource use is not sustainable and is putting pressure on our planet. We need to facilitate a transition towards a circular, green economy by moving beyond waste policies and focusing on eco-design, innovation and investments. Research can foster not only innovation in production, but also in business models and financing mechanisms.     The European Commission proposed on 2 December 2015 a new legislative package on  circular economy . The package covers different stages of a product’s extended lifecycle from production and consumption to waste management and the market for secondary raw materials. The proposed actions are designed to benefit both the environment and the economy, and extract the maximum value and use from all raw materials, products and waste, fostering energy savings and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.   Over the last decades, legislation to protect the environment has evolved from issue-specific responses to more integrated and systemic responses. The circular economy package is one of the latest examples of such integrated policy responses and is certainly a significant step towards the European Union’s objective of ‘living well within the planet’s ecological limits’.   Our  European environment: State and Outlook 2015 report  (SOER2015) underlines the sustainability challenge we are facing today. We are consuming and extracting more resources, both in Europe and in the world, than our planet can replace at a given time. On the one hand, economic activities contribute to human well-being and poverty reduction. On the other, they pollute the environment, warm the planet, damage human health while weakening the planet’s capacity to provide for us. Climate change and population growth projection add to the urgency for comprehensive and immediate action.   Although no country has achieved so far both ‘living well’ and within its natural means, there are some encouraging signs. The European Union has started to break the link between economic growth and consumption of energy and materials. Europeans are recycling a larger share of their municipal waste and sending less to landfills. Eco-industries (e.g. working on renewable energy, waste water treatment, air pollution control, etc.) have grown considerably over the last decade and created jobs despite the recent recession.   Reducing dependence on raw materials   A circular economy strives to reduce the ‘inflow’ of new resources, especially non-renewable resources, to use, re-use and valorise the resources in the economy as much as possible, and to minimise the ‘outflow’ of emissions and waste.   The message is clear: potential reductions in waste could generate substantial gains for the economy and human health. Keeping already extracted resources in use would not only reduce dependence on raw materials (domestically extracted or imported), but also boost competitiveness while reducing environmental pressures. A preliminary analysis by the EEA shows that European countries are already taking action to improve their resource efficiency, mainly due to economic concerns linked to resource dependency.   Waste prevention, recycling and better waste management in general are all certainly crucial to minimise the flows into and out of the economy. However, closing the material loop is not sufficient to prevent further impacts on the environment and human health and well-being. Circular economy approaches need to go beyond waste management, and facilitate a transition to green economy. We need to re-think the way we produce, consume and dispose of products.   Unlocking the eco-design potential   To start with, eco-design is essential for increasing recycling potential and extending the lifetime of products. We can design products in a way that they can be easily repaired, have only their broken pieces replaced and have their components easily sorted for optimal recycling.   We also need to consider health and environmental aspects of the materials we use in our products. Eco-design could equally help replace materials with high environmental impacts with better alternatives. For example, it is clear that exposure to hazardous chemicals is a serious health concern. We can adopt clean materials cycles to prevent human exposure to hazardous substances and to protect ecosystems from chemical pollution.   Similarly, bio-based materials, such as wood, crops or fibres, can be used for a wide range of products and energy needs. However, a potential shift to bio-based materials should be analysed in view of associated ecosystem and health impacts. There are for example limits to forest exploitation and burning wood for energy could worsen air quality.   Investments to foster innovation   Eco-innovation and research promoting innovative solutions are essential for a shift to a circular economy. Innovation is not only limited to production processes. New business models could be encouraged and supported. There are already many examples of innovative solutions providing services rather than selling products: you don’t for example need to own a car to meet your transport needs. Such collaborative business models focusing on service provision could benefit from new financing mechanisms, since investment and profit follow a different pattern in time.   Public funds across Europe are already supporting eco-innovation but they can play an even stronger role than they do today. Investments in infrastructure, research and cities could all be geared towards facilitating the transition to a green economy. A strong commitment to sustainability backed by a clear financial and regulatory framework sends the right signal to all stakeholders.   It is clear that moving towards a green, circular economy will benefit some groups and sectors, while putting pressure on others. Policy makers will need to take into account equity considerations, both within Europe and globally, and offer support measures to facilitate and steer the socio-economic transition needed.        Hans Bruyninckx   EEA Executive Director   Editorial published in the  issue no. 2016/1 of the EEA newsletter , March 2016   green economy circular economy,The European Commission proposed on 2 December 2015 a new legislative package on circular economy.

"sustainable-management-is-the-key  Sustainable management is the key to healthy forests in Europe  Forests in Europe provide us essential services: clean air, clean water, natural carbon storage, timber, food and other products. They are home to many species and habitats. We talked about the challenges Europe’s forests face with Annemarie Bastrup-Birk, forest and environment expert at the European Environment Agency.    Why are forests so important for the health of our environment?    Forests provide many vital ecosystem services for the environment and climate. For example, they help regulate our climate and sustain watersheds, providing us clean water. They help clean the air we breathe. Growth in forest stock often helps capture large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They also help preserve and protect biodiversity as many species live and depend on forests. They are an important economic resource as well, not only for the timber production but also other resources used for medicines and other products. Forests also play other important roles for human wellbeing and recreation.   In Europe, the total area covered by forests is actually increasing, mainly due to afforestation policies and conversion of abandoned farm land into forests. Forests cover more than 40% of the total land surface in the 33 member countries and six cooperating countries of the European Environment Agency.   Nevertheless, the health of forests is a global issue and the total forest area is decreasing in the world. And Europeans do have an impact on global deforestation. We import agricultural products as well as wood products which are the main causes of global deforestation affecting mainly in the tropical or boreal forests.   The total area covered by forests is not the only indicator that should be taken into account.   What key challenges do forests in Europe face?   Forests in Europe face many challenges, including the loss of habitats and higher risks linked to invasive species, pollution and climate change. Increasing use by humans for various activities, construction of transport networks and urban sprawl are also exerting pressure on forests. Fragmentation, when large forests end up divided into many smaller patches situated in between farm land or urban development, clearly affects forests and forest-dependent species.   These issues are analysed in our upcoming report on the state and trends of Europe’s forest ecosystems, which will be published later this month. The report confirms that we need to protect our forests and ensure sustainable management of forest ecosystems, not only when it comes to timber production, but also when using our forests for other vital ecosystem services essential for our well-being.   Why are sustaining and protecting our forests so important?   Historically, forests are the natural habitat for large parts of Europe and they have been providing essential services for our environment and wellbeing. They are very rich in terms of biodiversity and are essential for our efforts in sustaining natural habitats in Europe.   In recent years, there has been growing awareness of their importance in various policy discussions, especially now with the Paris COP 21 agreement where forests were an integral part of climate talks. When it comes to carbon sequestration and mitigating climate change, forests are perhaps the only natural instrument we can manage. We can grow them and cut them down. We don’t have such control with oceans, for example.   To what extent does climate change threaten our forests?   We know that they will be impacted, but we do not know how and to what extent exactly. Climate change can have both positive and negative effects. If you have a warmer climate, tree growth is likely to increase and might be a positive outcome in terms of timber production. It can also affect the tree line, which can move more with altitude and to the north. At the same time, forests can face an increased number of threats, in terms of pathogens, diseases, pests and more invasive species.   For example, in response to warmer and drier spring and summer periods, the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) has a shorter development period and is able to reproduce multiple times during the season, increasing their numbers.   Changes in climate conditions can make forests more vulnerable amid more extreme weather. Changes to rain patterns (wetter or drier) could result in existing tree species being replaced by other species that are better able to survive and thrive in the new climate conditions.   Although most forest fires in Europe are caused by people, extreme droughts and dry conditions can increase the risk of forest fire, especially in southern Europe. And such fires can be devastating for forest ecosystems.   What are the EU and the EEA doing to address these challenges?   Management of forests remains a national responsibility. But a European process is underway to set certain criteria and guidelines on how best to take care of forests in Europe. Although there is no EU forest policy, the European Union (EU) wants to support and implement a sustainable management of forests in Europe and to protect and preserve the multiple functions of forests. To this end, the EU adopted a new  Forest Strategy  which came out in September 2013. The strategy tries to promote better coordination between all the stakeholders involved.   The Agency produces assessments to contribute to the knowledge base on Europe’s forests and to raise awareness about the challenges forests face, while identifying future prospects. To this end, we collaborate closely with the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre and Eurostat. We also work with Copernicus the European Earth Observation Programme, which maps forests and forest types as part of its land monitoring service. In addition, we coordinate with UN agencies and other international organisations to share data. Through our extensive environmental expertise and partners, we are able to link forests to other environmental issues, such as climate, agriculture, transport and biodiversity, and therefore formulate a better and comprehensive understanding of the pressures on forest ecosystems.

"The EEA report ‘Mapping and assessing the condition of Europe’s ecosystems: progress and challenges’ gives a snapshot of current ecosystem health in Europe. It identifies key gaps in data which are essential to properly assess the health of Europe’s many ecosystems. The report concludes improved mapping and assessments are needed in order to understand the problems faced by Europe’s ecosystems and to restore these key life-sustaining systems to better health. This understanding is vital for policymakers to come up with suitable responses. The well-being of our societies is heavily dependent on our thriving ecosystems, which provide the basic building blocks of our day-to-day survival, including fertile soil, fresh water, pollination, natural flood protection and climate regulation. This ‘natural capital’ is being degraded or lost as a result of human activity. The report looks at eight broad ecosystem types in Europe: urban, cropland, grassland, heathland and shrub, woodland and forest, wetlands, freshwater, and marine. It assesses the pressures and challenges each of the different types face as well as the impacts on habitats and species. Key Findings   An analysis of the data shows that some of the most sensitive ecosystems like heathlands, wetlands and freshwater bodies in Europe are highly concentrated in a small number of countries, which could increase their vulnerability to environmental change.  A substantial proportion of these very vulnerable ecosystems are not protected within Natura 2000 EU protected sites, Marine Protected Areas or similar zones that aim to preserve habitats and biodiversity. Well over half of all the habitats and species covered by the EU’s Habitats Directive are assessed as being in ‘unfavourable’ condition, and their conservation status is generally declining or stable, with only a small proportion ‘improving.’ An initial assessment found that habitat change (including pollution, habitat loss and fragmentation) has had the greatest overall impact across ecosystems to date. Pressures like nutrient and pollution loads are still increasing and all ecosystem types are facing increased pressure due to climate change and invasive alien species, leading to further negative effects.  Key gaps in knowledge and data will need to be resolved to improve future assessments of Europe’s ecosystems. Specifically, there is a lack of data on urban and marine ecosystems, a lack of understanding of the combined impacts of multiple pressures faced, a lack of detailed spatial data for mapping impacts on biodiversity, and a lack of understanding of the links between ecosystem condition, biodiversity and ecosystem service delivery.

These are the findings of a European Environment Agency (EEA) report published today which takes stock of the condition of Europe’s ecosystems.   The EEA report ‘ Mapping and assessing the condition of Europe’s ecosystems: progress and challenges ’ gives a snapshot of current ecosystem health in Europe. It identifies key gaps in data which are essential to properly assess the health of Europe’s many ecosystems. The report concludes improved mapping and assessments are needed in order to understand the problems faced by Europe’s ecosystems and to restore these key life-sustaining systems to better health. This understanding is vital for policymakers to come up with suitable responses.   The well-being of our societies is heavily dependent on our thriving ecosystems, which provide the basic building blocks of our day-to-day survival, including fertile soil, fresh water, pollination, natural flood protection and climate regulation. This ‘natural capital’ is being degraded or lost as a result of human activity.   The report looks at eight broad ecosystem types in Europe: urban, cropland, grassland, heathland and shrub, woodland and forest, wetlands, freshwater, and marine. It assesses the pressures and challenges each of the different types face as well as the impacts on habitats and species.   Key Findings       An analysis of the data shows that some of the most sensitive ecosystems like heathlands, wetlands and freshwater bodies in Europe are highly concentrated in a small number of countries, which could increase their vulnerability to environmental change.        A substantial proportion of these very vulnerable ecosystems are not protected within Natura 2000 EU protected sites, Marine Protected Areas or similar zones that aim to preserve habitats and biodiversity.     Well over half of all the habitats and species covered by the EU’s Habitats Directive are assessed as being in ‘unfavourable’ condition, and their conservation status is generally declining or stable, with only a small proportion ‘improving.’     An initial assessment found that habitat change (including pollution, habitat loss and fragmentation) has had the greatest overall impact across ecosystems to date. Pressures like nutrient and pollution loads are still increasing and all ecosystem types are facing increased pressure due to climate change and invasive alien species, leading to further negative effects.       Key gaps in knowledge and data will need to be resolved to improve future assessments of Europe’s ecosystems. Specifically, there is a lack of data on urban and marine ecosystems, a lack of understanding of the combined impacts of multiple pressures faced, a lack of detailed spatial data for mapping impacts on biodiversity, and a lack of understanding of the links between ecosystem condition, biodiversity and ecosystem service delivery.

"explaining-vehicle-emissions  Explaining vehicle emissions – why do laboratory and road measurements differ?  The road transport sector is a major contributor to Europe’s emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution. For certain pollutants, vehicles can emit substantially higher emissions on the road than official emissions tested in laboratories. A report released today by the European Environment Agency (EEA) provides a non-technical guide that describes the reasons for these often significant discrepancies.    Despite improvements in vehicle efficiencies over past decades, EEA reports show that the road transport sector is responsible for almost one fifth of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions. It also contributes to high concentrations of air pollutants above EU standards in many of Europe’s cities.   ‘Measuring exhaust emissions from vehicles is a complex issue, and it’s a topic that has been extensively discussed in the media over the past months,’ said EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx. ‘This report explains in simple terms how vehicle emissions occur and how they are tested, and the reasons for the gap between tested and real-world driving emissions.’   The new report, ‘ Explaining road transport emissions: a non-technical guide ’, gives a simplified explanation of the often complex information available on road transport emissions as well as the technologies to reduce them.   Standardised measurements are made in laboratories to check that vehicles meet the official requirements for exhaust emissions. However, the official procedures currently used in Europe are not representative of real driving conditions. For certain pollutants, there is a significant difference between official emission measurements and vehicle performance on the road. Nitrogen oxides (NO x ), a major air pollutant which harms health and the environment, can be more than seven times higher under real world driving conditions for new vehicles than in official tests. New vehicles similarly can emit up to 40 % more carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) than official measurements would indicate.   The report outlines three main reasons for these discrepancies:     An outdated test procedure used in Europe that does not reflect real-world driving conditions;   Permitted ‘flexibilities’ in the current testing procedures that allow manufacturers to optimise certain testing conditions, and thereby achieve lower fuel consumption and CO 2  emission values;   Several in-use factors which are driver dependent (e.g. driving style) or independent (e.g. environmental conditions)     The existing emissions test procedure permits a number of flexibilities which can be used to minimise measured emissions .          In the future two important initiatives are planned in the European Union to help ensure an improved consistency between the official vehicle emissions and real-world driving performance. This includes updating the outdated official test procedure to one that is more representative of real-world emissions, as well as the introduction of a procedure for measuring the real driving NO x  emissions of vehicles on the road.   transport emissions road transport air quality air emissions,Despite improvements in vehicle efficiencies over past decades, EEA reports show that the road transport sector is responsible for almost one fifth of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions.

"floodplain-management-reducing-flood-risks  Floodplain management: reducing flood risks and restoring healthy ecosystems  Floodplains once covered wide stretches along European rivers, but today only fractions of them remain. These ecosystems have an important role to play in reducing flood risks and are also the natural habitat of many endangered species. A new report by the European Environment Agency (EEA) provides an overview of significant floods in Europe and looks at the role of floodplains in flood protection, water management and nature conservation.   The floodplain is the area next to a river bed which is more or less frequently covered with water in times of high water discharges from adjacent rivers. Wetland is one type of floodplain. By retaining water, floodplains can buffer the effects of heavy rainfall and in this way protect economic activities and communities further downstream from flood damage. However, many former natural floodplains are under increased pressure from urban sprawl, infrastructure developments and agriculture. In Europe, up to 90% of floodplains have been lost during the past centuries or are no longer able to serve as functioning natural ecosystems providing flood risk reduction and habitats favouring a high biodiversity.   The EEA report  Flood risks and environmental vulnerability  Exploring the synergies between floodplain restoration, water policies and thematic policies  draws upon information published in the  European flood impact database  which covers floods reported between 1980 and 2010. The report highlights the benefits of an integrated approach to flood risk management and argues that a coordinated implementation of EU legislation, such as the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the Birds and Habitats Directives and the Floods Directive through coherent measures and actions, would enhance the effectiveness of the policies.   The restoration of healthy ecosystems, for example through the Natura 2000 networks, is often a very effective way of preventing and mitigating floods. Even when 'hard' flood defences, such as dykes, are necessary to protect communities, those measures should be complemented with long-term nature-based solutions such as floodplain restoration. By 'greening the grey' and making a network of green infrastructures, the necessary protection levels can be combined with a minimum loss of habitats and a good preservation of ecosystem services.   Other key findings     Between 1980 and 2010, 37 European countries registered 3,563  floods  in total. The highest number of floods was reported for 2010 (321 floods), when 27 countries were affected. This number is associated with the 'Central European floods', which occurred across several Central European countries during May and June 2010.       Based on reporting from nine countries, the report  maps  the share of population living in floodplain areas. Among those countries, Italy has the largest population living in flood-prone areas (6.7 million people, 11% of the population) whereas Hungary has the highest relative share of people living in such areas (1.8 million, 18% of the population).        Annual flood losses  can be expected to increase fivefold by 2050 and up to 17fold by 2080. The major share of this increase (7090%) is estimated to be attributable to socioeconomic development as the economic value of the assets in floodplains increases, and the remainder (1030%) to climate change.       Future extreme floods are likely to be the cost drivers for the adaptation of infrastructure. Ecosystem-based adaptation, nature-based solutions and green infrastructure are, in many cases, key in ensuring a cost-effective approach to an uncertain scenario by delaying or avoiding lock-ins to classic infrastructure-building water management. The report also notes that although strategies for flood risk management require measures that are specific to the local circumstances, using a river basin approach avoids passing on negative consequences further downstream.     floodplain ecosystem services flood risk floods natural water retention measures policy integration birds and habitats directive water framework directive floodplain restoration flood risk management floods directive,The floodplain is the area next to a river bed which is more or less frequently covered with water in times of high water discharges from adjacent rivers.

"circular-economy-to-have-considerable  Circular economy to have considerable benefits, but challenges remain  The environmental benefits of adopting a circular economy in Europe could be considerable – reducing waste, and minimising the continent’s heavy dependence on imports of raw materials. A new report published today by the European Environment Agency (EEA) draws attention to both the benefits and challenges of such an economic transition. The report also describes possible ways to measure progress and highlights the areas where more attention is required from research and policy in order to turn the concept into reality.   The EEA report  Circular economy in Europe - Developing the knowledge base  describes the concept of the circular economy and outlines its key characteristics. Creating a circular economy requires fundamental changes throughout the value chain, from product design and production processes to new business models and consumption patterns. Recycling will turn waste into a resource and extending product lifetimes will help preserve natural resources. The  European Commission’s 2015 circular economy package  plays an important role in bringing this about.   ‘The concept of a circular economy has recently gained traction in European policy making as a positive, solutions-based perspective for achieving economic development while respecting environmental limits. The EEA is prepared to support the transition to a circular economy through analysis and assessments,’ said EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx.   Unlike the traditional take-make-consume-dispose approach, a circular economy seeks to respect environmental boundaries through increasing the share of renewable or recyclable resources while reducing the consumption of raw materials and energy. Emissions and loss of resources will thus be reduced. Approaches such as eco-design, sharing, re-using, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing products and materials, will play a significant role in maintaining the use of products, components and materials and retaining their value.       Key findings     The benefits of a transition towards a circular economy in Europe could be considerable, reducing environmental pressures in Europe and beyond and minimising the continent’s high and increasing dependence on imports. Increasingly, this dependence could be a source of vulnerability. Growing global competition for natural resources has contributed to marked increases in price levels and volatility. Circular economy strategies could also result in considerable cost savings, increasing the competitiveness of Europe’s industry while delivering net benefits in terms of job opportunities.       Challenges: As new circular approaches emerge, frictions between the existing linear system and the new approaches are bound to arise. These may be perceived as threats by some stakeholders, but as opportunities by others.       Good practice examples exist. For instance, businesses are already employing or experimenting with new business models such as service- and function-based business models and collaborative consumption. Governments increasingly foster waste prevention, reuse and repair.       A transition requires a substantial expansion of the knowledge base to chart progress and identify where more work is needed to achieve change. Some indicators exist already. For example, Europe is reducing the amount of waste generated and recycles more and more of its waste. But more information is needed to inform decision making and combine thinking about environmental, social and economic impacts. Better insight is needed in production structures and functions, consumption dynamics, finance and fiscal mechanisms, as well as triggers and pathways for technological and social innovations.     ecodesign critical raw materials green economy consumption circular economy recycling resource efficiency waste,The EEA report Circular economy in Europe - Developing the knowledge base describes the concept of the circular economy and outlines its key characteristics.

"assessment  Air pollution due to ozone:  health impacts and effects of climate change        There was no discernible trend in European ozone concentrations between 2003 and 2012, in terms of the annual mean of the daily maximum eight hour average measured at any type of station.   It is difficult to attribute observed ozone exceedences, or changes therein, to individual causes such as climate change.   Future climate change is expected to increase ozone concentrations, but this increase should not exceed 5 g/m 3  by the middle of the century and would therefore likely be outweighed by reductions in ozone levels due to planned future emissions reductions.    End of the century projections for the effects of climate change involve an increase of up to 8 g/m 3    in ozone concentrations  .      air pollution ozone concentrations emissions strategies climate mitigation ozone climate change o3       CLIM CLIM006 006,Past trends Between 2003 and 2012, there was no clear trend in the annual mean of the daily maximum eight hour average ozone concentrations, recorded at different types of station(traffic, urban, rural and other, mainly industrial), for the EU-28 as a whole (Figure 1). Meteorological variability and climate change, as well as increasing emissions of biogenic non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) during wildfires, could play a role in this lack of trends. Increasing intercontinental transport of ozone and its precursors in the northern Hemisphere also needs to be considered(EEA, 2010a, 2010b). The formation of tropospheric ozone from increased concentrations of methane (CH4) may also contribute to the sustained ozone levels in Europe(EEA, 2012). The relative contributions of local or regional emissions reduction measures, specific meteorological conditions (such as heat waves), the hemispheric transport of air pollution and emissions from natural sources (such as wildfires), on overall ozone concentrations is difficult to estimate. Temperature plays a role in various processes that directly affect the formation of ozone, such as the emission of biogenic NMVOCs i.e. isoprene, and the photo-dissociation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). According to the EEA indicator 'Exceedance of air quality limit values in urban areas' (CSI 004), between 2000 and 2013, a significant proportion of the urban population in the EU-28 was exposed to ambient ozone concentrations above the European Union target value for the protection of human health. The maximum was registered in 2003 (58 %) and the minimum in 2012 (14 %) The numbers of people exposed are higher in relation to the more stringent World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, where they have been in the range of 93  99 %, with no discernible change over time. Projections Climate change is expected to affect future ozone concentrations due to changes in meteorological conditions, as well as due to increased emissions of specific ozone precursors (e.g. increased isoprene from vegetation under higher temperatures) and/or emissions from wildfires that can increase under periods of extensive drought. Most of the links between individual climate factors and ozone formation are well understood (see Table below, based in Jacob and Winner, 2009; Royal Society, 2008). Nevertheless, quantification of future levels of ground-level ozone remains uncertain due to the complex interaction of these processes.      Increase in ...    Results in ...

It is only over the northern British Isles and Scandinavia that decreases can be found. Otherwise, over most of Central and Southern Europe, the increase is statistically significant and robust. For average ozone (maps on the left in figure 2), the increase is of the order of 2-3 g.m-3 and only reaches 5 g.m-3 over the Po Valley. Ozone peaks (maps on the right in figure 2) are found to be more sensitive, with increases of 5 g.m-3 over Spain and Italy, as well as over populated areas of France, Germany, Belgium and scattered areas of Eastern Europe. Given the levels of background ozone, in relative terms, climate change is expected to contribute to an increase of about 2-5 %, reaching 7 % locally for ozone peaks. Figure 3 shows climate change projections for the end of the century (2071-2100), where the magnitude of the impacts of climate change in terms of European surface ozone increases substantially. Summertime average ozone increases by 6 g/m3 or more (or about 10 %) over most of continental Europe, and a similar increase for ozone peaks is found over polluted areas. Preliminary results (Fig 4, adapted from Colette et al., 2013) also indicate that by the middle of the century, envisaged measures to reduce emissions of ozone precursors will have a much larger effect on concentrations of ground-level ozone than climate change. In the shorter term, the contribution of climate change is smaller, and it is not yet possible to assess the contribution of air quality legislation over the longer term. Such results are obtained by performing air quality modelling sensitivity experiments with a combination of contributing factors frozen to their present or future conditions. Such contributing factors can be: (i) climate change, (ii) emission of air pollutants, (iii) long range transport, each of which are required to perform long term air quality simulations. Approximately one hundred years of simulation were required for such an assessment given the number of combinations required to explore various possible options, and the fact that in a climate context multi-annual simulations are needed. The computational cost of such assessment is such that, up to now, only a few similar attempts have been made. This makes uncertainty analysis difficult, hence the preliminary character of the results presented here. Figure 4 shows that climate change (orange box), combined with emissions reductions (blue box) will influence future levels of ground-level ozone. Whereas for both reference and mitigation scenarios, climate change constitutes a penalty (orange box in the right part of the graph), its magnitude is much smaller than the benefit brought about by current air quality legislation (blue box in the left part of the graph). The role of intercontinental transport (pink box) is crucial and can drastically change the net result in Europe depending on the global climate and emissions pathways (penalty in the reference scenario and benefit in the mitigation one).

"assessment  Marine protected areas in Europe's seas   By the end of 2012, EU Member States had designated 5.9 %, or a total of 338 000 km 2 , of their seas as part of a complex network of marine protected areas.   As such, the EU had not reached Aichi target 11 of 10 % coverage of its seas. However, the target was reached in certain regional seas (Baltic Sea, the Greater North Sea including the Kattegat and the English Channel, and the Western Mediterranean Sea)   marine protected areas MAR MAR004 004,Coverage of marine protected area networks In 2012, marine protected area (MPA) networks covered almost 340 000 km2, or 5.9 % ofEurope's seas (Fig. 1). A substantialnumber of new national sites are being added,including significant numbers in British, Spanishand Portuguese waters. These additional sites willbe bringing EU MPA coverage significantly closerto the Convention on Biological Diversity target of 10 % coverage of MPAs. This figure excludes 'other effective areabased conservation/spatial protection measures'. Distance to Aichi target of 10 % coverage In regional seas, only three out of ten European regional seas, namely the Baltic Sea, the Greater North Sea and the Western Mediterranean Sea, have so far met the Aichi target of 10 % coverage (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). However, if the regional sea MPA network coverage is measured with respect to the three buffer distance belts (0-1 NM, 1-12 NM, 12 NM-END, (NM = nautical miles, END = outer limit of MPA assessment area), large differences in coverage are observed between coastal and off shore waters. The 10 % coverage target has been achieved in the near shore area (0-1 NM) in all regional seas.Closer analysis shows differences in reaching the Aichi target in the remaining parts of territorial waters (1-12 NM):three out of eight regional seas reach the 10 % coverage (the Greater North Sea, the Bay of Biscay and Iberian coast, and the Western Mediterranean Sea). Only two regional seas (the Greater North Sea and the Western Mediterranean Sea) reach 10 % coverage in offshore areas (12 NM-END). These results indicate that conservation efforts in establishing MPAs have been applied more in coastal waters than in offshore waters. Overall, since 1992, the EU has put a lot of effort into establishing MPAnetworks and with considerable success.Networks have been created at national, regional andEuropean level. European countries have even expandedefforts internationally and agreed to create MPAs inthe High Seas. However, the rationale underpinning thedesignations and their specific objectives is often relatedto a specific site rather than the network as a whole (EEA, 2015). References EEA, 2015.

"climate-agreement-towards-a-low  Climate agreement: towards a low-carbon, climate resilient world  The climate deal agreed in Paris by 195 countries is the first-ever universal and legally binding agreement of its kind. The Paris agreement is the result of many years of preparation, dialogue and growing awareness of the need to tackle current and potential impacts of climate change. It constitutes a major and promising step towards building a low-carbon and climate-resilient world. It also sends a clear signal to policy makers and businesses to move away from fossil fuels and invest in clean energy and adaptation actions.   Over recent decades, the growing body of scientific evidence has confirmed that anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are causing global average temperatures to rise. This global warming has in turn increased the severity and frequency of extreme weather events, caused sea levels to rise, exerted unprecedented pressures on the natural environment, society, and on human health. Built on growing public awareness and mobilisation, the  Paris agreement  consists of a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2°C and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.   Transparency and accountability   Ahead of the Paris conference, countries submitted their ‘intended nationally determined contributions’ (INDCs), outlining their commitments to tackle climate change. But the INDCs submitted by 186 parties are not enough to keep the global average temperature increase below 2°C by the end of the century. It is clear that much more needs to be done to meet the long-term objective both globally and in Europe. The Paris agreement recognises the need for additional effort. To this end, governments agreed to come together every five years to set more ambitious targets as required by science.   Countries also agreed to report their progress in implementing their targets, and to ensure transparency and oversight. A robust transparency and accountability system will track progress towards the long-term goal. The Paris agreement also focuses on solidarity in the fight against climate change. The  European Union  and other developed countries will continue to support climate action to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change impacts in vulnerable developing countries.   The latest projections by EU Member States, included in our ‘ Trends and projections in Europe 2015 ’ report, show that the European Union is heading for a 24% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 with current measures in place, and a 25% reduction with additional measures already being planned in Member States. However, our analysis also shows that to meet the target of a 40% reduction by 2030, new policies need to be put in place.   Europe also needs to boost its adaptation efforts. A European Union-level adaptation strategy is already in place to help countries plan their adaptation activities, and more than 20 European countries have adopted  national adaptation strategies . According to  a recent EEA report , most countries stated that extreme weather events have triggered adaptation responses. The second most cited reason for developing national adaptation policies was European Union policies integrating climate change adaptation, followed by damage costs and scientific research. An  EEA report  published this year shows that about 14 countries have systems in place or are developing these for monitoring, reporting or evaluation of national adaptation policies.   Investing in green solutions   A key component of the Paris agreement is the transition towards clean energy, which calls for investments to be channelled away from polluting fossil fuels towards clean energy sources, worldwide and also in Europe. This will need strong involvement not only of countries but also of cities, businesses and civil society.   A carbon-free energy system would certainly will be a cornerstone of global efforts to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But these efforts should be seen in the context of living within the limits of our planet. In its  7 th  Environment Action Programme , the European Union defines its long-term objective: ‘In 2050, we live well, within the planet’s ecological limits. Our prosperity and healthy environment stem from an innovative, circular economy where nothing is wasted and where natural resources are managed sustainably, and biodiversity is protected, valued and restored in ways that enhance our society’s resilience. Our low-carbon growth has long been decoupled from resource use, setting the pace for a safe and sustainable global society.’   Tackling the sustainability issue requires a system-based approach, which looks at key systems, such as food, energy, mobility, and housing, as interconnected parts of a whole.

This global warming has in turn increased the severity and frequency of extreme weather events, caused sea levels to rise, exerted unprecedented pressures on the natural environment, society, and on human health. Built on growing public awareness and mobilisation, the Paris agreement consists of a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2°C and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. Transparency and accountability Ahead of the Paris conference, countries submitted their ‘intended nationally determined contributions’ (INDCs), outlining their commitments to tackle climate change. But the INDCs submitted by 186 parties are not enough to keep the global average temperature increase below 2°C by the end of the century. It is clear that much more needs to be done to meet the long-term objective both globally and in Europe. The Paris agreement recognises the need for additional effort. To this end, governments agreed to come together every five years to set more ambitious targets as required by science. Countries also agreed to report their progress in implementing their targets, and to ensure transparency and oversight. A robust transparency and accountability system will track progress towards the long-term goal. The Paris agreement also focuses on solidarity in the fight against climate change. The European Union and other developed countries will continue to support climate action to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change impacts in vulnerable developing countries. The latest projections by EU Member States, included in our ‘Trends and projections in Europe 2015’ report, show that the European Union is heading for a 24% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 with current measures in place, and a 25% reduction with additional measures already being planned in Member States. However, our analysis also shows that to meet the target of a 40% reduction by 2030, new policies need to be put in place. Europe also needs to boost its adaptation efforts. A European Union-level adaptation strategy is already in place to help countries plan their adaptation activities, and more than 20 European countries have adopted national adaptation strategies. According to a recent EEA report, most countries stated that extreme weather events have triggered adaptation responses. The second most cited reason for developing national adaptation policies was European Union policies integrating climate change adaptation, followed by damage costs and scientific research. An EEA report published this year shows that about 14 countries have systems in place or are developing these for monitoring, reporting or evaluation of national adaptation policies. Investing in green solutions A key component of the Paris agreement is the transition towards clean energy, which calls for investments to be channelled away from polluting fossil fuels towards clean energy sources, worldwide and also in Europe. This will need strong involvement not only of countries but also of cities, businesses and civil society. A carbon-free energy system would certainly will be a cornerstone of global efforts to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But these efforts should be seen in the context of living within the limits of our planet. In its 7th Environment Action Programme, the European Union defines its long-term objective: ‘In 2050, we live well, within the planet’s ecological limits.

"assessment-1  Emissions of the main air pollutants in Europe     Anthropogenic emissions of the main air pollutants decreased significantly in most EEA-33 member countries between 1990 and 2013:    Nitrogen oxides (NO x ) emissions decreased by 49 % (54 % in the EU-28);   Sulphur oxides (SO x ) emissions decreased by 80 % (87 % in the EU-28);   Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) emissions decreased by 57 % (59 % in the EU-28);   Ammonia (NH 3 ) emissions decreased by 15 % (27 % in the EU-28); and   Fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) emissions decreased by 34 % (34 % in the EU-28).           The EU-28 met its continuing obligation to maintain emissions of NO x , SO x , NH 3 and NMVOC below legally binding targets as specified by the National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD). However, a number of individual Member States reported emissions above their NECD emission ceilings: six for NO X  (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland and Luxembourg), six for NH 3  (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands and Spain) and three for NMVOCs (Denmark, Germany and Ireland). There are no emission ceilings for primary PM 2.5 .       Three additional EEA member countries have emission ceilings for 2010 set in the Gothenburg Protocol under the 1979 UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland). Liechtenstein reported emissions above their NO x  ceiling. Liechtenstein and Norway reported emissions above their NH 3  ceiling.    Emissions reduction commitments for 2020 have been set under the 2012 amended Gothenburg Protocol for NO  x  , SO 2 , NMVOC, NH 3 , and PM  2.5  . The EU-28 as a whole is on track to meet its reduction commitments.      europe trends emissions by sector group main air pollutant emissions 2012     CSI CSI040 APE APE010 040 010,The National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD) and the Gothenburg Protocol under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention) set emission ceilings for European countries for sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), and ammonia (NH3). The NECD emission ceilings had to be met by 2010 and for years thereafter. The 2012 amended Gothenburg Protocol sets 2010 and 2020 ceilings for these same four pollutants, and for 2020 it also includes ceilings for primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions (see Indicator Specification for details). The aim of the NECD and the Gothenburg Protocol is to restrict emissions of selected air pollutants, which include ozone and particulate matter (PM) precursors and those that contribute to ecosystem acidification and eutrophication. Information on the exceedance of air quality standards for the protection of human health and the exposure of ecosystems to acidification, eutrophication and ozone is available from the EEA indicators CSI004 and CSI005, respectively. In 2013, 24 countries reported emissions above their 2020 NOx reduction commitments set in the NECD, 19 above the NH3 ceiling, 20 above the NMVOCs ceiling, 13 above the SO2 ceiling and 23 above the PM2.5 ceiling. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) NOx emissions for the EEA-33 and the EU-28 continue to decrease, and are now about half of their 1990 level. This reduction has primarily been due to the introduction of three way catalytic converters for cars. However, emissions reductions from modern vehicles have not been as large as originally foreseen. This is because real-world driving emissions - especially for diesel vehicles - can, on average, be four or five times higher than the European emissions standards for each vehicle type currently tested in Europe, using an outdated testing procedure. Sulphur dioxides (SOx) In 2013, SOx emissions were approximately 13 % of their 1990 levels for the EU-28. Emissions continue to fall, and for the EEA-33 they were 20 % of 1990 emissions. All countries continue to meet their 2010 emission ceiling commitments. Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) NMVOC emissions for the EEA-33 and the EU-28 have fallen to less than half their 1990 levels, and nearly all countries have reported emissions below their 2010 emission ceilings. Ammonia (NH3) NH3 emissions have fallen less than those of the other NECD pollutants. They fell by about a quarter from their value in 1990 for the EU-28, and by 15 % for the EEA-33. The majority of countries have reported meeting their NECD 2010 emission ceiling commitments. Particulate matter (PM2.5) Emissions of primary PM2.5 have reduced by about a third for both the EEA-33 and the EU-28 compared to their 1990 levels. The timeline of emissions reductions shows that the EU-28 as a whole is on track towards achieving the total reduction target implied by the Protocol. The country specific PM2.5 timelines suggest that not all countries (approximately one third) are on-track to individually meet their commitments by 2020. These countries may therefore need to implement emissions reduction measures beyond those currently in place.,Various European legal instruments address air pollutant emissions from different sources (for details see Indicator Specification). The newer Member States of the European Union have, in a number of cases, undergone major economic structural changes since the early 1990s, which led to significant reductions in those years. These changes led, in many instances, to a general decline in some activities that previously contributed significantly to total emissions of air pollutants (e.g. heavy industry), the closure of older, less efficient, power plants etc. Over recent years there has also been a modernisation of the road vehicle fleet, with more vehicles with improved emissions control introduced. Sulphur oxides (SOx) Emissions of SOx are dominated by emissions from the 'Energy production and distribution' sector, which typically accounts for more than 50 % of the total emissions from the EEA-33. This source has also been responsible for the largest emissions reductions since 1990. A combination of measures has led to the past reductions in SOx emissions:  Fuel switching:There have been substantial changes from high-sulphur solid (e.g. coal) and liquid (e.g. heavy fuel oil) fuels to low sulphur fuels (such as natural gas) for power and heat production purposes within the energy, industry and domestic sectors. Abatement equipment:Where high-sulphur fuels are used, flue gas desulphurisation equipment is now installed in new industrial facilities, and has also been retro-fitted to existing facilities. Improvements in energy efficiency:Improvements in energy efficiency have brought about decreases in the demand for energy, which has reduced associated emissions. Sulphur content of fuel:The implementation of several directives within the EU limiting the sulphur content of transport fuel has also contributed to the decrease.  Stationary combustion:Substantial SOx emissions reductions have been made across a number of sectors. The three largest sectors ('Energy production and distribution', 'Energy use in industry' and 'Commercial, institutional and households') have reduced by 80 %, 75 %, and 69 %, respectively. However, despite this, the 'Energy production and distribution' sector (encompassing activities such as power and heat generation) still remains the most significant source of SOx in the EEA-33 region, contributing over half of the total SOx emissions. Shipping:There is an increasing awareness of the contribution made by national and international ship traffic, and especially, whilst at berth, to SOx emissions and hence also to air pollution in nearby urban areas (a more detailed discussion of this issue is contained in the TERM indicator fact sheetTERM03- Transport emissions of air pollutants). Nitrogen oxides (NOx) Emissions from 'Road Transport' and 'Non-road Transport' account for over half of the current NOx emissions in the EEA-33. Road transport:Since 1990, a considerable reduction in NOx and other ozone precursor pollutants has occurred in the road transport sector, despite the general increase in transport activity within this sector over the period. This sector alone has contributed to over 40 % of the total NOx reduction. The emissions reductions have primarily been achieved as a result of fitting three way catalytic converters for petrol-fuelled cars (driven by the legislative Euro standards). Although the largest emissions reductions since 1990, in absolute terms, have occurred in the road transport sector, in recent years, ambient urban concentrations of NO2in EU-28 countries have not fallen by as much as reported emissions. Disparities between trends in NOx emissions and ambient NO2concentrations (seeCSI004) are due in part to the increased penetration of diesel vehicles, and the real-world emissions performance of modern diesel vehicles not showing the improvements that were initially suggested by the test cycle emissions factors used in emission inventories  although improvements have been made to many emissions inventories for the EU-28 countries in an attempt to address this. It is also due to the increased proportion ofNOx emitted directly as NO2from the exhausts of more modern diesel vehicles, which use catalyst systems for controlling emissions, particularly of particulate matter. Energy production and energy use in industry:Emissions of NOx have also declined in the 'Energy production and distribution' sector, and current emissions are approximately half of those in 1990. Furthermore, there have been substantial reductions in the emissions from Energy use in industry.These reductions have been achieved through the implementation of measures such as combustion modification (for example the use of low NOx burners), the introduction of flue-gas abatement techniques and fuel-switching from coal to gas. One of the most common forms of combustion modification is to use low NOx burners, which typically can reduce NOx emissions by up to 40 %. Flue gas treatment techniques (such asNOx scrubbers, selective catalytic or non-catalytic reduction techniques, i.e. SCR and SNCR) can also be used to remove NOx from the flue gases. Emissions of NOx are higher from coal-fired power plants than from gas-fired plants as the coal contains significant amounts of nitrogen (unlike gas). Shipping:There is an increasing focus on the growing relative contribution made to NOx pollutant emissions by national and international ship traffic (a more detailed discussion of this issue is contained in the TERM indicator fact sheetTERM03- Transport emissions of air pollutants). Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) Since 1990, a considerable part of the reduction of ozone precursor pollutant emissions (here NMVOC and NOx) has occurred in the road transport sector, despite the general increase in transport activity within this sector over the period. Road transport alone has contributed half of the total NMVOC reduction since 1990. These emissions reductions have primarily been achieved as a result of fitting three way catalytic converters for petrol-fuelled cars (driven by the legislative Euro standards). Road transport and non-road transport:Emissions from 'Road transport' and 'Non-road transport' combine to contribute approximately 15 % of the total NMVOC emissions. Emissions from the Commercial, institutional and households sectors make a similar contribution to the total. Solvent and product Use:The largest source of current NMVOC emissions is 'Solvent and product use' (approximately 40 % of the EEA-33 emissions total). Emissions have been reduced to less than two thirds of those in 1990. Important EU regulatory measures - the Solvent Emissions Directive and the Paints Directive -were introduced and have reduced the solvent content of products and reduced emissions from industries using solvents. Ammonia (NH3) Emissions ofNH3 have reduced by approximately 15 % (i) since 1990, due to changes in the agriculture sector. These have included a reduction in livestock numbers (especially cattle) and changes in the handling and management of both organic manure and synthetic fertilisers. Agriculture:Agriculture dominates emissions of NH3, they amount to 94 % of total emissions in the EEA-33 region. Emissions primarily arise from the decomposition of urea in animal wastes and uric acid in poultry wastes. Emissions depend on the animal species, age, weight, diet, housing systems, waste management and liquid manure storage techniques. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5)  Commercial, institutional and households:Emissions from the Commercial, institutional and households sectors contribute over half (58 %) of the current primary PM2.5emissions for the EEA-33. Within this sector, emissions are almost exclusively from households (over 95 %) ([i]). Current emissions are 6 % lower than those in 1990. However, the last several years have shown a general trend of increasing emissions from 2007 onwards, which has been strongly influenced by growing emissions of PM2.5from wood combustion in the residential sector. Energy production and energy use in industry:These sources only account for a combined contribution of current EEA-33 emissions of approximately 12 %, but they account for nearly half of the emissions reductions since 1990. This reflects several changes in the electricity generating and heavy industrial sectors. Fuel switching away from coal has reduced emissions of PM2.5, and the introduction of abatement equipment such as electrostatic precipitators also acts to significantly reduce the emissions of PM2.5. Road transport:Emissions from road transport contribute approximately 13 % of the total PM2.5 emissions in the EEA-33, but account for a quarter of the reduction in total EEA-33 emissions since 1990. This is a reflection of the improved emissions control technologies that have been introduced, particularly for diesel vehicles. [i]Emissions from Turkey were not reported."
"can-transport-come-to-terms  Can transport come to TERMs with its environmental impact?  With the recent publication of the EEA’s annual Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism (TERM) for 2015, and with international attention focusing on the ongoing vehicle emissions scandal, we spoke with the EEA’s TERM coordinator, Alfredo Sánchez Vicente.   What is TERM and why is it important?    TERM  is an annual EEA publication that investigates and reports on the progress of the transport sector’s attempts to reduce its pressures on the environment. It brings together the latest data on a number of key environmental trends with a view to assessing progress towards targets and enabling policymakers to gauge the success of their policies.    In addition, TERM tracks progress to the targets of the EU   2011 Transport White Paper   and other transport and environment-related policies and regulations, as well as focusing on a particular topic each year, for example urban transport or air quality.    TERM was launched in 2000, the first of a regular series or report, which are today widely disseminated among  EEA member countries .   According to the latest report, what are main issues concerning transport and the pressures it exerts on the environment?   Our assessments show that, in the form of air pollution, climate change and noise among others, transport continues to exert significant pressure on the environment and ultimately on human health. The environmental pressures from the transport sector depend on three main factors: the number and length of trips; the modes of transport used, where some are more environmentally friendly than others; and the technology that each mode uses. To address these, the report looks at the efforts made and the steps necessary to reach the 2050 targets for sustainable transport, highlighting the fundamental changes to be made in the way people and goods are transported.    Other challenges are discussed. As recent press stories on vehicle emissions have highlighted, there can be significant differences between official and real-world vehicle emissions, for a variety of reasons. Official tests do not reflect the full range of driving conditions, and have arguably led to engineering strategies that give good results under test-cycle conditions, but not necessarily during real use. We consider it important that planned improvements to the way vehicles are tested are introduced as soon as possible.       Electromobility also offers a potential solution to the transport related greenhouse gas emissions issue. The EU strategy to achieve a low carbon transport system relies on developments in non-internal combustion engine technology. However, despite growth, the share of electric (0.07% of the total passenger car fleet) and renewable energy powered vehicles is still very small, and it is likely that technological improvements alone will not be enough to meet Europe’s 2050 targets for lower transport related greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, until 2007, the impact of technological improvements on emissions was offset by increasing transport demand although emissions have decreased since then, helped by the fact that transport demand growth has slowed or decreased. However, preliminary data for 2014 indicates a slight increase, so, according to the EU’s own projections, the White Paper’s decarbonisation targets will not be met unless further ambitious actions put in place.    What is European policy on transport and the environment and what is being done at EU level to tackle the above issues?   EU policies have played a very important role in reducing transport related environmental problems. However, policies that aim to reduce the number and length of trips have been limited compared with those promoting more environmentally friendly modes, or those that improve the technology used in different transport modes.    For example, regulatory policies for emissions have been progressively tightened and have produced significant results, in particular by introducing limits for air pollution from passenger cars, vans and heavy-duty vehicles, and CO  2   targets for cars and vans.     In addition, countries are also required to use renewable sources for at least 10% of their transport fuel by 2020 and the development of clean vehicles and infrastructures is in focus. We have seen that alternative fuel solutions have been successfully demonstrated, but recharging and refuelling infrastructure is still a problem, rendering these vehicles less attractive to people and businesses.     The introduction of fuel quality standards in Europe has also led to drastic reductions in the sulphur content of road fuels and has helped practically eliminate lead.     But our TERM report shows that much more needs to be done.    How does the EEA contribute to this work?   The EEA compiles data, and produces indicator assessments and reports, which support the assessment of the environmental performance of the European transport sector. The TERM report and its associated transport indicators provide us with a system for regular monitoring and reporting of the effectiveness of integration strategies and progress towards sustainable transport. TERM also has an important role in signalling new data collection needs.    Beyond TERM, the EEA also carries out other transport related assessments on, for example electromobility, and transport and health issues. We also work together with countries and the European Commission to monitor the CO  2   emissions targets for new cars and vans, the status of fuel quality monitoring, as well as noise information, air quality data, emissions of pollutants from all sectors, greenhouse gases and more besides.     In this way, we help to build the knowledge base upon which further actions can be built.

"technological-solutions-and-behavioural-change  Technological solutions and behavioural change needed to decarbonise transport  While the transport sector contributes significantly to society and the economy it also can cause substantial adverse impacts on the environment, global climate and human health. A new report by the European Environment Agency (EEA) analyses key environmental trends with a view to identifying what has improved and what has hampered the past performance of the transport sector.   The transport sector affects the environment in different ways. It leads to emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and air pollutants, it is the main source of environmental noise and it leads to habitat fragmentation. The European Union has a wide range of policies from nature protection, noise, fuel quality to air quality, which have resulted in some significant improvements in environmental performance. For example, new cars and vans sold in Europe are using less fuel per kilometre, releasing less carbon dioxide and air pollutants. On the other hand, however, an increasing number of Europeans are buying cars, driving and travelling longer distances, and buying goods transported across the world.    The EEA's new report  ' TERM 2015, Evaluating 15 years of transport and environmental policy integration  ' analyses the evolution of the transport sector (freight and passenger) and its impacts on the environment since 2000, including the impacts of the economic recession in 2008. The report concludes that a fundamental decarbonisation of the transport sector will require not just technological solutions but also policies that stimulate significant behavioural changes, including the correct pricing of transport externalities and planning approaches that stimulate the use of sustainable modes of transport.     Selected facts      GHG emissions from transport increased by 19.4% since 1990. It is the only main European economic sector for which GHG emissions have increased.   In 2013, transport accounted for almost one-quarter of the EU’s total GHG emissions (one-fifth excluding international aviation and maritime emissions). Passenger cars contribute almost 45% and heavy duty vehicles a further 20% of the transport sector’s emissions.   As a result of EU legislation, transport emissions of three important air pollutants SO x , NO x  and PM decreased in the period 2000 to 2013 in the EU.  Particularly for NO x  from diesel cars, but also for CO 2 , there is an increasing difference between ‘official’ emission measurements compared to real-world driving emissions, an area of concern.   Road traffic noise, both within and outside urban areas, is still the most important source of environmental noise in the EU. Around 125 million people were potentially exposed to noise levels exceeding 55 dB Lden in 2012.   A sharp fall in freight demand occurred in the years immediately following the economic crisis and, following a limited recovery, freight volumes have since remained largely stable. In 2013, total freight transport was 7.3% higher than in 2000.   Passenger transport increased until 2008, but it has remained broadly stable following the economic recession. In 2013 the number of passenger-kilometres was 8.4% higher than in 2000.   Between 2000 and 2013, the proportion of diesel in energy consumed by road transport increased substantially. Financial incentives by many European governments have encouraged the uptake of diesel engines. The number of electric vehicles has grown but is only a minimal proportion (0.07%) of total passenger car fleet numbers.      Despite EU policies designed to encourage greater use of environmentally friendly transport modes, car transport remains the dominant mode of passenger transport. Air transport is the fastest growing mode of passenger transport.     Modal shift is a central element in the EU’s decarbonisation ambitions, as improvements in energy efficiency alone are often insufficient to reduce transport’s environmental impacts. Achieving the aspired modal shift would require significant investments in infrastructure, complemented by other measures to promote more environmentally friendly transport models. Innovations such as intelligent transport systems, new business models and autonomous vehicles may increase the future efficiency of the transport system.     transport emissions diesel decarbonisation noise pollution,The transport sector affects the environment in different ways.

In 2013, total freight transport was 7.3% higher than in 2000. Passenger transport increased until 2008, but it has remained broadly stable following the economic recession. In 2013 the number of passenger-kilometres was 8.4% higher than in 2000. Between 2000 and 2013, the proportion of diesel in energy consumed by road transport increased substantially. Financial incentives by many European governments have encouraged the uptake of diesel engines. The number of electric vehicles has grown but is only a minimal proportion (0.07%) of total passenger car fleet numbers.  Despite EU policies designed to encourage greater use of environmentally friendly transport modes, car transport remains the dominant mode of passenger transport. Air transport is the fastest growing mode of passenger transport. Modal shift is a central element in the EU’s decarbonisation ambitions, as improvements in energy efficiency alone are often insufficient to reduce transport’s environmental impacts. Achieving the aspired modal shift would require significant investments in infrastructure, complemented by other measures to promote more environmentally friendly transport models. Innovations such as intelligent transport systems, new business models and autonomous vehicles may increase the future efficiency of the transport system. "
"resource-efficient-cities-vital-step  Resource-efficient cities: vital step towards urban sustainability in Europe  Cities increasingly require and use natural resources and energy to sustain daily life and activities of the urban population. Their impacts are felt across the globe. But cities can also be designed and changed in ways to offer opportunities to reduce resource needs and environmental impacts. Three new reports by the European Environment Agency (EEA) take a closer look at what a resource-efficient city is and what cities can do to enhance urban sustainability while improving the well-being of their residents.   Three quarters of Europeans and more than half of the world population live in cities. They are places where people come together, work, trade, produce, enjoy social interaction, study and innovate. Like living organisms, cities require considerable flows and stocks of resources (such as energy, fuel, metal, wood, water, food, materials for buildings and infrastructure and land). After ‘use’, the residues are then discharged to the environment, in the form of air emissions, liquid and solid effluent and waste materials. These ‘outflows’ often exert significant pressures on human health and natural environments located well beyond the surroundings of cities.   Given their importance in our society and economy, increasing the resource efficiency of cities - producing greater economic value and wellbeing with less resource and less waste - would not only help alleviate the impacts on the environment and human health, but also support the transition towards a green, circular economy.    The three EEA reports ‘ What is a resource-efficient city ?’, ‘ Resource-efficient cities: good practices ’ and ‘ Enabling resource-efficient cities ’ address the following issues:     Why resource-efficient cities matter?   What are the main challenges and what can be done?   What solutions can be implemented on different scales (time and space) and across sectors?   What are the main drivers making urban transformation possible?   How can cities be governed to achieve the transition to resource-efficient urban areas?   How can the society be involved in the decision making process?     The reports conclude that an effective solution to urban sustainability requires an alignment of visions and strategies across governance structures, the implementation of which needs to be adapted to the characteristics of the city in question (e.g. geography, economy, climate, natural capital and social capital).   Selected highlights from the reports     Resource use per person in urban areas is actually lower than in sparsely populated areas. Higher population density, proximity to businesses, reduced transportation needs, all associated with well-designed compact cities, can boost urban sustainability.     To make cities more resource-efficient, different but inter-dependent components of the urban system, such as energy, housing, transport, waste management, public spaces, and green areas, need to be changed simultaneously.   The way cities have grown has had an impact on how people live, work and move. This has led to an expansion of grey infrastructure systems (roads, metro, railways, buildings, etc.). Green infrastructure planning would reverse this trend.    Governance and policy-making processes play a role in determining the ability to implement efficient integrated urban planning and to design a vision for the future.   The main challenge is to avoid conflict between actions taken at different levels and by different actors. Adopting strategic frameworks that set out targets for the future can act as a driving force for change.     Resource-efficient and sustainable cities are identified as a priority in a number of EU initiatives and policies measures, including the  Europe 2020  Strategy and the  7 th  Environment Action Programme .

"phase-down-of-fluorinated-gases  Phase-down of fluorinated gases essential to reduce effect on climate  Fluorinated gases (F-gases) have been introduced as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances in many sectors, but they contribute significantly to climate change. The European Environment Agency (EEA) has today published a new report on their production, import and export, which contributes to tracking progress towards their phase-down.   The new report  Fluorinated greenhouse gases 2014  shows the production, use, import, export and destruction of these substances in the European Union in 2014. F-gas emissions in the EU have grown by almost 60 % since 1990, and currently make up approximately 2.5 % of EU-28 overall greenhouse gas emissions (measured in 'CO 2 -equivalent' tonnes (CO 2 e) to be able to assess their effect on the climate).   F-gases were originally introduced to replace chemicals that were found to be harming the ozone layer. They are used in many different products, including refrigerators and air conditioning units.   New F-gas Regulation   European laws were recently revised and a new F-gas Regulation has been in force since 1 January 2015. This regulation, which includes a new quota system for the main type of F-gases (HFCs), aims to reduce F-gas emissions by two thirds of 2010 levels by 2030. Under the new legislation companies are obliged to report certain activities involving F-gases.   Key findings   The overall 2014 trends, based on company reporting on fluorinated greenhouse gases, can be summarised as follows:     EU production of fluorinated gases continued to decline for the fourth consecutive year since 2011. Production, measured in tonnes, experienced a year-on-year decline of 15 %, or 11 % in terms of CO 2 e;   Bulk imports  of fluorinated gases increased by 90 % compared to last years reporting (CO 2 e);   The high increase in bulk imports is mostly due to a 95 % increase in HFC imports, resulting to a large extent in HFC stockpiling in the EU;   2014 was marked by a 61 % increase in amounts of HFC being placed on the market. This is most probably due to stockpiling in anticipation of the HFC-phase down and quota allocations for placing HFCs on the market from 2015 onwards;   Bulk exports of HFCs continued to increase for the fifth year in a row. There was an increase of 22 % (tonnes), or 24% (CO 2 e) compared to 2013.     climate change hfc ozone-depleting substances f-gases flourinated greenhouse gases,The new report Fluorinated greenhouse gases 2014 shows the production, use, import, export and destruction of these substances in the European Union in 2014.

"waste-prevention-where-do-european  Waste prevention: where do European countries stand?  Every year Europeans generate more than two billions of tonnes of waste, which does not only cause environmental problems but also represents an economic loss. Waste prevention lies at the centre of the European Union’s policies on waste and Member States have a legal obligation to adopt and implement waste prevention programmes. A new report by the European Environment Agency (EEA) reviews 27 national and regional waste prevention programmes adopted by the end of 2014.     Although the overall amounts of waste generated in Europe declined between 2004 and 2012 by more than 1 % in absolute terms and more than 3% per person, 2.5 billion tonnes of waste —close to 5 tonnes per person— were discarded in the European Union in 2012. Reducing this waste can result in a wide range of environmental, economic and social benefits, such as reducing pollution in water and soil, greenhouse gas emissions and loss of valuable materials.    The overarching principle behind EU and national waste policies is the ‘waste hierarchy’. Waste prevention has the highest priority in the hierarchy followed by (preparing for) reuse, recycling, other recovery and disposal as the least desirable option. To this end, The EU Waste Framework Directive set the obligation for Member States to adopt waste prevention programmes by the end of 2013. The EEA reviews annually the progress towards the ‘completion and implementation of the programmes’. The  7 th  Environment Action Programme  also calls for a reduction of waste generated in absolute terms and per person.   The EEA report  ‘Waste prevention in Europe — the status in 2014’  is the second in this series of annual reviews of waste prevention programmes in Europe. The review process covers 36 programmes in the 28 EU Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The EEA report shows that waste prevention programmes show great variety in details, coverage, objectives, time horizons, targets, indicators, monitoring systems, measures and policy instruments. The report also includes examples of good practice from each country and region.   Selected highlights      The programmes cover a range of sectors and waste types. All of them cover sectors such as households and all except one the public services, whereas only a few programmes include the agriculture, and mining and raw materials sectors. The majority of the programmes address food/organic waste, municipal/household waste, waste electrical and electronic equipment, packaging waste and hazardous waste.    Most programmes mention the overall objective of breaking the link between economic growth and the environmental impact associated with the generation of waste.  Improving material efficiency, resource efficiency, decoupling of resource use from economic growth and preventing the use of primary materials are listed in several programmes. The reduction of harmful substances is included in more than half of the programmes.   Seventeen include quantitative targets ranging from total waste generated to more specific targets for particular sectors or waste types with different baseline and target years. Twenty-four programmes specify indicators for tracking progress on objectives and targets and, ultimately, on the effectiveness of waste prevention policies. Only ten programmes include explicitly monitoring systems. In some cases, monitoring is covered in other documents.   The analysis highlights a broad range of planned measures: 39% focus on the design, production and distribution phase; 40% are related to the consumption and use phase; and 21% focus on the general framework conditions of waste generation. Of the policy instruments included in the programmes, 63% concern information and awareness raising; economic and regulatory instruments account for 16% and 14%, respectively; and 7% voluntary agreements.     The actual effectiveness of the waste prevention programmes cannot yet be assessed.

"assessment-1  Fragmentation of natural and semi-natural areas     European core natural/semi-natural lands became more fragmented in most countries and on average between 2000 and 2006. Their 1 km 2  surroundings developed towards a mixed natural and/or some natural mosaic pattern with agriculture and/or artificial lands. During this time period, the loss of the core natural landscape pattern, due to the spread of artificial and/or agricultural areas, occurred particularly in parts of southern (southwestern Spain, southern Portugal, Sicily), western (Great Britain), central (western Austria) and eastern (western Romania) Europe.   In 2006, 35% of European forest lands were fragmented i.e. distributed as a mixed landscape mosaic pattern where forest is intermingled with natural/semi-natural non forested lands, agriculture and artificial lands in their 1 km 2  surroundings. On average in Europe, between the years 2000 and 2006, forests in a core natural landscape pattern became more fragmented towards a mixed landscape mosaic pattern, even if this trend was not observed for more than one third of European countries.   Although more than 40% of European landscape units reported a net forest area increase during between 2000 and 2006, only in one third of the units did this gain result in a significant increase in forest connectivity. In most countries, the trend of the units in a high connectivity range was either stable or showed a decrease during this period. Landscapes with poorly connected woodlands represented more than 60% of the EU in 2006.     connectivity/fragmentation of ecosystems biodiversity fragmentation of ecosystems forest landscape pattern connectivity landscape mosaic pattern connectivity / fragmentation of ecosystems       SEBI SEBI013 013,Patterns of natural/semi-natural landscapes (Figure 1) In Europe, the landscape mosaic pattern is changing due to two opposing landscape processes that are driven by either anthropogenic or natural factors. Such changes have an impact on the supply of ecosystem functions and services such as habitat provision, species dispersal, pollination, pest control or climate mitigation. Anthropogenic driven fragmentation factors are mainly the expansion of agricultural areas, transport infrastructures, settlements and the occurrence of fires. Defragmentation processes occur mainly due to natural factors like the increase of woody vegetation, which follows land abandonment. Spatially explicit information on the pattern of natural/semi-natural lands is also relevant to help to build a green infrastructure for Europe, which aims, amongst others, to develop networks of green, natural features, address impacts of urban sprawl and fragmentation, increase connectivity and improve landscape permeability. Between 2000 and 2006, the natural/semi-natural lands of a few countries developed more towards an unfragmented core natural landscape pattern, when considering their 1 km2 surroundings. However, this was not the case in most countries, nor on average at European scale. The loss of the core natural landscape pattern towards mixed and/or some natural landscape mosaic patterns, due to the spread of artificial and/or agricultural areas, occurred particularly in parts of southern (southwestern Spain, southern Portugal, Sicily), western (Great Britain), central (western Austria) and eastern (western Romania) Europe (Figure 1). Patterns of forest landscapes (Figure 2) In 2006, 65% of the European Union (EU 28 except Greece) forest lands were in a core natural pattern and 35% were intermingled with natural/semi-natural non forested lands, agriculture and artificial lands in their 1 km2 surroundings (Figure 2). 13% of woodlands showed strong fragmentation as a consequence of mainly intensive land uses (some natural forest pattern). Between 2000 and 2006, on a broad scale, the forest share of the core natural pattern tended to decrease on average over Europe, even if a positive trend was found for more than one third of European countries (Figure 2). Forest connectivity (Figures 3 and 4) The lack or loss of forest connectivity reduces the capability of organisms to move and can interfere with pollination, seed dispersal, wildlife migration and breeding. The European territory was gridded (25 km x 25 km) by landscape units containing forest. In most countries, the trend of units in a high connectivity range (>50%) was either stable or showed a decrease during the period 2000 to 2006 (Figure 3). Landscapes with poorly connected woodlands (<30%) represented more than 60% of the European Union in 2006, exhibiting the lowest shares in Slovenia, Finland and Sweden and the highest in the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland (Figure 3). While the causes of isolation may be natural and/or anthropogenic in origin, such landscapes deserve more attention in the future for species particularly vulnerable to the effects of fragmentation and, even more so, in the context of climate change. At a broad scale in the European Union, more than 40% of the landscape units reported a net forest area increase during the period 2000-2006 (Figure 4). In one third of the landscape units, this gain resulted in a significant increase in connectivity, while for nearly two thirds of the units it had no significant impact. This occurs when new forest areas are planted too remotely from other woodlands or when they only enlarge an existing wood patch. This finding supports the attention to forest spatial pattern and fragmentation related issues in sustainable forest management plans, which concern the landscape planning of forest operations, such as clearings and re/afforestation measures."
"assessment  Overview of the European energy system    The EU-28 is still heavily dependent on fossil fuels, but it is decarbonising. Fossil fuels (gas, solid fuels and oil) accounted for 73.8% of the total gross inland energy consumption in 2013 (83% in 1990), while renewables accounted for just 11.8%. Between 1990 and 2013, the share of fossil fuelsin the total gross inland energy consumption of the EU-28 decreased at an annual rate of 0.4% per year (0.6% per year between 2005 and 2013).     The efficiency of conventional thermal power plants has also improved from 42.2% in 1990 to 48% in 2013.In 2013, only 72.3% of the total gross inland energy consumption in the EU-28 reached the end users. Between 1990 and 2013, energy losses in transformation and distribution were about 27.7% of total gross inland energy consumption and did not show a significant trend.         The EU-28 is increasingly relying on imported fossil fuels from non-EU countries. The share of net imported fossil fuels in total gross inland energy consumption increased from 44% in 1990 to 53.2% in 2013. The EUs dependence on imports of fossil fuels from non-EU countries remained relatively stable between 2005 and 2013. In 2013,58% of total net imports was oil, 28% gas and 14% solid fuels.     energy consumption solid fuels oil natural gas    CSI CSI045 ENER ENER036 045 036,Conversion, transmission and distribution losses in the European energy production system  Public thermal power plants in the EU-28 had a net efficiency of 48% in 2013. The efficiency of electricity and heat production in public conventional thermal power plants in the EU-28 improved from 42.2% in 1990 to 48% in 2013. In the non-EU EEA countries, this efficiency improved from 34.7% in 1990 to 44.4% in 2013. Between 2005 and 2013, the efficiency of public conventional thermal power plants more or less stabilised in both the EU-28 and the non-EU EEA countries.   Transformation losses represented 21.3% of EU-28 gross inland energy consumption in 2013. In addition to generation efficiency, these losses are also influenced by the fuel mix (e.g. direct production of electricity from renewables, excluding biomass and municipal waste[1], is not subject to transformation losses in the same way as fossil fuels are), the level of electricity imports and the share of nuclear power[2].   The efficiency of the energy system (the ratio of final energy consumption to primary energy available for end users) varies considerably across Member States. Energy available for final consumption ranges from 96% for Luxembourg to 45.5% for Estonia. The low level of losses in Luxembourg reflects a significant degree of electricity imports from other countries (which means that the transformation losses involved in its production are not counted in the country of final use) as well as the fact that a significant amount of electricity comes from high efficiency gas-fired power plants with the remaining demand covered by hydro and other renewables. In Estonia, on the other hand, the main technologies used for power generation are low efficiency steam technology thermal power plants running primarily on oil-shale, which explains why more than 50% of the primary energy is lost. Losses from distribution in the EU-28are1.6% of the gross inland energy consumption. Distribution losses include losses in gas and heat distribution, in electricity transmission and distribution, and in coal transport. Although on average distribution losses aresmall, they are subject to sizeable variations between Member States (from 0.2% for Luxembourg to 4.5% for Denmark). Countries with a high amount of district heating tend to have higher overall distribution losses. This is because losses in heat distribution networks can be sizeable (in the order of 5-25%). Network (i.e. distribution) losses primarily depend on factors such as network design, operation and maintenance, but also on the population density of the country. Systems are more efficient when power lines to large consumers are as direct as possible to reduce the number of transformation steps (as these can account for almost half of the network losses - Leonardo Energy, 2008). Increasing use of distributed generation may be one way to reduce such losses.    [1] If the municipal waste is used for direct production of heat (or in CHP plants), the efficiency can be as high as around 90%. However, if the waste is used only forelectricity production, the efficiency is only about 30%. However, these plants are valued primarily because they offer an alternative to waste disposal so efficiency is not the main goal.   [2] In the statistics recorded by Eurostat, the ratio of primary energy to electricity production from nuclear is fixed at 1/3.  ,Energy mix in gross inland consumption and conventional power plants  The share of fossil fuels (coal, lignite, oil and natural gas) in the gross inland energy consumption of the EU-28 declined slightly from 83% in 1990 to 73.8% in 2013. During this period, the share of renewables in gross inland consumption increased by 7.5 percentage points, from 4.3% in 1990 to 11.8% in 2013 (see also ENER 026), while the share of energy consumption from nuclear increased from 12.3% (1990) to 13.6% (2013). In the EU-28, between 2005 and 2013 the primary energy consumption of total petroleum products decreased 2.5% per year, while that of solid fuels and gas decreased by 1.3% and 1.7% per year, respectively. Over the same period, the primary energy consumption of renewable energies increased by 6.6% per year. More recent trends show that the decarbonisation of the European energy system is continuing. Between 2012 and 2013, the primary energy consumption of fossil fuels in the EU-28 decreased by 2.4%, while that of coal decreased by 2.2%, gas by 1.7% and nuclear by 0.6%, whereas the gross inland consumption of renewables increased by 5.3% (see also ENER 026). For the non-EU EEA Member States (Turkey and Norway[1]), the gross inland energy consumption increased rapidly between 1990 and 2013 (by 107% or 3.2% per year on average), due mainly to an increase in Turkey (3.6% per year). The growth did not stop around 2005 as was observed in the EU. In Turkey, the consumption decreased in 2009 with the economic crisis (-0.2%) followed by increases of 2.7%/year since 2010.    [1] Data for Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland is not available.  ,Fossil fuel import dependency  Secure access to energy is vital for the functioning of the economy. In scientific literature, many different definitions of energy security have been proposed, and many indicators have been developed to quantify energy security (e.g., Grubb et al., 2006). Reducing import dependence is often considered as relevant for improving energy security. Dependence on imported energy may pose a risk to economic sectors, particularly in case these energy imports are from only a few countries. In general, the possibility of switching between energy carriers is very limited in many sectors, particularly over short timescales. In the past, various oil crises have demonstrated the vulnerability of the transport sector to oil. In response, members of the International Energy Agency must have a strategic petroleum reserve equal to 90 days of the previous year's net oil imports for their respective country to cope with supply discontinuities. More recently, threats to the supply of gas (via pipelines) have prompted investments in liquefied natural gas terminals across Europe. Gas is particularly important for the supply of heat to the residential sector, services and industry. Electricity production can switch more easily between fuels (e.g. between coal and gas). The EUs energy system remains highly dependent on imported fossil fuels (see ENER 026). The EUs dependence on imports of fossil fuels (gas, solid fuels and oil)from non-EU countries remained stable between 2005 and 2013, at around 53% (as a share of total gross inland energy consumption) (see Figure 2). The EU-28 relies much more now on imported fuels, compared with 1990 when only 44% of the gross inland consumption of all energy products was from imported fossil fuels. About 75% of the increase in net import between 1990 and 2013 arises as a result of the increase in imported gas. In 2013, net oil imports accounted for 87.4% of oil-based gross inland consumption plus bunkers, the majority of the imported oil is crude oil which is then refined in the EU (Figure 1). For gas, 65.3% of gas-based gross inland consumption was from net imports. Reliance on imports is lower for solid fuels but still significant. In 2013, 44.2% of solid-fuel based gross inland consumption came from net imports. Imports of petroleum products accounted for 58% of total net fossil fuel imports in 2013, followed by gas and solid fuels, which accounted for 28% and 14% of total fossil fuel imports respectively. The share of oil as a percentage of total fossil fuels imported has fallen since 1990, when it accounted for 71%. This is also due to a steep increase in the net import of gas resulting from increased demand from the electricity generation sector (see ENER 038). In addition to fossil fuels, Europe imports uranium for its nuclear power industry, which in 2013, accounted for about 38% of the world's civil nuclear power generation. The EU industry has the capacity to carry out uranium enrichment and fuel fabrication, but is dependent on imported uranium. In 2013, 27% of uranium delivered to utilities in the EU-28 originated from Russia, 17% from Canada, 13% from Niger, 12% from Australia and another 12% from Kazakhstan (Euratom, 2013). Imports of solid biomass in the EU-28 are small. In 2013, net imports of solid biomass amounted to 3.3% as a share of the total primary solid biomass consumptionand 0.2% as share of all energy products imports. "
"climate-change-adaptation-in-europe  Climate change adaptation in Europe: tracking progress and sharing know-how   An increasing number of initiatives and measures are being put in place to adapt to current and potential impacts of climate change at European, national, regional and local levels. It is now critical to understand better which actions work in which contexts and why. Where do countries stand in terms of tracking climate change adaptation in their territories? A new report by the European Environment Agency provides an overview of national monitoring, reporting and evaluation (MRE) systems in European countries.   Climate change impacts vary across Europe. Some regions are projected to face increasing water stress and drought, while others will experience floods. Different policies and actions therefore need to be put in place to meet adaptation needs and potential impacts specific to each area. To evaluate whether actions are effective and efficient, European countries need to collect and analyse information on adaptation policies in their territories. This knowledge allows for a better understanding of how and why certain actions work in certain contexts, which in turn supports the development of adaptation policies and measures.   The European Environment Agency (EEA) report ‘ National monitoring, reporting and evaluation of climate change adaptation in Europe ’ consolidates emerging information on MRE systems at national level in European countries. It looks at the most recent activities from European countries, provides insights into key aspects (e.g. drivers, governance, methodology and information channels) and reflects on current practices as well as on future issues that might be relevant for those working in this area. The report includes national-level case studies.   Tracking and evaluating adaptation actions   The European Union  ‘Strategy on adaptation to climate change ’ foresees that the European Union and countries monitor and evaluate the status and progress of adaptation. In this context, the EEA report finds that an increasing number of European countries have already taken action on MRE systems. As of October 2015, 14 countries had MRE systems in place or under development: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.   Most European countries with MRE systems in place aim to monitor and report on the progress that has been achieved in the implementation of actions and policies included in national adaptation strategies or plans. Some also refer to monitoring the effectiveness of the actions and policy implementation.   MRE of adaptation remains an emerging and dynamic field of practice where the experience of countries with more advanced MRE systems can be invaluable for those countries just beginning to consider building such systems. Experience in monitoring, reporting and evaluation in other new policy areas can also be relevant to the climate change adaptation policy domain since the challenges faced can be similar, for example in terms of data and information reporting availability and requirements.   The report complements the information available on the European Climate Adaptation Platform  Climate-ADAPT  and national websites on climate change adaptation. The report will be presented at the side event 'Europe adapting to climate change' during Resilience Day at the  COP21  climate talks in Paris.    evalution reporting monitoring guidelines on monitoring and reporting national adaptation strategies,Climate change impacts vary across Europe.

"co2-emissions-from-new-vehicles  CO2 emissions from new vehicles in Europe continued to decrease in 2014  Vehicles sold in the European Union in 2014 were, on average, 2.5% more efficient than those sold the previous year, according to a new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA). The report, which updates the preliminary data published earlier this year, tracks progress towards CO2 emission targets for new passenger cars and vans.   According to the EEA report  Monitoring CO 2  emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2014 , the average emissions of a new car sold in 2014 were 123.4 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre (g CO 2 /km), significantly below the 2015 target of 130 g CO 2 /km set for the EU as a whole. Similarly, the average emissions from vans sold in 2014 were 169.1 g CO 2 /km, below the 2017 limit of 175 g CO 2 /km.  Compliance with the EU fleet average targets is verified against the specific emissions targets set for each car and van manufacturer. The report shows that almost all manufacturers achieved their individual emissions targets set for 2014.    Key findings     In 2014, 12.5 million new passenger cars and 1.5 million vans were sold. Of these, diesel vehicles remained the most sold vehicles in Europe, constituting 53% of car sales and 97% of van sales.   In 2014, an average diesel car emitted 123.2 g CO 2 /km, just 2.5 g CO 2 /km less than an average petrol car.   Renault, Automobiles Peugeot, Automobiles Citroen and Toyota Motor Europe continue to produce most of the lowest-emitting cars.   Of the individual car manufacturers, Renault had the lowest average CO 2  emissions (108 g CO 2 /km) for new passenger vehicles registered in 2014. Renault also had the highest percentage of vehicles with emissions below 95 g CO 2 /km (34%).   Seventy percent of Toyota passenger vehicle sales in Europe were petrol cars with very low average emissions (110 g CO 2 /km).   Nissan has made the greatest improvement between 2013 and 2014. The average emissions from their passenger vehicles have decreased by almost 16 g CO 2 /km. This good performance relates to an increased number of electric vehicles in the share of new cars sold, as well as sales of smaller vehicles and the improved performance of conventional vehicles.   Of the larger van manufacturers, the Dacia fleet had the lowest average emissions  (132 g CO 2 /km), followed by Peugeot (147 g CO 2 /km), Citroen (148 g CO 2 /km) and Renault (149 g CO 2 /km).

"many-europeans-still-exposed-to-air-pollution-2015  Many Europeans still exposed to harmful air pollution  particulate matter air quality air pollutants air emissions health impacts      Air pollution is the single largest environmental health risk in Europe. It shortens people’s lifespan and contributes to serious illnesses such as heart disease, respiratory problems and cancer. A new report published today by the European Environment Agency (EEA) estimates that air pollution continues to be responsible for more than 430 000 premature deaths in Europe.   The EEA report  'Air quality in Europe — 2015 report'  examines the European population’s exposure to air pollutants and provides a snapshot of  air quality based on data from official monitoring stations across Europe . It shows that most city dwellers continue to be exposed to air pollutants at levels deemed unsafe by the World Health Organization (WHO).   The most problematic pollutants affecting human health are particulate matter (PM), ground-level ozone (O 3 ) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). Health impact estimates associated with long-term exposure to PM 2.5  show that this pollutant was responsible for 432 000 premature deaths in Europe in 2012, a level similar to that estimated in previous years. The estimated impacts of NO 2  and O 3  exposure were around 75 000 and 17 000 premature deaths respectively. The report also provides  estimates of premature deaths at country level .   ‘Despite continuous improvements in recent decades, air pollution is still affecting the general health of Europeans, reducing their quality of life and life expectancy,’ said EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx. ‘It also has considerable economic impacts, increasing medical costs and reducing productivity through working days lost across the economy.’   Alongside health, air pollutants also have a significant harmful impact on plant life and ecosystems. These problems, including eutrophication caused by ammonia (NH 3 ) and nitrogen oxides (NO x ),   as well as damage caused by O 3  to plants, are still widespread across Europe.    Other key findings     Particulate matter can cause or aggravate cardiovascular and lung diseases, heart attacks and arrhythmias. It can also cause cancer. In 2013, 87% of the urban population in the EU were exposed to PM 2.5  concentrations that exceeded the WHO value set to protect human health. The air quality standard in the EU is less strict and only 9% were exposed to PM 2.5  above the EU target value. The benefits of improving Europe’s air quality are clear – meeting the WHO air quality standard throughout the EU‑28 would lead to average PM 2.5  concentrations dropping by about one-third, resulting in 144 000 fewer premature deaths compared with the current situation. PM 2.5  refers to particles with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less. Small particles can penetrate deeply into the lungs.       Ozone exposure in cities remains very high – 98% of the EU-28 urban population were exposed to O 3  concentrations above the WHO guideline value in 2013. Some 15% were exposed to concentrations above the (less strict) EU target value for O 3 . Ozone concentrations also damage agricultural crops, forests and plants by reducing their growth rates and yields. The long-term objective for the protection of vegetation from O 3  was exceeded in 86% of the total EU-28 agricultural area.       Nitrogen dioxide affects the respiratory system directly, but also contributes to the formation of PM and O 3 . In 2013, 9% of the urban population in the EU-28 were exposed to NO 2  concentrations above the WHO and identical EU standards, with 93% of all exceedances occurring close to roads.       Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is an organic pollutant that is carcinogenic. Typically formed as a result of wood burning, exposure to BaP pollution is widespread, in particular in central and eastern Europe. A quarter of the EU-28 urban population were exposed to BaP concentrations above the target value in 2013, and as much as 91% were exposed to BaP concentrations above the estimated reference level based on WHO risk figures.       Sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions have been reduced significantly over past decades as a result of EU legislation requiring the use of emissions scrubbing technology and lower sulphur content in fuels. There were only a few exceedances of the SO 2  EU limit value in 2013.       Carbon monoxide, benzene and heavy metal (arsenic, cadmium, nickel and lead) concentrations in outdoor air were generally low in the EU in 2013, with few exceedances of the respective limit and target values set by EU legislation.      Links         EEA indicator on exceedance of air quality limit values in urban areas     EEA indicator on exposure of ecosystems to acidification, eutrophication and ozone     EEA   infographic   and   video   on health impacts of air pollution     European Commission information on   proposed measures to improve Europe’s air quality,The EEA report 'Air quality in Europe — 2015 report' examines the European population’s exposure to air pollutants and provides a snapshot of air quality based on data from official monitoring stations across Europe.

"assessment  Energy intensity     Between 1990 and 2013, energy intensity (the ratio of gross inland energy consumption and GDP) decreased by 1.7% per year in the EU28 countries and by 1.6% per year in the EEA countries. In 2013, energy intensity was 32% below the 1990 level in the EU28 and 30% below in the EEA countries.   During this period, the rate of decrease of energy intensity in the EU28 has been rather constant. The period 1990-2005 is characterised by relatively high economic growth and the more modest growth of gross inland energy consumption. The period 2005-2013 is characterised by much smaller economic growth and decreasing gross inland energy consumption. The resulting rate of decrease of energy intensity is rather similar in these periods.     All EEA member countries  [1]  show a decrease of energy intensity between 2005 and 2013, except for Norway (annually +1.6%), Estonia (+0.3%) and Turkey (annually +0.3%). The largest decreases were observed in central European countries (e.g. Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia) because of changes in their economic structure.    [1]  The 33 EEA member countries include the 28 European Union Member States together with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey.       gdp energy soer2015 european soer2015    CSI CSI028 ENER ENER017 028 017,Energy intensity in the EU-28  Between 1990 and 2005, a relative decoupling occurred in the EU28. Since the 2005-2006 peak in EU28 gross inland energy consumption, there has been an absolute decoupling between economic growth and gross inland energy consumption. In 2013, gross inland energy consumption in the EU28 was 8.7% lower than in 2005, while the economy grew by 5.7% during this period. In 2013, gross inland energy consumption in the EU28 was at almost the same level as in 1990 (see ENER 026), while Gross Domestic Product (GDP), measured in 2005 constant prices, grew by 1.7% per year. As a consequence, energy intensity in the EU28 fell by 1.7% per year during this period (see Figure 1). Between 2005 and 2013, gross inland energy consumption in EU28 decreased by 1.1% per year, while GDP increased by 0.7% per year. As a consequence, energy intensity in the EU28 decreased by 1.8% per year (on average) during this period. In 2013, energy intensity in the EU28 was 32% below the 1990 level. About one third of this reduction was observed between 1996 and 2000, a period dominated by economic growth and a more modest energy consumption. Average per capita gross inland energy consumption in the EU28 was 3.3 tonnes of oil equivalent (TOE) in 2013 (see Figure 2 (Table: Total energy intensity, relative energy intensity (as PPS) and per capita consumption). In the EU28, the observed reduction of energy intensity was influenced by improvements in energy efficiency - both for final users and for power generation - as well as by the increase of renewable energy in the power mix and by structural changes within the economy. The latter included an increase in the contribution of services to GDP and a shift within the industrial sectors from energy intensive industries towards less energy intensive industries that have a higher value added.   Energy intensity in EEA member countries  Except for Norway (+1.6%), Estonia (+0.3%) and Turkey (+0.3%), all EEA member countries show a decrease of energy intensity between 2005 and 2013. The largest decreases were observed in central European countries (e.g. Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia) because of the changes in their economic structure resulting from the closure of energy inefficient industries in the early 1990s, followed by economic growth in relatively energy extensive sectors during the 2000s. In 2013, significant differences in energy intensity[1] were observed between the EU28 Member States. The highest energy intensity was observed in Estonia, Finland, Czech Republic and Bulgaria. The lowest energy intensity was observed in Ireland, Malta, Denmark and Italy (see Figure 2 (Table: Total energy intensity, relative energy intensity (as PPS) and per capita consumption) and also ENER 016). In 2013, the lowest values for gross inland energy consumption per capita were observed in Turkey, Romania and Croatia (less than 2 TOE per capita in 2013), while the highest values were observed in Luxembourg (8.1 TOE per capita), Norway (6.7 TOE per capita) and Finland (6.3 TOE per capita).    [1] To enable the comparison, energy intensity was measured, in this case, in purchasing power standards relative to the EU28 average.  "

Since 2005, final energy intensity has decreased by 12% at an annual rate of 1.6% per year, resulting in an absolute decoupling between economic growth and final energy consumption. In the transport sector, final energy intensity decreased by 1.4% per year since 2005. Final energy intensity in industry, agriculture, and services and other sectors decreased by 2.3% per year, 1.6% per year and 1.0% per year, respectively, since 2005. In the household sector, final energy intensity decreased by 0.7% per year over the same period.   Between 1990 and 2013, final energy intensity in non-EU EEA countries also decreased; by 33.2% in Norway and 1.1% in Turkey. The decrease in Turkey is much smaller than in the EU28 due to an increase of industry energy intensity.   energy ENER ENER021 021, Between 1990 and 2013, final energy intensity of the EU28 decreased by 30.5% at an annual average rate of 1.6%. Between 2005-2013, final energy intensity decreased at the same rate (1.6%/year), while final energy consumption decreased by 0.9% per year and GDP grew by 0.7% per year over the same period. So for this period an absolute decoupling of economic growth from energy consumption can be observed. Improvements in final energy intensity were influenced both by structural changes in the economy, such as a shift from industry towards services and, within industry, to less energy-intensive processes and energy efficiency improvements (see ENER 016). In addition, the economic crisis played an important role in decreasing final energy consumption. Since 2005, final energy intensity in the industry and agriculture sectors decreased by 2.3% per year and 1.6% per year respectively. Besides an increase in economic productivity, the energy intensity decrease in the industry sector is mainly due to energy efficiency improvements (see also the ODEX in ENER 037) and, to a lesser extent, a shift towards less energy-intensive industries. In addition, industries in the EU are combining more and more manufacturing products with the delivery of related services. This trend leads to smaller energy intensities in industry, since gross value added increases without greater energy consumption. For agriculture, the main drivers are energy efficiency improvements and an increase in economic productivity. Since 2005, final energy intensities in the transport, and services and other sectors decreased by 1.4% per year and 1.0% per year respectively. Changes in energy intensity in services and other sectors are the result of counterbalancing drivers: an increase in economic productivity and energy efficiency on the one hand, and an increase in comfort (in particular with the diffusion of air conditioning) and in the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in offices on the other. The underlying factors explaining the energy efficiency improvement include an increase in insulation and the diffusion of efficient equipment for heating, air conditioning and lighting. The decrease in energy intensity in transport is down to different factors, including an increase of economic productivity and more energy efficient vehicles, driven by European policies aimed at reducing CO2 emission from transport (EEA, 2014a; EEA, 2014b). On the other hand, these benefits have been partially offset by modal shifts to more energy intensive modes of transport (increases in air traffic, the use of cars instead of public transport and the use of trucks instead of rail or inland waterways for good transportation).   Final energy intensity in the household sector decreased by 0.7% per year since 2005. This is influenced by several factors, which have opposing effects on energy consumption, such as larger dwellings, increased comfort levels, greater ownership of electrical appliances (which all lead to an increase in energy consumption), improvements in the efficiency of electrical and heating appliances and of the buildings envelope (which decreases energy consumption) (see ENER 037). Final energy intensity in the household sector is also closely linked with climatic conditions and population growth, as the majority of the energy is used for space heating. The data here is not corrected for the climate. For details on energy efficiency improvements in the household sector, please see also ENER 037. Final energy intensity rapidly decreased in most new EU Member States (see Figure 1): by more than 6% per year on average in Romania and Estonia since 1990, between 3% and 4.5% per year in Slovakia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Poland and the Czech Republic. This decrease was mainly due to energy efficiency progress and restructuring in industry. Since 2005, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria experienced rates of decrease in excess of 3% per year. These relatively large improvements in final energy intensities in these countries are in part due to substantial reductions in activity levels due to the economic crisis. Over the 1990-2013 period, the final energy intensity in non-EU EEA countries decreased by 33.2% (1.7%/year) in Norway, and increased by 1.1% (0.05% per year) in Turkey. The increase in Turkey is due to an increase of industry energy intensity. GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2.5% (Norway) and 3.3% (Turkey), while final energy consumption increased by an average annual rate of 0.7% in Norway and 3.4% in Turkey. Between 2005 and 2013, final energy intensity in Turkey continued to increase by 1.4% per year on average, but decreased by 1.5% in 2013. In Norway, final energy intensity decreased by 0.9% per year between 2005 and 2013 and by 0.7% in 2013. "
"climate-change-eu-shows-leadership  Climate change: EU shows leadership ahead of Paris with 23% emissions cut   renewable energy ghg emissions trend ghg emissions energy efficiency ghg emission targets      The European Union is on track towards meeting and overachieving its 2020 target for reducing greenhouse emissions by 20%, according to a report published today by the European Environment Agency (EEA). The 'Trends and projections in Europe 2015' report reveals that greenhouse gas emissions in Europe decreased by 23% between 1990 and 2014 and reached the lowest levels on record. Latest projections by Member States show that the EU is heading for a 24% reduction by 2020 with current measures in place, and a 25% reduction with additional measures already being planned in Member States. The EU is already working towards its 2030 goal of an emissions reduction target of at least 40% — the EU's contribution towards the new global climate change agreement in Paris in December.   EU Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Cañete said: 'These results speak for themselves: Europe succeeded in cutting emissions by 23% between 1990 and 2014 while the European economy grew by 46% over the same period. We have shown consistently that climate protection and economic growth go hand in hand.  This is a strong signal ahead of the Paris climate conference that Europe stands by its commitments and that our climate and energy policies work. And we have already taken the first steps towards implementing our Paris pledge with new proposals presented earlier this year.'   EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx said: 'Europe's efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy have resulted in concrete gains. Our report shows that the EU is on track towards its 2020 climate targets. The report also shows that to achieve our longer-term goals for 2030 and 2050, a fundamental change is needed in the way we produce and use energy in Europe.'   On track towards 2020 greenhouse gas target   The EEA report reveals that according to approximated (‘proxy’) estimates for 2014 greenhouse gas, emissions fell by 4% in 2014 compared to 2013. This was partly due to an unusually warm year, which lowered energy demand. This means the EU’s domestic greenhouse gas emissions were 23% below 1990 levels in 2014.   Latest projections by Member States  [1]   show the EU is heading for a 24% reduction by 2020 with current measures in place, and a 25% reduction with additional measures already being planned in Member States. The EU is therefore also on track towards its Kyoto Protocol target for the second commitment period from 2013 to 2020.   Progress towards 2030 greenhouse gas target   Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are projected to continue beyond 2020 but at a slower pace. According to projections submitted by Member States, planned reductions are estimated to bring emissions between 27% (with current measures) and 30% (with additional measures already being planned by Member States) below 1990 levels by 2030. New policies will therefore need to be put in place to meet the 40% reduction target by 2030. As President Juncker stated in his State of the European Union -speech, European Commission has already taken the first legislative step towards implementing the EU's 2030 targets with its proposal to revise the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS).

"protecting-marine-life-in-europe2019s-seas-1  Protecting marine life in Europe’s seas  Europe´s seas are under pressure. Marine protected areas (MPAs) can act as a key management measures to safeguard marine ecosystems and biodiversity so to maintain their potential to deliver key services to our societies and economies. European countries have been extending marine protected areas across Europe’s seas. More effective management of these marine protected areas and a convergent implementation of related legislation now constitute important challenges.  A new report by the European Environment Agency assesses the progress made and concludes with perspectives for the future.   The regional seas surrounding Europe include vast, open oceans as well as almost entirely landlocked seas, covering 5.7 million km 2 . They are home to a diverse range of habitats, sustaining thousands of species of plants and animals. This biodiversity is the foundation for marine ecosystems and their capacity to provide us services, such as climate regulation, sea food, or leisure activities like diving and whale watching. However, human activities at sea as well as on land are impacting Europe’s seas and putting pressure on marine species: damage and loss of habitats, extraction of resources, introduction of non-indigenous species, pollution and the effects of climatic change. The cumulative effect of these pressures is damaging the state of marine ecosystems. To safeguard biodiversity in areas vital for the health of the seas and to address increasingly complex threats to marine ecosystems, EU Member States have designated networks of marine protected areas.   Marine protected areas (MPAs) are in general defined as geographically distinct zones for which conservation objectives can be set and the management of which should be based on an ecosystem-based approach. They are often established to strike a balance between ecological constraints and economic activity. MPA networks are a collection of individual MPAs operating cooperatively and are designed to meet objectives that cannot be achieved by individual MPAs alone. An MPA network needs to be, among others, representative, i.e. protecting the range of biodiversity found in the seas.   How much progress has the EU made in designating marine protected areas? Can we assess if marine protected areas work? Are Europe’s MPA networks ecologically coherent and well-managed? The EEA report ‘ Marine protected areas in Europe’s seas — an overview and perspectives for the future ’ addresses these questions by providing an overview of MPAs in Europe´s seas and the relevant EU policy framework.  The report aims to support the     European Commission’s progress report on MPAs    .         According to the report, Europe needs to implement a more holistic approach to MPA design, management and evaluation. With   a better implementation of existing legislation across Europe’s seas, as well as more effective management  , MPA networks could play a crucial role in reversing systemic changes observed in Europe’s seas. They can help halt biodiversity loss, achieve clean, healthy and biologically diverse seas, and secure sustainability.   Key messages      Europe has extensive international, European and national policy frameworks to support the creation of MPAs. By the end of 2012, EU Member States had designated 5.9% of their seas as MPAs.     EU MPA networks cannot yet be considered representative or ecologically coherent.       The     Natura 2000 network     is the cornerstone of MPAs in Europe. Although the network at sea is not yet complete, it is considered a success. It targets a number of vulnerable marine species and habitats. It spans the marine territory of 23 countries and covers more than 4% of Europe’s seas.     The Natura 2000 network could benefit further from a full implementation of the EU’s Birds and Habitats Directives. In its current form, Natura 2000 is not set up to deliver an ecologically coherent and representative network in marine areas.     The four Regional Seas Conventions (covering the Baltic Sea; the North-east Atlantic Ocean; the Mediterranean Sea; and the Black Sea) are good platforms for developing and implementing an ecosystem based approach to the designation and management of MPAs.     Some EU Member States have designated additional MPAs under national legislation to better ensure representativity and ecological coherence.     In order to evaluate the effectiveness of EU MPA networks, information sources need to be better harmonised, science-based evaluation criteria need to be developed, and operational objectives need to be formulated.      Background on Europe’s seas   The EEA has recently published a comprehensive study on Europe’s seas. The ‘ State of Europe’s seas ’ report examines whether the EU is meeting its policy goals for the quality of the marine environment. The report shows that, despite some improvements, the way we use our seas remains unsustainable and threatens not only the productivity of our seas, but also our wellbeing. Human activities and climate change are increasingly putting a number of pressures on Europe’s seas, the cumulative effects of which threaten the functioning and resilience of marine ecosystems.

"forests-can-help-prevent-floods  Forests can help prevent floods and droughts  Forests can retain excess rainwater, prevent extreme run-offs and reduce the damage from flooding. They can also help mitigate the effects of droughts. A new report published today by the European Environment Agency (EEA) provides an overview of the water-retention potential of European forests.   One third of European territory is covered by forests (mostly managed) and approximately 296 million Europeans live in or close to forests. Forests are essential for human well-being and provide a wide range of ecosystem services to society, including water retention, defined as the water absorbed or used by forests.   The EEA report  Water-retention potential of Europe's forests shows that water retention has an important role to play in buffering the effects of heavy rainfall and droughts. A better understanding of this role can help develop measures to tackle the effects of climate change and extreme weather events.    The volume of water retained by forests can depend on characteristics such as forest cover area, the length of vegetation growing season, tree composition and tree density, as well as the age and the number of layers of vegetation cover. Water retention by forests affects the amount and timing of the water delivered to streams and groundwater by increasing and maintaining infiltration and storage capacity of the soil. Forests can soak up excess rainwater, preventing run-offs and damage from flooding. By releasing water in the dry season, forests can also help provide clean water and mitigate the effects of droughts.     The report shows that water retention potential tends to increase along with the extent of forest cover in a water basin. Compared to basins with a forest cover of 10%, total water retention is 25% and 50% higher in water basins where the forest cover is more than 30% and 70%, respectively.     Irrespective of the extent of the basins forest cover, water retention is typically about 25% greater in summer time than in winter time and that coniferous forests in general retain 10% more water than broadleaved forests or mixed forests. In general, forests in Alpine and Continental regions have the highest water-retention potentials, while Atlantic and Mediterranean regions register lower water-retention potentials.     The report suggests that despite its important role, water retention by forests cannot be promoted as a one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, water retention should be considered on a case-by-case basis according to local and regional ecological and hydrological conditions, as proposed in the  natural water-retention measures catalogue  of the European Commission.    forest management water retention forest nature-based solutions,One third of European territory is covered by forests (mostly managed) and approximately 296 million Europeans live in or close to forests.

"can-nature-help-reduce-the  Can nature help reduce the impacts of climate change?  Building and managing a well-planned network of natural areas might provide an effective and, in many cases, cheaper solution for coping with natural disasters such as floods or landslides. A new report published today by the European Environment Agency (EEA) explores how ‘green infrastructure’ can help Europe prepare for and reduce the loss from weather- and climate-related hazards.   Weather- and climate-related hazards, including extreme precipitation, floods, wet mass movement (e.g. avalanches and landslides) and storm surges are among the costliest and deadliest natural hazards in Europe and globally. The EEA’s new report ‘ Exploring nature-based solutions : the role of green infrastructure in mitigating the impacts of weather- and climate change-related natural hazards’ focuses on certain types of extreme events and hazards in Europe that are likely to be amplified by ongoing climate change.   As mentioned in the  Green Infrastructure Strategy , the European Commission defines green infrastructure as a strategically planned network of high-quality green spaces. In this study, green infrastructure is defined by its capacity to provide a relevant number of ecosystem services. The maps presented in this study provide an overview of where specific weather- and climate-related natural hazards are likely to occur, where well-functioning ecosystem services exist which can support disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation so as to lessen the impacts of natural hazards (e.g. floods and landslides), and where the provision of ecosystem services may be improved.   Green infrastructure solutions that boost disaster resilience are also an integral part of EU policy on disaster risk management. Climate change and infrastructure development make disaster-prone areas more vulnerable to extreme weather events and natural disasters such as floods, landslides, avalanches, forest fires, storms and wave surges that cause loss of life and result in billions of euros of damage and insurance costs each year in the EU. The impacts of such events on human society and the environment can often be reduced using green infrastructure solutions.   To address some of these challenges, the report proposes a simple, practical methodology for screening (rather than assessing) ecosystem services in areas where green infrastructure may contribute to reducing current (or future) weather- and climate-related natural hazards. The report addresses landslides, avalanches, floods, soil erosion, storm surges and carbon stabilisation by ecosystems. For each benefit covered, the report provides a short literature review, assessment and results, and the data sets used.    eu biodiversity strategy nature-based solutions green infrastructure urban,Weather- and climate-related hazards, including extreme precipitation, floods, wet mass movement (e.g. avalanches and landslides) and storm surges are among the costliest and deadliest natural hazards in Europe and globally.

The report considers the use of more than 200 chemicals controlled by the Montreal Protocol and EU legislation.   Over the last few decades, chemicals known to harm the ozone layer have been successfully substituted in most parts of the world since 1989 when the  Montreal Protocol  came into force. Within the EU, ozone depleting substances (ODS) are covered by the  ODS Regulation , which is more stringent than the rules of the Protocol and covers additional substances. Companies are obliged to report their use of ODS, including imports, exports, production and destruction.   The EU has implemented the phase-out of ODS use in line with the Montreal Protocol requirements over the period 1987-2010, which is 10 years ahead of the legal provision. The key metric under the Protocol to measure the use is ‘consumption’. It is calculated from the reported data on production, import, export and destruction.   The EEA report ' Ozone depleting substances 2014 ' shows that consumption in the EU was negative in 2014, as was  the general trend over the last years .  These negative values are the result of a phase-out in combination with rather high destruction and low stocks.   Since the potential to harm the ozone layer varies among substances, the data collected on these chemicals are expressed not only in metric tonnes but also in 'ozone depleting potential' (ODP) tonnes which show quantities in terms of their environmental effects rather than physical weight.

"towards-global-sustainability  Towards global sustainability  In August this year, more than 190 countries reached a consensus on the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. And later this month, Heads of State will adopt this Agenda along with its Sustainable Development Goals and targets in New York. Unlike their predecessors, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are both for developing and developed countries and focus on a broader range of sustainable development topics. Many of the 17 SDGs include elements related to the environment, resource use or climate change.   It is encouraging to see this global and more comprehensive commitment to sustainability. Recognising that sustainable development is both a challenge and a necessity for developing and developed countries is certainly a step in the right direction.   In this context, the overall objective of the European Union’s  7 th  Environment Action Programme  is in line with the SDGs: ‘In 2050, we live well, within the planet’s ecological limits’. A significant number of measures have been put in place in the EU to achieve this goal. However, the global nature of our economy and our environment makes it more difficult for countries or groups of countries acting together (such as the EU) to solve environmental problems on their own. For example, regardless of where they were released, greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global atmospheric concentrations, producing impacts far from the source — and potentially far into the future.   Without a global effort and transition to true sustainability, we risk undermining well-being and quality of life across the planet. Our report ‘ The European environment — state and outlook 2015 ’ (SOER 2015) shows that current consumption and production patterns enhance our quality of life — and paradoxically put it at risk at the same time.   Approaching limits   SOER 2015 also points out that there are indications that our economies are approaching the ecological limits within which they are embedded, and that we are already experiencing some of the effects of physical and environmental resource constraints. Available estimates suggest that total global consumption exceeds the planet's regenerative capacity by more than 50%. In other words, we are consuming more than what our planet can produce in a given period without weakening its production capacity.   Some  global megatrends  cause additional concern. Today, less than 2 billion of the global population of 7 billion are regarded as middle class consumers. By 2050, the number of people on the planet is expected to reach 9 billion, with more than 5 billion belonging to the middle class. This growth is likely to intensify global competition for resources and to exert additional demands on ecosystems.   Global materials use may double by 2030. World demand for energy and water are both projected to rise by between 30% and 40% over the next 20 years. Similarly, total demand for food, feed, and fibre is projected to grow by about 60% between now and 2050.   Escalating resource scarcities and increased competition raise concerns about security of access to supplies of key resources. Growing concerns about food, water and energy security have fuelled transnational land acquisitions in the last 5–10 years, primarily in developing countries.   Europe and global sustainability   The European Union is an important global player as a producer and a consumer. Most European countries’ ecological footprint currently exceeds their available biologically productive area, or 'biocapacity'. Moreover, given the EU’s trade with the rest of the world, a considerable share of the environmental pressures associated with consumption in the EU is felt outside the EU's territory. Furthermore, the share of the environmental footprint of EU demand that is exerted outside EU borders has increased during the past decade for land, water, and material use, as well as for air emissions.   In recent years, global environmental issues have been framed in terms of tipping points, limits, and gaps. This framing has not yet been reflected in societies, economies, finance systems, political ideologies and knowledge systems, which still do not operate with the idea of planetary boundaries or limits. However, our planet has limited amounts of key resources such as water and land.   In a global economic system bound by limited resources and faced with growing global demand and environmental degradation, a resource-efficient, green economy is the only viable option. A transition to green economy entails fundamental changes to the way we produce and consume goods and services, build cities, transport people and goods, grow food and so on.   Policies aimed at greening the economy do not need to be seen as hurdles or costly. On the contrary, they can be turned into opportunities. Many economic sectors in Europe have succeeded reducing material demand and emissions or breaking the link between economic growth and emissions. For example, the environment industry sector grew by more than 50% in size between 2000 and 2011. It is one of the few economic sectors in the EU to have flourished since the 2008 financial crisis.   Similarly, population growth and increasing competition for resources can also be seen as forces bringing about the necessary systemic change. To accommodate them, we can start by building spatially planned cities worldwide, with key systems, such as energy, mobility and transport, that do not exert pressure on natural capital and are as close to ‘zero-carbon’ and ‘zero waste’ as possible.        Hans Bruyninckx   EEA Executive Director    Editorial published in the  issue no. 2015/3 of the EEA newsletter , September 2015   green economy competition for resources sustainable development global megatrends population trends global resource exploitation sustainable development goals,It is encouraging to see this global and more comprehensive commitment to sustainability.

"green-infrastructure-better-living-through  Green infrastructure: better living through nature-based solutions  Green infrastructure offers attractive solutions to environmental, social and economic issues, and as such needs to be fully integrated across different policy domains. As the EEA prepares to publish a report on the role of green infrastructure in mitigating the impacts of weather and climate change related natural hazards, we spoke to its lead author, Gorm Dige, project manager for territorial environment, policy and economic analysis.   What is green infrastructure and why is it important?   The European Commission  Communication on Green Infrastructure  describes it as a tool for providing ecological, economic and social benefits through nature based solutions, for helping to understand the advantages nature offers human society, and for mobilising investments that sustain and enhance these benefits. In other words, it’s a network of nature, semi-natural areas and green space that delivers ecosystem services, which underpin human well-being and quality of life.    Green infrastructure can provide multiple functions and benefits on the same spatial area. These functions can be environmental (e.g. conserving biodiversity or adapting to climate change), social (e.g. providing water drainage or green space), and economic (e.g. supplying jobs and raising property prices). The contrast with grey infrastructure solutions, which typically fulfil single functions such as drainage or transport, makes green infrastructure appealing because it has the potential to tackle several problems simultaneously. Traditional grey infrastructure is still needed, but can often be reinforced with nature-based solutions.     For example, green infrastructure can be used to reduce the amount of storm water runoff entering sewer systems and ultimately lakes, rivers and streams, through the natural retention and absorption capabilities of vegetation and soils. Benefits of green infrastructure in such a case could include increased carbon sequestration, improved air quality, urban heat island mitigation, additional wildlife habitat and recreational space. Green areas also contribute to the cultural and historical landscape, giving identity to places, as well as to the scenery of urban and peri-urban areas where people live and work. Research shows that green infrastructure solutions are less expensive than grey infrastructure, and provide a wide array of co-benefits for local economies, social fabric and the broader environment.    What are the main issues facing the development of green infrastructure?   Green infrastructure is relatively new and complex, and there is no widely recognised definition. There is also a lack of quantitative analysis and indicators. As a result, policy makers struggle to integrate green infrastructure into the policy landscape. However, some green infrastructure features go against this trend. For example, ecoducts and natural water management systems, such as green roofs, tend to have clear functions and measures exist to assess their performance.    The financial case for green infrastructure can also seem complicated, but, in addition to providing multiple benefits, as seen above, it is often cheaper, more robust and sustainable. So instead of defaulting to grey solutions like dikes and pipes for flooding, planners should first look at the benefits of restoring floodplains or wetlands.     Finally, green infrastructure is anchored in the EU’s   Biodiversity Strategy  , but it’s more than just a biodiversity conservation instrument. It can make a significant contribution to the implementation of EU policy objectives concerning regional and rural development, climate change, disaster risk management, agriculture and forestry, and the environment.    What is European policy on green infrastructure and what is being done to tackle the above issues?   The EU’s  Green Infrastructure Strategy  advocates the full integration of green infrastructure into EU policies so that it becomes a standard component of territorial development across the EU. The strategy also recognises that green infrastructure can contribute to a range of EU policies whose objectives can be achieved through nature-based solutions, and places the use of green infrastructure in the context of the Europe 2020 Growth Strategy.    In addition, the Biodiversity Strategy aims to ensure that ‘by 2020, ecosystems and their services are maintained and enhanced by establishing green infrastructure and restoring at least 15% of degraded ecosystems’. It also calls on Member States to map and assess the state of ecosystems and their services nationally. This work will contribute to the assessment of the economic value of ecosystem services, and promote the integration of these values into EU and national accounting and reporting systems by 2020.     Green infrastructure is also recognised elsewhere in the EU policy domain, in particular in the   Seventh Environment Action Programme (7EAP)  , the   Regional Policy 2014–2020  , the   Water Framework Directive  , the   Nitrates Directive   and the   Floods Directive  , and the   EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change  .     All these initiatives will hopefully lead to improved use of green infrastructure as a policy tool and to practical solutions locally.    How does the EEA contribute to this work?   The EEA has engaged in green infrastructure research to support policymakers and the public. In 2011, we published the report,  Green infrastructure and territorial cohesion , which underlined the importance of developing tools to detect and measure green infrastructure, and provided input to national and regional priority and target setting. It also fed into the EU’s Communication on Green Infrastructure.    The EEA study,   Spatial analysis of green infrastructure in Europe  , evaluates green infrastructure as an ecological and spatial concept for promoting ecosystem health and resilience, contributing to biodiversity conservation, and benefiting humans by promoting the delivery of ecosystem services such as climate change mitigation, provision of key habitats to biota, and habitat connectivity.     A follow-up EEA report, Exploring nature-based solutions - the role of green infrastructure in mitigating the impacts of weather- and climate change-related natural hazards, is imminent.This builds on previous reports to demonstrate how green infrastructure contributes to mitigating adverse effects of extreme weather and climate-related events, which are among the costliest and deadliest natural hazards in Europe and globally. The report focuses on certain types of event that will very likely be amplified by ongoing climate change, i.e. landslides, avalanches, floods and storm surges. In addition, the report also touches upon the green infrastructure and ecosystem services contributing to global climate regulation.

"strengthening-cooperation-on-earth-observation  Strengthening cooperation on Earth observation and the environment  The European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding today, which sets out common objectives and areas of cooperation in the field of Earth observation and the environment over the coming years.    Satellite data, such as that provided by the ESA, is a key component of environmental knowledge. The broader view satellite measurements offer of a particular subject at a particular time have improved environmental monitoring, leading to more evidence based policy and, ultimately, better environmental management.   The Memorandum of Understanding sets objectives for the exchange of scientific expertise and technical information between the agencies, providing the basis for mutual access to data and the promotion of joint activities.   One new activity concerns the use of Sentinel-2A satellite data for the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service, which provides information on land cover and land change use as well as on variables related to vegetation and the water cycle. Sentinel-2A, which was launched on 23 June 2015, is the main provider of satellite data for the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service, which is coordinated by the EEA. Sentinel-2A’s spatial resolution and geographical coverage are designed such that the data it collects is optimal input for the envisaged regular Land Monitoring Service. The EEA will benefit from this data in many ways, not least for its regular state of the environment reporting, but also for applications that monitor Europe’s changing urban environment, the pressures and impacts on a wide range of habitats, the increasing fragmentation of the European landscape and climate change impacts among others.

"air-pollutant-emissions-declining-but  Air pollutant emissions declining, but still above limits  Emissions of most air pollutants decreased in 2013, confirming the long-term downward trend in Europe since 1990. But many countries are still exceeding internationally-agreed pollutant limits, set to protect human health and the environment, according to a new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA).   The annual European Union  emission inventory report 1990-2013 under the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution  (LRTAP) confirms a long-term downward trend for most air pollutants. For the first time, this year’s report also documents black carbon (BC) emissions, an air pollutant which is also an important short lived climate forcer.   Across the EU-28, sulphur oxide (SO x ) emissions have fallen the most since 1990 (87% reduction), followed by carbon monoxide (CO) (66%), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) (59%) and nitrogen oxides (NO x ) (54%). NH 3  emissions have declined less since 1990 than emissions of the other main pollutants (27%). The rate at which emissions are decreasing for these pollutants has, however, slowed over the last decade.   The  Gothenburg Protocol  to the UNECE LRTAP Convention contains emissions reduction commitments that have to be met from 2010 onwards for the pollutants NO x , NMVOCs, SO x  and NH 3 . In addition to emissions reduction commitments specified for individual countries, the protocol also specifies reduction commitments for the EU-15.   Further key findings      Emissions of primary PM 10  and PM 2.5  particulate matter both declined by around 20% between 2000 and 2013. For the 19 Member States that reported BC emissions for the first time, two thirds reported decreased emissions since 1990.   Emissions of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg), dioxins and furans, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have also dropped substantially since 1990, in the order of 70% or more.   The EU-15 met its limits for emissions of the four pollutants addressed under the Gothenburg Protocol. However, eight EU Member States exceeded one of their international emissions ceilings in 2013, while Austria (NO x  and NH 3 ), Ireland (NO x  and NMVOCs) and Germany (NMVOCs and NH 3 ) exceeded two ceilings.   Five Member States (Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland and Luxembourg) reported NO x  emissions higher than their Gothenburg ceilings while six Member States (Austria, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Croatia) exceeded their NH 3  ceiling. Three Member States (Denmark, Germany and Ireland) exceeded their NMVOCs ceilings.   The EEA member countries Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, also have emissions ceilings specified under the Gothenburg Protocol. In 2013, Liechtenstein exceeded two ceilings (NO x  and NH 3 ) and Norway one ceiling (NH 3 ). This year, Switzerland complied with all its ceilings.     Background information   Apart from the emissions of NO x , NMVOCs, SO x  and NH 3 , parties to the LRTAP Convention are required to report data for numerous other air pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM) and black carbon (BC), and selected heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The main air pollutants and their effect on human health and the environment are summarised in the EEA’s  Air Quality 2014 report .   The EU National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive contains ceilings that are either equal to or more ambitious than those set out in the Gothenburg Protocol. The EEA recently published its  annual assessment of the progress being made by Member States  to meet their commitments under the NEC Directive.   Air pollutant emissions data viewer   The EEA publishes the data from the inventory report in the  air pollutant emissions data viewer , a searchable web-based interface that simplifies access and analysis.

Five Member States (Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland and Luxembourg) reported NOx emissions higher than their Gothenburg ceilings while six Member States (Austria, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Croatia) exceeded their NH3 ceiling. Three Member States (Denmark, Germany and Ireland) exceeded their NMVOCs ceilings. The EEA member countries Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, also have emissions ceilings specified under the Gothenburg Protocol. In 2013, Liechtenstein exceeded two ceilings (NOx and NH3) and Norway one ceiling (NH3). This year, Switzerland complied with all its ceilings.  Background information Apart from the emissions of NOx, NMVOCs, SOx and NH3, parties to the LRTAP Convention are required to report data for numerous other air pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM) and black carbon (BC), and selected heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The main air pollutants and their effect on human health and the environment are summarised in the EEA’s Air Quality 2014 report. The EU National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive contains ceilings that are either equal to or more ambitious than those set out in the Gothenburg Protocol. The EEA recently published its annual assessment of the progress being made by Member States to meet their commitments under the NEC Directive. Air pollutant emissions data viewer The EEA publishes the data from the inventory report in the air pollutant emissions data viewer, a searchable web-based interface that simplifies access and analysis. The data viewer shows emission trends and graphics for the main sectors and allows for comparison of emissions from different countries and activities."
"assessment-2  Production, sales and emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases)    Since 1990, EU-28 F-gas emissions have experienced significant growth, more than offsetting an intermittent decrease between 1997 and 2001. While PFCs and SF 6 emissions have reduced by a significant degree, a major rise can be observed for HFCs emissions, which have almost tripled since 1990.   In 2013, the net supply of F-gases to the EU declined for the third consecutive year since 2010, both in terms of metric tonnes and CO 2 -equivalents. The 2013 net supply levels are slightly below the low levels of the economic crisis year, 2009. EU production appears to have stabilised slightly above 2008 levels after the sharp decline that was observed from 2007 to 2009. Imports of F-gases grew from 2007 to 2008, experienced a dip in the 'economic crisis' year of 2009 and have been on the decline from 2010 to 2012. However, in 2013 imports rose back to 2011 levels. Exports of F-gases have been on the rise since 2009 when expressed in metric tonnes, however, they are still below 2007 levels. Expressed in CO 2 -equivalents, however, 2013 exports dropped slightly.   Context: Fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) covered by the UNFCCCs Kyoto Protocol comprise hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 ).These F-gases typically have very long lifetimes in the atmosphere and high global warming potentials (GWPs). F-gases are mostly produced for use in products and equipment in the refrigeration and air conditioning sector, electrical equipment, foams, fire protection or as aerosols etc. Emissions take place mainly due to leakage during the use phase or due to failure to fully recover the F-gases at the end of the product/equipment lifetime. Future F-gas emissions are thus largely determined by (i) present day use of F-gases and (ii) measures to prevent leakage and encourage recovery.   ghg emissions fluorinated gases fluorinated greenhouse gases   CSI CSI044 CLIM CLIM048 044 048"
"soil-and-climate-change  Soil and climate change  Soil is an important — and often neglected — element of the climate system. It is the second largest carbon store, or ‘sink’, after the oceans. Depending on the region, climate change might result in more carbon being stored in plants and soil due to vegetation growth, or more carbon being released into the atmosphere. Restoring key ecosystems on land, and a sustainable use of the land in urban and rural areas, can help us mitigate and adapt to climate change.   Climate change is often seen as something that occurs in the atmosphere. After all, when plants photosynthesise, they draw carbon out of the atmosphere. But atmospheric carbon also affects the soil, because carbon that is not used for above-ground plant growth is distributed through the roots of a plant, which deposit carbon in the soil. If undisturbed, this  carbon can become stable, and  remain locked away for thousands of years  . Healthy soils can thus mitigate climate change.   When it comes to carbon storage, not all soils are equal. The most carbon-rich soils are peatlands, mostly found in northern Europe, the UK and Ireland. Grassland soils also store a lot of carbon per hectare. In contrast, the  soil in warm and dry areas in southern Europe contains less carbon .   Climate change puts soil under pressure   In some parts of Europe, higher temperatures may lead to more vegetation growth and more carbon stored in the soil. However,  higher temperatures could also increase decomposition and mineralisation  of the organic matter in the soil, reducing organic carbon content.   In other areas, the carbon-containing organic matter in stable peatlands is prevented from decomposing due to the low levels of oxygen in the water. If such areas dry out, the  organic matter can quickly break down, releasing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into the atmosphere .   There are already signs that soil moisture content is being affected by rising temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns. And future projections show this may continue, with a  general change in summer soil moisture over most of Europe  over the period 2021 to 2050, including significant decreases in the Mediterranean region and some increases in the north-eastern part of Europe.   The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere may cause the microbes in the soil to work faster to  break down organic matter, potentially releasing even more carbon dioxide . The release of greenhouse gases from the soil is expected to be particularly substantial in the far north of Europe and Russia, where melting permafrost may release large quantities of methane, a greenhouse gas much more potent than carbon dioxide.   It is not yet clear what the overall effect will be, as different regions absorb and emit different levels of greenhouse gases. But there is a clear risk that a warming climate can lead the soil to release more greenhouse gases, which can further heat the climate in a self-reinforcing spiral.   Agriculture and forestry to keep the carbon underground   Climate change is not the only thing that risks turning soil from a carbon sink to a source of emissions. The way we use land can also have a clear influence on the amount of carbon that the soil can hold.    Currently, the carbon stock of European forests is growing, due to changes in forest management and environmental changes. About half of that carbon stock is stored in forest soils. However, when forests are degraded or cleared, their stored carbon is released back to the atmosphere. In this case,   forests may become net contributors of carbon to the atmosphere  .    On farmland, ploughing the soil is known to accelerate decomposition and mineralisation of organic matter. In order to keep carbon and nutrients in the soil,  researchers suggest  reducing tillage, farming with complex crop rotations, using so-called ‘cover crops’ and leaving crop residues on the surface of the soil. Leaving crop residue on the surface before and during planting operations can help to protect against the risk of soil erosion. Such protection is essential given that it  can take thousands of years to form just a few centimetres of soil . Reduced tillage involves less breaking and turning of the soil. However, reduced or no-till methods are often associated with higher use of chemical fertilisers, which can have other negative effects on the environment.    Similarly, because organic agriculture uses manure inputs, it can rebuild the soil’s organic carbon deep below the soil surface.  Organic agriculture has the added benefit of cutting greenhouse gases  because it does not use chemical fertilisers. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization calculates that  CO 2  emissions per hectare of organic agriculture systems are 48% to 66% lower  than in conventional systems.   Interestingly, some forms of biofuel production may actually reduce the carbon stored in the soil. A  recent study  found that biofuels made from corn residue may actually increase greenhouse-gas emissions overall, because the organic matter is burnt as fuel rather than returned to the soil.   Overall, the adoption of appropriate farming and forestry practices offers enormous potential for restoring the soil and removing CO 2  from the atmosphere.   Protecting cities with soil    After homes in the Belgian village of Velm near Sint-Truiden were flooded  with muddy water five times in 2002, the residents put pressure on the local municipality to do something. Floods of muddy water had become a recurring problem in the area as water ran off bare fields, carrying sediment with it. To solve this problem, authorities looked to the soil to protect homes. They adopted a number of measures such as planting cover crops in the winter when the soil was bare and thus at risk of flooding. They also left crop residues on the field to reduce erosion. Such measures to restore natural systems have successfully prevented muddy floods between 2002 and the present day, despite several heavy rainfall events.     Flood regulation and prevention is just one of the vital ‘services’ that healthy soil delivers. We may come to increasingly rely on this service as extreme weather events such as floods become more frequent and severe.   There are many other ways that the quality of soil will dictate how climate change affects us. Permeable soil can also protect from heatwaves, by storing large amounts of water and keeping temperatures down. This latter point is particularly important in cities, where hard surfaces (soil sealing) can create the ‘heat island effect’.   Several European cities are trying to make use of these soil functions. For example,  Gomeznarro Park in Madrid  was restored to include new permeable surfaces, vegetation and underground water storage. This solution has been replicated elsewhere in Madrid and across Spain.   Restoring ecosystems   The latest evidence is clear: restoring some ecosystems can actually help capture carbon from the atmosphere. For example,  actively restoring peatlands  has proved to be a successful response to the loss of organic carbon that results from peat exploitation for energy use. The fastest way to increase organic carbon in farmed soil is to convert arable land to grassland, according to a  study from the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre .   Unfortunately, some recent trends seem to be going in the opposite direction. Between 1990 and 2012,  the area of arable land, permanent crops, pastures, and semi-natural vegetation decreased in Europe . More concretely,  ‘land take’ in Europe resulted in a loss of 0.81% in arable-land productive capacity as fields were converted to towns, roads, and other infrastructure  between 1990 and 2006. Such urban development projects often involve sealing the soil with an impervious layer. Food security concerns aside, this also means  Europe has a reduced capacity to store organic carbon, prevent floods, and keep temperatures down .   If managed correctly, soil can help us to reduce greenhouse gases and adapt to the worst effects of climate change. But if we fail to care for the soil, we may quickly exacerbate the problems connected to climate change.       climate change consequences climate change mitigation climate change adaptation signals2015,Climate change is often seen as something that occurs in the atmosphere.

"climate-change-and-human-health  Climate change and human health  Climate change in Europe is already affecting public health, and will continue to do so in the future. How does it affect Europeans today? What does the future look like? We asked these questions to Bettina Menne from WHO Europe.   Does climate change affect human health?   Climate change affects public health in many different ways. There are direct and indirect impacts, as well as those that occur immediately and those that occur over a longer period of time. We estimate that 150 000 deaths worldwide were caused by climate change in 2000. According to a new WHO study, this is projected to increase to 250 000 deaths per year worldwide by 2040. This estimate would have actually been higher if we had not factored in the reduction of child mortality expected in future years.   Extreme weather events are already among the top climate-change impacts that affect public health. In addition, mortality related to heatwaves and flooding is expected to increase, in particular in Europe. And changes in the distribution of vector-borne diseases will also affect human health.    How do extreme weather events affect public health?   Different types of extreme weather events affect different regions. Heatwaves are mostly a problem in southern Europe and the Mediterranean, but they are also a problem in other regions. According to estimates, the heatwave of 2003 caused 70 000 excess deaths in 12 European countries, mostly among older people. As people get older, the thermal regulation of the body is impaired, which makes older people more vulnerable to high temperatures.   By 2050, heatwaves are projected to cause 120 000 excess deaths per year in the European Union, and to have an economic cost of EUR 150 billion if no further measures are taken. This higher estimate is not only due to more frequent and higher temperatures but also due to Europe’s changing demographics. Currently, around 20% of EU citizens are over 65 years of age, and their share in the population is expected to increase to around 30% in 2050.   High temperatures are also often associated with air pollution, and ground-level ozone pollution in particular. Air pollution can cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems, especially among children and older people, and can result in premature deaths.   Other extreme weather events — such as high precipitation events that might cause floods — also affect public health.    How do floods affect our health?   To give a concrete example, the devastating floods in 2014 in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia caused 60 deaths and affected more than 2.5 million people. In addition to the immediate health impacts, rescue operations and public health services were also affected. Many hospitals, especially lower floors where heavy medical equipment is often kept, were flooded. This reduced the capacity of health services to cope with the disaster and to care for existing patients.   In the aftermath of such a disaster, displaced people who lost their homes are also likely to suffer from other long-term health problems, including stress.   There are also indirect health risks, largely due to deterioration or contamination of the environment. For example, floods can carry pollutants and chemicals from industrial facilities, waste water, and sewage water. This can lead to the contamination of drinking water and agricultural land. When there is no secure faecal and chemical disposal, floodwaters or greater run off can carry contaminants to lakes and the sea, and some might enter our food chain.    What other kinds of health risks are associated with climate change?   The health risks come from a variety of sources. Higher temperatures facilitate forest fires. Around 70 000 forest fires occur every year on the European continent. Although the large majority are man-made, high temperatures and droughts often worsen the overall damage. While some fires might result in loss of lives and property, they all cause air pollution, especially from particulate matter. This in turns triggers illness and premature death.   Higher temperatures, milder winters, and wetter summers are expanding the area where certain disease-carrying insects (such as ticks and mosquitoes) can survive and thrive. These insects can then carry diseases — such as Lyme disease, dengue, and malaria — to new areas where the climate was not suitable to the disease previously.   Climate change could also mean that some diseases might no longer be able to thrive in the areas they currently affect. For example, future warming could mean that ticks — and consequently tick-borne diseases — will be found at higher altitudes and further north, closely linked to the changing distribution of their natural hosts, such as deer.   Seasonal variations — some seasons starting earlier and lasting longer — might also have adverse impacts on human health. This could have a particular effect on people with allergies. We might also experience peaks in asthma cases, triggered by combined exposure to different allergens at the same time.   There are also other long-term health risks associated with climate change. Changes in temperature and precipitation are expected to affect food-production capacity in the wider pan-European region, with significant reductions expected in Central Asia. A further reduction of production capacity in the region could not only exacerbate the malnutrition problem, but also could have widespread impacts by raising food prices worldwide. Climate change is therefore a factor we have to take into account when we look at food security and access to affordable food. It can aggravate existing social and economic problems.    How can public authorities prepare for the health impacts of climate change?   Compared with many other regions, European health services are relatively better equipped to deal with the health impacts of climate change. Malaria, for example, is not likely to re-establish itself in the European Union. Nevertheless, single events such as floods or long-lasting heatwaves will continue to exert increasing pressure on the health services in affected areas. European countries will need to strengthen and adapt their health services to cope with the potential impacts of climate change in their area. Some measures could involve relocating and refitting hospitals to prepare against possible floods. Other measures could include better tools for sharing information with vulnerable groups to prevent their exposure to pollution.    WHO Europe has been working on the  health effects of climate change  for more than 20 years. We develop methods and tools, carry out impact assessments, and provide assistance to Member States to adapt to climate change. In  our recent report , we recommend adaptation measures, but we stress that adaptation measures will not be enough on their own.   It is quite clear that countries also need to undertake measures to mitigate climate change to protect public health. Some of these measures can have significant health co-benefits. For example, the promotion of so-called ‘active transport’ (such as cycling and walking) can contribute to reducing obesity and non-communicable diseases. And renewable energy such as solar energy can help to provide continuous energy to health services in remote areas.

"are-we-ready-for-climate-change  Are we ready for climate change?  Climate change is causing a variety of impacts to our health, ecosystems and economy. These impacts are likely to become more serious in the coming decades. If not addressed, these impacts could prove very costly, in terms of ill health, adverse effects on ecosystems, and damaged property and infrastructure. Many adaptation projects are already underway across Europe to prepare for a changing climate.    2014 will be remembered across Europe for its extreme weather events. In May 2014, a low-pressure cyclone hit south-eastern Europe, causing widespread flooding and 2 000 landslides across the Balkans. Then in early June 2014, a series of heavy rainstorms hit northern Europe. By July 2014, Europe was suffering from another problem: heat. Eastern Europe and the UK experienced a heatwave.    Extreme weather events as well as gradual changes in the climate — such as rising sea levels and warming oceans — will continue. In fact, these events are expected to become  more frequent and more intense  in the future. Even if all countries were to radically cut their emissions of greenhouse gases today, the greenhouse gases that have already been released into the atmosphere would continue to have a warming effect on the climate. In addition to substantially reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, countries in Europe and across the world need to put in place policies and measures to adapt to climate change.   Europe’s climate is changing   A changing climate will affect almost every aspect of our lives. Increased intensity and frequency of rainfall in many parts of Europe will mean frequent and serious flooding events, destroying homes and affecting other infrastructure (e.g. transport and energy) in risk areas. Elsewhere in Europe, including in southern Europe, higher temperatures and reduced rainfall will mean that many areas might face droughts. This could create competition between agriculture, industry, and households for scarce water resources. It could also create more heat-related health problems.   Climate change will also affect ecosystems across Europe. Many economic sectors depend on healthy and stable ecosystems to provide a variety of products and services to humans. For example, bees pollinate our crops, while forests help to absorb greenhouse gases. Changes to the balance of species and habitats in ecosystems could have wide-reaching effects. A reduction in rainfall in southern Europe could make it impossible to grow certain crops, while higher temperatures might allow alien invasive species and species that carry diseases to migrate northwards.   Warmer oceans are already forcing various fish species to move northward, which in turn puts further pressure on the fisheries sector. For example, the northward shift in mackerel stocks has exacerbated the already existing problem of overfishing of herring and mackerel in the Northeast Atlantic.   Climate change has a cost   Extreme weather events can result in loss of life, and bring economic and social activity in the affected area to a halt. Substantial funds are often required for rebuilding damaged property and infrastructure. However, most of the damage from extreme weather events in recent decades cannot be attributed to climate change alone. Socio-economic developments, and decisions such as expanding cities towards floodplains, are the main causes of the increased damage. But without adaptation actions, damage costs and other adverse effects are projected to increase as our climate continues to change.   The costs of future climate change are potentially very large. Recent  research  estimates that without adaptation actions, heat-related deaths could reach about 200 000 per year in Europe by 2100, and the cost of river flood damages could be more than EUR 10 billion a year. In the case of extensive climate change and no adaptation actions, forest fires could affect an area of roughly 800 000 hectares every year. The number of people affected by droughts could also increase by a factor of seven to about 150 million per year, and economic losses due to sea-level rise would more than triple to EUR 42 billion a year.   Although climate change is mostly expected to create costs for society, it may also create a limited number of new opportunities, which often come with new risks. Warmer winters in northern Europe might mean a reduced need for winter heating. On the other hand, warmer summers might increase the energy consumed for cooling. With sea ice melting, Arctic sea lanes might be opened to shipping and thus cut transport costs. But increased shipping might expose the Arctic to pollution and should be regulated to ensure that it is safe and clean.   Whatever the projected impacts are, be it more rain, higher temperatures, or less freshwater, European countries need to adapt their rural landscape, cities, and economy to a changing climate and reduce our vulnerability to climate change.   What is ‘climate change adaptation’?   ‘Adaptation’ covers a wide range of activities and policies that seek to prepare societies for a changing climate. When adaptation policies are implemented they can reduce the impacts and damage costs of climate change, and prepare societies to thrive and develop in a changed climate. Some of these actions have a relatively low cost, such as information campaigns on how to stay cool in warm weather or an early-warning system for heatwaves. Other adaptation actions can be very expensive, such as building dykes and coastal defences (such construction measures are often referred as ‘grey adaptation’), relocating houses out of flood-plains, or expanding retention basins to respond to droughts.   Some adaptation measures involve using natural methods to increase an area’s resilience to climate change. Such ‘green adaptation’ actions include restoring sand-dunes to prevent erosion or planting trees on river banks to reduce flooding. The city of  Nijmegen  in the Netherlands has implemented green adaptation measures of this sort. The Waal River bends and narrows around Nijmegen, causing floods in this coastal city. To prevent the damage from these floods, the city is building a canal, giving the river more room to flow. This also creates new spaces for recreation and for nature.     The Dutch Building with Nature programme is another good example of the combination of grey and green adaptation. It has promoted the restoration of coastal wetlands such as swamps, reedbeds, marshes, and mudflats. These wetland areas help to prevent soil subsidence thanks to the root structures of wetland plants. By preventing soil subsidence at coastal areas, this protects the surrounding area from flooding.   Other adaptation measures consist of using laws, taxes, financial incentives and information campaigns to enhance resilience to climate change (measures knowns as ‘soft adaptation’). An information campaign in  Zaragoza, Spain , made the city’s 700 000 inhabitants more aware of the need to use water sparingly to survive the lengthier droughts expected for this semi-arid region. Coupled with control of leakage from the water supply distribution network, the project has almost halved daily water use per person compared with 1980, and the city's total water consumption has fallen by 30% since 1995.   Adaptation in the European Union   The European Union and its Member States are already working on climate change adaptation. In 2013, the European Commission adopted the communication ‘An EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change’, which helps countries plan their adaptation activities. The Strategy also promotes the creation and sharing of knowledge, and aims to enhance resilience in key sectors by using EU funds. More than 20 European countries have already adopted adaptation strategies, outlining initial actions they will take (e.g. vulnerability assessments and research) and how they intend to adapt to a changing climate. However, in terms of concrete action on-the-ground, many countries are still at a very early stage.   An EEA survey of adaptation measures showed that water management is the sector that most countries are prioritising. However, countries also direct resources to providing information to their citizens. For example, as part of its efforts to reduce the spread of insect-borne diseases, the region of Emilia Romagna runs an awareness campaign on the dangers of Lyme disease, dengue, and West Nile disease.   Many countries have created  online adaptation-knowledge platforms  to facilitate the sharing of transnational, national, and local experiences and good practice. The  Climate-ADAPT  portal, managed by the European Environment Agency and the European Commission, provides a European platform for sharing such experiences.   Not adapting is not a viable option   Extreme weather events and EU policies have placed adaptation policies and measures higher on the political agenda in European countries in recent decades. However, according to  a recent survey , many countries are prevented from taking action by a lack of resources such as time, money, or technology. 'Uncertainties about the extent of future climate change' and 'unclear responsibilities' were also seen as barriers by a large number of countries.   The effects of climate change vary from region to region. Policymakers also face the difficulty of incorporating future changes in wealth, infrastructure, and population into their climate-change adaptation plans. What will an increasingly older and urbanised population need in terms of transport, housing, energy, health services, or simply food production, in a changing climate?   Rather than treating adaptation as a separate policy sphere, adaptation can best be implemented through better integration into every other area of public policy. Within their adaptation strategies, EU countries and the European Union are exploring how they can integrate adaptation concerns into different policy spheres such as agriculture, health, energy, or transport.   Extreme weather events in particular show that not adapting is a very costly decision and is not a viable option in the medium and long term. For example, transport infrastructure is often severely damaged in floods. When movement of people, goods, or services is hindered, the indirect costs to the economy can be many times higher than the direct cost of damaged transport infrastructure.   It is clear that, like many other infrastructure projects, adapting transport infrastructure is costly. It may also be difficult because the transport system involves different groups, from vehicle manufacturers to infrastructure managers to passengers. One cost-efficient solution is to consider adaptation measures when infrastructure is built or renewed, and the EU budget offers different funding opportunities to support infrastructure projects.   An effective solution requires a longer-term and wider perspective with the integration of climate change into different public policies around sustainability. In the case of climate change adaptation, this raises questions about how to build our cities, how to transport people and products, how to supply energy to our homes and factories, how to produce our food, and how to manage our natural environment.   It is also clear that an effective combination of adaptation and mitigation measures can help to ensure that future impacts of climate change are limited, and that when they do come, Europe is better prepared and more resilient.              climate change adaptation signals2015 climate change and health,2014 will be remembered across Europe for its extreme weather events. In May 2014, a low-pressure cyclone hit south-eastern Europe, causing widespread flooding and 2 000 landslides across the Balkans. Then in early June 2014, a series of heavy rainstorms hit northern Europe. By July 2014, Europe was suffering from another problem: heat. Eastern Europe and the UK experienced a heatwave. Extreme weather events as well as gradual changes in the climate — such as rising sea levels and warming oceans — will continue. In fact, these events are expected to become more frequent and more intense in the future. Even if all countries were to radically cut their emissions of greenhouse gases today, the greenhouse gases that have already been released into the atmosphere would continue to have a warming effect on the climate. In addition to substantially reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, countries in Europe and across the world need to put in place policies and measures to adapt to climate change. Europe’s climate is changing A changing climate will affect almost every aspect of our lives. Increased intensity and frequency of rainfall in many parts of Europe will mean frequent and serious flooding events, destroying homes and affecting other infrastructure (e.g. transport and energy) in risk areas. Elsewhere in Europe, including in southern Europe, higher temperatures and reduced rainfall will mean that many areas might face droughts. This could create competition between agriculture, industry, and households for scarce water resources. It could also create more heat-related health problems. Climate change will also affect ecosystems across Europe. Many economic sectors depend on healthy and stable ecosystems to provide a variety of products and services to humans. For example, bees pollinate our crops, while forests help to absorb greenhouse gases. Changes to the balance of species and habitats in ecosystems could have wide-reaching effects. A reduction in rainfall in southern Europe could make it impossible to grow certain crops, while higher temperatures might allow alien invasive species and species that carry diseases to migrate northwards. Warmer oceans are already forcing various fish species to move northward, which in turn puts further pressure on the fisheries sector. For example, the northward shift in mackerel stocks has exacerbated the already existing problem of overfishing of herring and mackerel in the Northeast Atlantic. Climate change has a cost Extreme weather events can result in loss of life, and bring economic and social activity in the affected area to a halt. Substantial funds are often required for rebuilding damaged property and infrastructure. However, most of the damage from extreme weather events in recent decades cannot be attributed to climate change alone. Socio-economic developments, and decisions such as expanding cities towards floodplains, are the main causes of the increased damage. But without adaptation actions, damage costs and other adverse effects are projected to increase as our climate continues to change. The costs of future climate change are potentially very large. Recent research estimates that without adaptation actions, heat-related deaths could reach about 200 000 per year in Europe by 2100, and the cost of river flood damages could be more than EUR 10 billion a year. In the case of extensive climate change and no adaptation actions, forest fires could affect an area of roughly 800 000 hectares every year. The number of people affected by droughts could also increase by a factor of seven to about 150 million per year, and economic losses due to sea-level rise would more than triple to EUR 42 billion a year.

"living-in-a-changing-climate  Living in a changing climate  Our climate is changing. Scientific evidence shows that the global average temperature is rising, and rainfall patterns are shifting. It also shows that glaciers, Arctic sea-ice and the Greenland ice sheet are melting. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report shows that the warming since the mid-20th century is predominantly due to an increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations as a result of emissions from human activities. Combustion of fossil fuels and changes in land use are largely responsible for this increase.    It is clear that we need to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions substantially in order to avoid the most adverse impacts of climate change. It is also clear that we need to adapt to our changing climate. Even with substantial reductions in our greenhouse-gas emissions, our climate is expected to change to some degree and the impacts of this will be felt across the world, including in Europe. Floods and droughts are expected to become more frequent and intense. Warmer temperatures, changes in precipitation levels and patterns, or extreme weather events are already impacting our health, natural environment, and economy.    Climate change affects us   We might not be aware of it but climate change affects us all: farmers, fishermen, asthma patients, the elderly, infants, urban residents, skiers, beachgoers… Extreme weather events, such as floods and storm surges, can devastate small communities — and even regions and countries. Heatwaves can exacerbate air pollution, aggravating cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and in some cases resulting in loss of life.   Warmer oceans risk unbalancing the entire food chain, and hence marine life, adding extra pressures to already overexploited fish stocks. Higher temperatures can also change the carbon storage capacity of the soil — the second largest carbon sink after the oceans. Droughts and warmer temperatures can impact agricultural production, driving up the competition between economic sectors for precious resources like water and land.   These impacts result in real losses. Recent research estimates that without adaptation actions heat-related deaths could reach about 200 000 per year in Europe by 2100. The cost of river flood damages could be more than EUR 10 billion a year. Other climate-change impacts include the damage from forest fires, reduced crop yields, or lost workdays due to respiratory diseases.   Faced with such current and future impacts, Europeans have no choice but to adapt to climate change. A European Union-level adaptation strategy is already in place to help countries plan their adaptation activities, and more than 20 European countries have adopted national adaptation strategies.   Some ongoing adaptation projects involve large projects to build new infrastructure (e.g. dykes and flood drains), whereas others propose restoring ecosystems to allow nature to tackle climate change impacts such as excess water or heat. Different initiatives and funding opportunities exist to help countries, cities, and regions prepare for climate change impacts and reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions.     Reducing emissions   The severity of climate change will depend on how much and how quickly we can cut greenhouse-gas emissions released into the atmosphere. Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our times. It is a global problem and concerns us all. The scientific community strongly recommends limiting the rise in global average temperatures and reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to avoid adverse impacts of climate change. Within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the international community has agreed to limit the global average temperature increase to 2°C above pre-industrial times.   If the global average temperature increases above 2°C, climate change will have much more severe impacts on our health, natural environment, and economy. An average 2°C increase means that temperatures will actually rise more than 2°C in certain parts of the world, especially in the Arctic, where greater impacts will threaten unique natural systems.   The European Union has set ambitious long-term goals on climate-change mitigation. In 2013, the EU had already reduced its domestic greenhouse-gas emissions by 19% compared to 1990 levels. The target of a 20% reduction by 2020 is within reach.   Achieving a reduction of at least 40% in domestic emissions (i.e. emitted in the EU) by 2030 and an 80-95% reduction by 2050 will partly depend on the EU’s ability to channel sufficient amounts of public and private funds towards sustainable and innovative technologies. Effective carbon prices and regulations are instrumental in steering investments towards climate-friendly innovations, in renewable energy and energy efficiency in particular. In some cases, funding decisions might also entail divesting away from some sectors and restructuring others.   Emission reductions by EU Member States would address the problem only partly, because the EU currently emits only around 10% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. It is clear that achieving the 2°C target requires a global effort with substantial cuts to global greenhouse-gas emissions. The scientific community estimates that to achieve the 2°C target only a limited amount of carbon can be released into the atmosphere before the end of the century. The world has already released the large majority of this ‘carbon budget’. At current rates, the entire carbon budget will be exhausted well before 2100.   To increase our chances of limiting the average temperature increase to 2°C, scientific studies show that global emissions have to peak in 2020, and then start declining. In this context, the upcoming climate talks (COP21) in Paris need to become a turning point for a global agreement on cutting greenhouse-gas emissions and providing support to developing countries.   A low-carbon future by 2050 is possible   At the heart of the problem lie unsustainable consumption and production patterns. Building on recent trends observed in Europe’s environment and on global megatrends, our recent report ‘The European environment — state and outlook 2015’ calls for a transition to a green economy. The green economy is a sustainable way of life that allows us to live well, and within the limits of our planet. This transition involves structural changes to key systems, such as energy and transport, which require long-term investments in our infrastructure.   Europeans are already investing in these key systems. The challenge is to make sure that all current and future investments put us one step closer to greening our economy, and do not lock us into an unsustainable path of development. Making the right investments today will not only minimise the overall costs of climate change, but it can strengthen Europe’s expertise in the thriving eco-industries — the economy of the future. At the end of the day, we all have a stake in defining what life with climate change will look like.   The challenge we are facing might seem daunting. But no matter how big the challenge may be, the 2°C target is still within our reach. We now need to be courageous and ambitious enough to grasp it.

"climate-change-and-the-seas  Climate change and the seas  Climate change is warming the oceans, causing acidification of marine environments, and changing rainfall patterns. This combination of factors often exacerbates the impacts of other human pressures on the seas, leading to loss of marine biodiversity. Many human livelihoods depend on marine biodiversity and ecosystems, so action to limit ocean warming must be taken quickly.    Changes in the marine food-web   The oceans absorb heat from the atmosphere. Measurements now show that the warming of the oceans has affected areas far below the ocean surface in recent decades. The effect on marine life of warming oceans is strong, and biodiversity is at ever greater risk. Nowhere is this more clearly highlighted than in the case of warmer-water plankton in the Northeast Atlantic. Some copepod are moving northwards at a rate of 200-250 km per decade. These small copepods are near the bottom of the food chain. Fish and other animals of the Northeast Atlantic feed on these copepods and their  distribution pattern in the oceans may change as a result of the copepods’ northward movement .   Animals living outside their optimal temperature range expend more energy on respiration to the detriment of their other functions. This weakens them, making them more vulnerable to disease, and allowing other species that are better suited to the new temperature regime to get a competitive advantage. In addition, the spores, eggs, or offspring of these animals will struggle to develop in suboptimal temperatures. As some species suffer in the new conditions, this can have spillover effects on the other organisms that depend on or interact with them. This chain of events ultimately influences the overall functioning of the ecosystem, which can lead to loss of biodiversity. This is exactly what is happening with copepods: because they are eaten by so many other organisms their suffering influences the entire food web.   Higher up in the food chain, animals that cannot find food are forced to move in order to survive. In Europe, where  sea surface temperature is increasing more rapidly  than in the global oceans,  they move predominantly northwards . This phenomenon can affect fish stocks, as illustrated by the way mackerel have started to spend more time in more northern waters. This can have a knock-on effect on local fishermen and communities further afield. One of the knock-on effects was the infamous ‘mackerel war’ between the EU and the Faroe Islands. The ‘mackerel war’ arose partly because of  overfishing of blue whiting and partly as a direct result of fish species, including herring and mackerel, moving further north in response to rising sea temperatures. The extra time spent by the fish stocks in Faroese waters resulted in a disagreement on fishing rights. From a Faroese perspective, they had a right to the fish in their waters, but from an EU perspective, agreements on sustainable fishing quotas were being breached, potentially  leading to the risk of overfishing with the loss of EU income and jobs as a consequence . The dispute came to an end in 2014, when the EU lifted import bans on the fish caught in Faroese waters in return for an end to fishing carried out by the islanders.   Acidification   In addition to absorbing heat, the oceans are also a carbon-dioxide sink. The more CO 2  enters the atmosphere, the more is absorbed into the oceans, where it reacts with water to produce carbonic acid, resulting in acidification. The  oceans have absorbed more than a quarter of the carbon dioxide  released into the atmosphere since 1750 through human activities.   Ocean acidification has historically been associated with each of the five major extinction events that have occurred on Earth.  Today acidification is happening 100 times faster  than any other period in the last 55 million years and species may not be able to adapt quickly enough.   Acidification affects marine life in different ways. For example, corals, mussels, oysters and other marine organisms that build shells of calcium carbonate have a more difficult time constructing their shells or skeletal material as sea water pH decreases. Thus, anthropogenic reductions in sea water pH could affect entire marine ecosystems.   Dead zones   A rise in ocean temperature also speeds up the metabolism of organisms and their oxygen intake, which in turn reduces oxygen concentrations in water. This can ultimately make parts of the ocean uninhabitable for sea life.   Oxygen in the sea can also be depleted as a result of nutrients entering the water. For example, rainfall brings nutrients from agricultural fertilisers to the sea. This enrichment with nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates may occur naturally, but about 80% of all nutrients in the sea come from land-based activities, including sewage, industrial waste, municipal waste, and agricultural run-off.  The rest mainly comes from nitrous gases  emitted when burning fossil fuels from traffic, industry, power generation, and heating.  In the parts of Europe where increased rainfall and temperature are brought about by climate change, the effects of nutrient enrichment are exacerbated.   Enrichment of water with nutrients drives a process known as ‘eutrophication’, which leads to excessive plant growth. When this happens in the sea, it creates what is known as an algal bloom. Through excess respiration and the eventual death and decay of these aquatic plants, oxygen is removed from the water. This results in an oxygen deficit and ultimately leads to hypoxic areas or ‘dead zones’ where aerobic life can no longer survive.   Such dead zones can be observed in Europe’s partially enclosed seas, such as the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. Water temperature in the Baltic Sea has increased by about 2°C over the last century, which has contributed to the increase in the extent of dead zones. Moreover, the global occurrence of  dead zones  has doubled in frequency every decade since the mid-1900s. And unfortunately, even if the nutrient emissions to European seas were to be halted today, the legacy of past nutrient emissions would continue to cause dead zones for decades to come before the seas were returned to their former state.   Uncertain future   Although certain models look at possible climate change scenarios, it is difficult to predict how marine species will behave as the stresses on the oceans are magnified. But we do know that we must take action to mitigate climate change now in order to limit further ocean warming and ocean acidification, and the effects that both of these have on the environment and our well-being.         climate change consequences marine ecosystems signals2015 climate change mitigation,Changes in the marine food-web The oceans absorb heat from the atmosphere. Measurements now show that the warming of the oceans has affected areas far below the ocean surface in recent decades. The effect on marine life of warming oceans is strong, and biodiversity is at ever greater risk. Nowhere is this more clearly highlighted than in the case of warmer-water plankton in the Northeast Atlantic. Some copepod are moving northwards at a rate of 200-250 km per decade. These small copepods are near the bottom of the food chain. Fish and other animals of the Northeast Atlantic feed on these copepods and their distribution pattern in the oceans may change as a result of the copepods’ northward movement. Animals living outside their optimal temperature range expend more energy on respiration to the detriment of their other functions. This weakens them, making them more vulnerable to disease, and allowing other species that are better suited to the new temperature regime to get a competitive advantage. In addition, the spores, eggs, or offspring of these animals will struggle to develop in suboptimal temperatures. As some species suffer in the new conditions, this can have spillover effects on the other organisms that depend on or interact with them. This chain of events ultimately influences the overall functioning of the ecosystem, which can lead to loss of biodiversity. This is exactly what is happening with copepods: because they are eaten by so many other organisms their suffering influences the entire food web. Higher up in the food chain, animals that cannot find food are forced to move in order to survive. In Europe, where sea surface temperature is increasing more rapidly than in the global oceans, they move predominantly northwards. This phenomenon can affect fish stocks, as illustrated by the way mackerel have started to spend more time in more northern waters. This can have a knock-on effect on local fishermen and communities further afield. One of the knock-on effects was the infamous ‘mackerel war’ between the EU and the Faroe Islands. The ‘mackerel war’ arose partly because of  overfishing of blue whiting and partly as a direct result of fish species, including herring and mackerel, moving further north in response to rising sea temperatures. The extra time spent by the fish stocks in Faroese waters resulted in a disagreement on fishing rights. From a Faroese perspective, they had a right to the fish in their waters, but from an EU perspective, agreements on sustainable fishing quotas were being breached, potentially leading to the risk of overfishing with the loss of EU income and jobs as a consequence. The dispute came to an end in 2014, when the EU lifted import bans on the fish caught in Faroese waters in return for an end to fishing carried out by the islanders. Acidification In addition to absorbing heat, the oceans are also a carbon-dioxide sink. The more CO2 enters the atmosphere, the more is absorbed into the oceans, where it reacts with water to produce carbonic acid, resulting in acidification. The oceans have absorbed more than a quarter of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere since 1750 through human activities. Ocean acidification has historically been associated with each of the five major extinction events that have occurred on Earth. Today acidification is happening 100 times faster than any other period in the last 55 million years and species may not be able to adapt quickly enough. Acidification affects marine life in different ways. For example, corals, mussels, oysters and other marine organisms that build shells of calcium carbonate have a more difficult time constructing their shells or skeletal material as sea water pH decreases. Thus, anthropogenic reductions in sea water pH could affect entire marine ecosystems. Dead zones A rise in ocean temperature also speeds up the metabolism of organisms and their oxygen intake, which in turn reduces oxygen concentrations in water. This can ultimately make parts of the ocean uninhabitable for sea life. Oxygen in the sea can also be depleted as a result of nutrients entering the water. For example, rainfall brings nutrients from agricultural fertilisers to the sea. This enrichment with nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates may occur naturally, but about 80% of all nutrients in the sea come from land-based activities, including sewage, industrial waste, municipal waste, and agricultural run-off. The rest mainly comes from nitrous gases emitted when burning fossil fuels from traffic, industry, power generation, and heating.  In the parts of Europe where increased rainfall and temperature are brought about by climate change, the effects of nutrient enrichment are exacerbated. Enrichment of water with nutrients drives a process known as ‘eutrophication’, which leads to excessive plant growth. When this happens in the sea, it creates what is known as an algal bloom. Through excess respiration and the eventual death and decay of these aquatic plants, oxygen is removed from the water. This results in an oxygen deficit and ultimately leads to hypoxic areas or ‘dead zones’ where aerobic life can no longer survive. Such dead zones can be observed in Europe’s partially enclosed seas, such as the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. Water temperature in the Baltic Sea has increased by about 2°C over the last century, which has contributed to the increase in the extent of dead zones. Moreover, the global occurrence of dead zones has doubled in frequency every decade since the mid-1900s. And unfortunately, even if the nutrient emissions to European seas were to be halted today, the legacy of past nutrient emissions would continue to cause dead zones for decades to come before the seas were returned to their former state. Uncertain future Although certain models look at possible climate change scenarios, it is difficult to predict how marine species will behave as the stresses on the oceans are magnified. But we do know that we must take action to mitigate climate change now in order to limit further ocean warming and ocean acidification, and the effects that both of these have on the environment and our well-being.

"climate-change-and-investments  Climate change and investments  Measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change are often considered to be expensive, and are seen as an additional burden on the economy. But European countries are already spending public and private funds on research, infrastructure, agriculture, energy, transport, urban development, social protection, health, and nature conservation. We can ensure that our existing expenditure on these areas favours climate-friendly and sustainable options that will help to create new jobs.   Climate change will affect us in a variety of ways, whether through increased air pollution, acidification of oceans, or flooded homes and fields. Some damage costs, such as economic loss due to damaged property from floods, are relatively easy to quantify in monetary terms. But other costs are more difficult to estimate. Can we put an accurate price tag on potential ill health or future reductions in crop productivity due to climate change?    Despite such difficulties and the uncertainties linked to climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates the likely economic loss caused by just 2°C of global warming to be between 0.2-2% of global gross domestic product (GDP), even if strong adaptation measures are taken.   Once warming proceeds beyond this, the costs would rise further  .    Although we may not know the exact amount, costs from climate change are real and we are already paying for them in many ways, such as damaged property, medical expenses, and reduced crop yields.   In order to prevent or minimise some of the future costs to our society, economy, and environment, we need to take action. This raises the following questions: how much do we need to invest and in what areas?   Investing in infrastructure   Worldwide, we are consuming increasingly more resources. We need more food, land, and water to feed a growing global population, and we need more energy to heat homes and to fuel our cars. Our increasing levels of consumption are being met by unsustainable production patterns, which deplete non-renewable resources. This also results in more pollutants being released to the atmosphere, water bodies, and land.   The efforts to tackle climate change should be seen in the context of a broader transition to a ‘green economy’ — a sustainable way of life that allows us to live well, while keeping our resource use within the sustainable limits of our planet. The European Union’s 7 th  Environment Action Programme identifies ‘investments’ as one of the key pillars enabling this transition.   Investments are critical in tackling climate change because the investment choices made today have long-term implications — both positive and negative — for how basic societal needs are met in the future. One of the key ways that investments can help to tackle climate change is through infrastructure. Our societies build infrastructure to meet basic societal needs such as water, energy and mobility. This infrastructure is often very costly and is used for decades. It is therefore crucial in shaping the way we live. Some investment decisions might provide real opportunities to transform the way we meet these needs, while others risk locking us into unsustainable practices for decades.   The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has estimated that  the world spends approximately EUR 4.8 trillion (USD 5.3 trillion) a year on energy subsidies , mainly on fossil fuels.  The IMF’s definition of ‘subsidies’ in the context of its recent report covers the unpaid costs of all the environmental damage caused by fossil fuels. In the same report, the IMF estimates direct subsidies (i.e. government policies underwriting oil, gas, and coal production or consumption) to amount to approximately EUR 460 billion globally (USD 500 billion). Such subsidies might result in unintended outcomes, where long-term investment decisions concerning our energy infrastructure continue to favour fossil fuels.    Decarbonising the energy and transport systems?   Combustion of fossil fuels is one of the key contributors to greenhouse-gas emissions released into the atmosphere. Fossil fuels are also one of the key components of the global energy system, meeting our need for energy in our homes, offices, factories, and cars.   A total shift from fossil fuels to sustainable renewable alternatives is not easy. It requires changes in the entire energy system from production and storage to distribution and final consumption. For example, the electricity produced by solar panels should be made available for use at a later date in another location, and possibly another country. This can only be achieved if well-connected smart grids are in place. Other systems such as the transport system will also need radical change. This will involve replacing the current fleet with electric vehicles, and creating new public transport networks that can address the demand for mobility by offering alternatives to driving in private cars. When taken altogether, the investment needs to bring about these changes could be massive.   According to  European Commission estimates ,  making the EU’s energy and transport systems ‘low carbon’ will require around EUR 270 billion of additional public and private investment per year for the next 40 years. This additional amount corresponds to around 1.5% of EU GDP — similar to the IPCC’s climate change economic loss estimate of 0.2-2% of global GDP by 2050. So will investors act now to minimise future impacts?    Re-directing existing expenditure   Governments, businesses, and citizens are already spending money on building transport networks, power generation, housing, and consumption goods and services in the EU. Although it varies among the Member States, government spending in the EU is close to  around 50% of GDP .  A part of this consists of investment expenditure (technically ‘gross capital formation’) on areas such as large infrastructure projects, research, health services, etc. The same is true for household or business expenditure.    So what kind of energy and mobility system we are going to build for the future? Are we going to lock our money into unsustainable solutions or are we going to create the space in which sustainable alternatives can grow and transform the way we meet our needs? Public funding can play an instrumental role here by providing incentives and sending ‘green’ signals to the market. For example, the decision to shift public funds from fossil fuels towards renewable energy generation would send a clear signal not only to energy producers, but also to researchers and energy users.   In line with its Europe 2020 Strategy, the EU allocates nearly EUR 1 trillion for sustainable growth, jobs, and competitiveness in its multiannual budget for 2014-2020. At least 20% of this multiannual budget will be spent on transforming Europe into a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy.  To achieve this goal,   climate objectives have been included in relevant EU policies and programmes   such as structural funds, research, agriculture, maritime policy, fisheries, and the LIFE programme on nature conservation and climate action.    These funds are complemented by public expenditure at national, regional, and local levels in the EU Member States, as well as by private sector investments (e.g. businesses, pension schemes, households). There are also global funding channels, such as the  Green Climate Fund  set up under the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), aimed at helping developing countries to adapt to climate change impacts and to adopt mitigation measures.   The opportunity ahead   We know that we need to invest to meet growing demand in some areas. According to the  New Climate Economy report ,  global energy use is projected to grow by between 20% and 35% in the next 15 years. To meet this demand, more than EUR 41 trillion will be required between 2015 and 2030 for key categories of energy infrastructure. Given that energy production and use already account for two-thirds of global greenhouse-gas emissions, the type of energy sources we invest today will largely determine whether we will succeed in limiting global warming to 2°C or not.    Some sectors and communities will undoubtedly be affected by this shift and re-channelling of funds towards sustainable alternatives. Governments will need to use social policies to support those affected by this transition. Governments and public authorities will also need to adjust to changing realities. For example, a total divestment from fossil fuels would also imply reduced tax revenues and royalties from these sectors. It would also imply downsizing in the affected sectors and likely job losses.   In some ways, change is already underway. Despite the economic crisis that affected the European economy from 2008 onwards, eco-industries (e.g. renewable energy, wastewater treatment, and recycling) in the European Union continue to grow. Between 2000 and 2012, eco-industries grew by more than 50% in terms of value added and by almost 1.4 million additional jobs to reach a workforce of 4.3 million, while the rest of the economy showed otherwise relatively flat growth and stagnant employment rates in this period. This boom in eco-industry jobs could equally be seen as part of an evolving and competitive workforce, with fewer people working in unsustainable sectors (e.g. coal extraction).   With higher awareness levels, some communities and businesses are also deliberately divesting or opting out of unsustainable solutions in favour of supporting niche innovations. Investing in environmental innovation and research would not only help the EU to adopt cleaner technologies and build a sustainable future, it would also boost the EU’s economy and competitiveness. Europe can reap the benefits of being a global leader in eco-industries by exporting its technology and know-how to help meet the anticipated growth in global demand in energy, mobility, and housing.   It is true that a transition to a green economy will take time. But the earlier we act, the lower will be the costs and the greater will be the benefits.              climate change consequences climate change mitigation financial investments signals2015 green economy,Climate change will affect us in a variety of ways, whether through increased air pollution, acidification of oceans, or flooded homes and fields.

"agriculture-and-climate-change  Agriculture and climate change  Agriculture both contributes to climate change and is affected by climate change. The EU needs to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions from agriculture and adapt its food-production system to cope with climate change. But climate change is only one of many pressures on agriculture. Faced with growing global demand and competition for resources, the EU’s food production and consumption need to be seen in a broader context, linking agriculture, energy, and food security.   Food is a basic human need, and a healthy diet is a key component of our health and wellbeing. A complex and increasingly globalised system of production and delivery has developed over time to meet our need for food and for different flavours. In today’s world, a fish caught in the Atlantic might be served within days in a restaurant in Prague alongside rice imported from India. Similarly, European food products are sold and consumed in the rest of the world.     Agriculture contributes to climate change   Before reaching our plates, our food is produced, stored, processed, packaged, transported, prepared, and served. At every stage, food provisioning releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Farming in particular releases significant amounts of methane and nitrous oxide, two powerful greenhouse gases. Methane is produced by livestock during digestion due to enteric fermentation and is released via belches. It can also escape from stored manure and organic waste in landfills. Nitrous oxide emissions are an indirect product of organic and mineral nitrogen fertilisers.   Agriculture accounted for 10% of the EU’s total greenhouse-gas emissions in 2012. A significant decline in livestock numbers, more efficient application of fertilisers, and better manure management reduced the EU’s emissions from agriculture by 24% between 1990 and 2012.   However, agriculture in the rest of the world is moving in the opposite direction. Between 2001 and 2011, global emissions from crop and livestock production grew by 14%. The increase occurred mainly in developing countries, due to a rise in total agricultural output. This was driven by increased global food demand and changes in food-consumption patterns due to rising incomes in some developing countries. Emissions from enteric fermentation increased 11% in this period and accounted for 39% of the sector's total greenhouse-gas outputs in 2011.   Given the central importance of food in our lives, a further reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions from agriculture remains quite challenging. Nevertheless, there is still potential to further reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions linked to food production in the EU. A better integration of innovative techniques into production methods, such as capturing methane from manure, more efficient use of fertilisers, and greater efficiency in meat and dairy production (i.e. reducing emissions per unit of food produced) can help.   In addition to such efficiency gains, changes on the consumption side can help to further lower greenhouse-gas emissions linked to food. In general, meat and dairy products have the highest global footprint of carbon, raw materials, and water per kilogramme of any food. In terms of greenhouse-gas emissions, livestock and fodder production each generate more than 3 billion tonnes of CO 2  equivalent. Post-farm transport and processing account for only a tiny fraction of the emissions linked to food. By reducing food waste and our consumption of emission-intensive food products, we can contribute to cutting the greenhouse-gas emissions of agriculture.   Climate change affects agriculture   Crops need suitable soil, water, sunlight, and heat to grow. Warmer air temperatures have already affected the length of the growing season over large parts of Europe. Flowering and harvest dates for cereal crops are now happening several days earlier in the season. These changes are expected to continue in many regions.   In general, in northern Europe agricultural productivity might increase due to a longer growing season and an extension of the frost-free period. Warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons might also allow new crops to be cultivated. In southern Europe, however, extreme heat events and reductions in precipitation and water availability are expected to hamper crop productivity. Crop yields are also expected to vary increasingly from year to year due to extreme weather events and other factors such as pests and diseases.   In parts of the Mediterranean area, due to extreme heat and water stress in summer months, some summer crops might be cultivated in winter instead. Other areas, such as western France and south-eastern Europe, are expected to face yield reductions due to hot and dry summers without the possibility of shifting crop production into winter.   Changes in temperatures and growing seasons might also affect the proliferation and the spreading of some species, such as insects, invasive weeds, or diseases, all of which might in turn affect crop yields. A part of the potential yield losses can be offset by farming practices, such as rotating crops to match water availability, adjusting sowing dates to temperature and rainfall patterns, and using crop varieties better suited to new conditions (e.g. heat- and drought-resilient crops).   Land-based food sources are not the only food sources affected by climate change. The distribution of some fish stocks has already changed in the Northeast Atlantic, affecting the communities relying on these stocks throughout the supply chain. Along with increased maritime shipping, warmer water temperatures can also help facilitate the establishment of invasive marine species, causing local fish stocks to collapse.   Some  EU funds , including the  European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development , Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and loans from the European Investment Bank, are available to help farmers and fishing communities to adapt to climate change. There are also other funds under the CAP aimed at helping to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from agricultural activities.   Global market, global demand, global warming…   In line with projected population growth and changes in dietary habits in favour of higher meat consumption, the global demand for food is expected to grow by up to 70% in the coming decades. Agriculture is already one of the economic sectors with the largest environmental impact. This substantial increase in demand will unsurprisingly create additional pressures. How can we meet this increasing global demand while at the same time reducing the impacts of European food production and consumption on the environment?   Reducing the amount of food produced is not a viable solution. The  EU is one of the world’s largest food producers , producing around one eighth of the global cereal output, two thirds of the world’s wine, half of its sugar beet, and three quarters of its olive oil. Any reduction in key staples is likely to jeopardise food security in the EU and in the world, and increase global food prices. This would make it harder for many groups around the world to access affordable and nutritious food.    Producing more food out of the land that is already used for agriculture often requires heavier use of nitrogen-based fertilisers, which in turn release nitrous oxide emissions and contribute to climate change. Intensive agriculture and fertiliser use also release nitrates to the soil and to water bodies. Although not directly linked to climate change, high concentrations of nutrients (especially phosphates and nitrates) in water bodies cause eutrophication. Eutrophication promotes algae growth and depletes oxygen in the water, which in turn has severe impacts on aquatic life and water quality.   Whether in Europe or the rest of the world, meeting the growing demand for food by using more land would have serious impacts on the environment and the climate. The areas most suitable to agriculture in Europe are already cultivated to a large extent. Land, especially fertile agricultural land, is a limited resource in Europe and across the world.   Converting forest areas into agricultural land is also not a solution as this process is a source of greenhouse-gas emissions. Similar to many other land-use changes, deforestation (currently occurring mainly outside the European Union) also puts biodiversity at risk, further undermining nature’s ability to cope with climate change impacts (such as absorbing heavy rainfall).   Competing demands   It is clear that the world will need to produce more food and that key resources are limited. Agriculture has high impacts on the environment and the climate. Moreover, climate change affects — and will continue to affect — how much food can be produced and where.   Who gets to produce what and where is a socio-political question and is likely to become more controversial in the future. The global competition for these essential resources, especially with the pending impacts of climate change, is driving developed countries to purchase large patches of agricultural land in less-developed countries. Such land purchases and climate change impacts raise questions about food security in developing countries in particular. Food security is not only a matter of producing sufficient quantities of food, but also of having access to food of sufficient nutritional value.   This complex problem requires a coherent and integrated policy approach to climate change, energy, and food security. Faced with climate change and competition for scarce resources, the entire food system will need to transform itself and be much more resource efficient while continuously reducing its environmental impacts, including its greenhouse-gas emissions. We need to increase yields while reducing our dependence on agrochemicals, to reduce food waste, and to reduce our consumption of resource-intensive and greenhouse gas-intensive foods such as meat.   In doing this, we must also remember that farmers can play a key role in maintaining and managing Europe’s biodiversity. They are also a critical component of the rural economy. Therefore, policy measures to tackle this highly complex problem of food and the environment should take into consideration agriculture’s impacts on the environment and its socio-economic importance for many communities.         climate change consequences climate change mitigation climate change adaptation signals2015 agricultural ecosystems,Food is a basic human need, and a healthy diet is a key component of our health and wellbeing.

Nevertheless, there is still potential to further reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions linked to food production in the EU. A better integration of innovative techniques into production methods, such as capturing methane from manure, more efficient use of fertilisers, and greater efficiency in meat and dairy production (i.e. reducing emissions per unit of food produced) can help. In addition to such efficiency gains, changes on the consumption side can help to further lower greenhouse-gas emissions linked to food. In general, meat and dairy products have the highest global footprint of carbon, raw materials, and water per kilogramme of any food. In terms of greenhouse-gas emissions, livestock and fodder production each generate more than 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent. Post-farm transport and processing account for only a tiny fraction of the emissions linked to food. By reducing food waste and our consumption of emission-intensive food products, we can contribute to cutting the greenhouse-gas emissions of agriculture. Climate change affects agriculture Crops need suitable soil, water, sunlight, and heat to grow. Warmer air temperatures have already affected the length of the growing season over large parts of Europe. Flowering and harvest dates for cereal crops are now happening several days earlier in the season. These changes are expected to continue in many regions. In general, in northern Europe agricultural productivity might increase due to a longer growing season and an extension of the frost-free period. Warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons might also allow new crops to be cultivated. In southern Europe, however, extreme heat events and reductions in precipitation and water availability are expected to hamper crop productivity. Crop yields are also expected to vary increasingly from year to year due to extreme weather events and other factors such as pests and diseases. In parts of the Mediterranean area, due to extreme heat and water stress in summer months, some summer crops might be cultivated in winter instead. Other areas, such as western France and south-eastern Europe, are expected to face yield reductions due to hot and dry summers without the possibility of shifting crop production into winter. Changes in temperatures and growing seasons might also affect the proliferation and the spreading of some species, such as insects, invasive weeds, or diseases, all of which might in turn affect crop yields. A part of the potential yield losses can be offset by farming practices, such as rotating crops to match water availability, adjusting sowing dates to temperature and rainfall patterns, and using crop varieties better suited to new conditions (e.g. heat- and drought-resilient crops). Land-based food sources are not the only food sources affected by climate change. The distribution of some fish stocks has already changed in the Northeast Atlantic, affecting the communities relying on these stocks throughout the supply chain. Along with increased maritime shipping, warmer water temperatures can also help facilitate the establishment of invasive marine species, causing local fish stocks to collapse. Some EU funds, including the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and loans from the European Investment Bank, are available to help farmers and fishing communities to adapt to climate change. There are also other funds under the CAP aimed at helping to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from agricultural activities. Global market, global demand, global warming… In line with projected population growth and changes in dietary habits in favour of higher meat consumption, the global demand for food is expected to grow by up to 70% in the coming decades. Agriculture is already one of the economic sectors with the largest environmental impact. This substantial increase in demand will unsurprisingly create additional pressures. How can we meet this increasing global demand while at the same time reducing the impacts of European food production and consumption on the environment? Reducing the amount of food produced is not a viable solution. The EU is one of the world’s largest food producers, producing around one eighth of the global cereal output, two thirds of the world’s wine, half of its sugar beet, and three quarters of its olive oil. Any reduction in key staples is likely to jeopardise food security in the EU and in the world, and increase global food prices. This would make it harder for many groups around the world to access affordable and nutritious food.  Producing more food out of the land that is already used for agriculture often requires heavier use of nitrogen-based fertilisers, which in turn release nitrous oxide emissions and contribute to climate change. Intensive agriculture and fertiliser use also release nitrates to the soil and to water bodies. Although not directly linked to climate change, high concentrations of nutrients (especially phosphates and nitrates) in water bodies cause eutrophication. Eutrophication promotes algae growth and depletes oxygen in the water, which in turn has severe impacts on aquatic life and water quality. Whether in Europe or the rest of the world, meeting the growing demand for food by using more land would have serious impacts on the environment and the climate. The areas most suitable to agriculture in Europe are already cultivated to a large extent. Land, especially fertile agricultural land, is a limited resource in Europe and across the world. Converting forest areas into agricultural land is also not a solution as this process is a source of greenhouse-gas emissions. Similar to many other land-use changes, deforestation (currently occurring mainly outside the European Union) also puts biodiversity at risk, further undermining nature’s ability to cope with climate change impacts (such as absorbing heavy rainfall). Competing demands It is clear that the world will need to produce more food and that key resources are limited. Agriculture has high impacts on the environment and the climate. Moreover, climate change affects — and will continue to affect — how much food can be produced and where. Who gets to produce what and where is a socio-political question and is likely to become more controversial in the future. The global competition for these essential resources, especially with the pending impacts of climate change, is driving developed countries to purchase large patches of agricultural land in less-developed countries. Such land purchases and climate change impacts raise questions about food security in developing countries in particular. Food security is not only a matter of producing sufficient quantities of food, but also of having access to food of sufficient nutritional value. This complex problem requires a coherent and integrated policy approach to climate change, energy, and food security. Faced with climate change and competition for scarce resources, the entire food system will need to transform itself and be much more resource efficient while continuously reducing its environmental impacts, including its greenhouse-gas emissions. We need to increase yields while reducing our dependence on agrochemicals, to reduce food waste, and to reduce our consumption of resource-intensive and greenhouse gas-intensive foods such as meat. In doing this, we must also remember that farmers can play a key role in maintaining and managing Europe’s biodiversity. They are also a critical component of the rural economy. Therefore, policy measures to tackle this highly complex problem of food and the environment should take into consideration agriculture’s impacts on the environment and its socio-economic importance for many communities.

"climate-change-and-cities  Climate change and cities  Most Europeans now live in cities, so the choices we make about urban infrastructure will have a large influence on how well we cope with climate change. More frequent rainfall, flooding, and heatwaves are likely to be among the challenges that Europes cities will face from climate change. We asked Holger Robrecht, Deputy Regional Director of ICLEI, what cities are doing to adapt to climate change.   What effects will climate change have on cities?   Climate change will have a variety of effects on cities. The most likely effects in Europe are an increase in extreme weather events like flooding, storms, and heatwaves. This could have a serious effect on urban infrastructure such as transport systems, sewage systems, and even food-delivery systems. In heavy rainfalls and floods, the danger is that our drainage and sewage systems cannot cope. We have seen an example of this during the rain storm in 2011 in Copenhagen, which showed the disruption that can happen in heavy rainfalls. This storm led to flooding in houses, and it also damaged railways, roads, and the metro system. Heavy rainfalls can also cause landslides in mountains and hills outside cities. These landslides can cut off roads, making it difficult to deliver food and other goods. We have already seen this happen in the Philippines and in Italy, in the Liguria region around Genoa.   Climate change places pressure on our hard infrastructure such as roads, houses, and sewage systems. But it also places pressure on our soft infrastructure such as our health systems. This is very evident in events such as heatwaves, which are another problem for urban areas. Cities create heat islands that are far warmer than rural areas. Old people are especially at risk of mortality in urban areas. This creates a new type of challenge for our health systems.   How are cities adapting to the challenge of climate change?   Many cities in Europe have very forward-thinking adaptation plans, including London, Copenhagen, Bratislava, and Almada in Portugal. If I could highlight just three, they would be Rotterdam, Ghent, and Bologna. In the case of Rotterdam and Ghent, these cities partnered with research organisations to assess the places in the cities that would be the hottest during heatwaves. They decided to place thermometers in a variety of locations, and even placed mobile thermometers on trams. In this way, they could detect the places in the cities where the heat-island effect was greatest. As a result, they were able to take remedial actions, such as planting trees, to reduce the effects of some of these heat islands.   Bologna adopted a very different approach. Bologna is an old medieval city at risk of flooding by the Po river. However, it is also affected by heavy rainfall and by heatwaves, so they face a triple challenge. The city government of Bologna developed a mobile phone app, through which citizens detect and report any kind of damage in the city that came from any event such as heavy rainfall or heatwave. The app also allows citizens to make suggestions to the city government on how to prepare for any future event that might happen. The app was part of Bolognas Blue AP adaptation plan and received funding from the EU.   Is adapting to climate change on the political agenda in Europe?   Yes. In recent years, climate change adaption has grown greatly in importance. This is because so many areas in Europe have been affected by extreme events from climate change in the past decade. And the effects of these extreme weather events have often been far worse than anybody would have predicted ten years ago. For example, in 2010 Cyclone Xynthia flooded many areas in coastal France and left almost million people without electricity. Last year, Croatia and Serbia suffered heavy flooding from rainfalls. And in early June last year, a prolonged heatwave was followed by heavy rains that hit Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The storm then moved into the Ruhr, leading to damages and floods between in the area Dusseldorf and Dortmund.   Heatwaves have been another great challenge in Europe, with particularly warm summers in 2013 and 2014. These events have made governments and cities aware of the necessity to adapt to climate change.   What are the biggest challenges that cities face in dealing with climate-change problems?   Cities face a variety of challenges in adapting to climate change. Lack of knowledge may be the greatest challenge. Many city governments do not know how their city will be affected by climate change. Those cities that wish to take action to prepare for climate change often dont know what actions to take or how to organise their response. And many cities are unaware that there is funding and advice available across Europe.   These challenges are now being addressed. Some national governments have programmes in place to help their cities create adaptation plans. The UK government has a programme called UKCIP and the German government has a programme called KomPass. At the EU-level, there is now an EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change. And the EU has created a website called  Climate-ADAPT , run by the European Environment Agency. Climate-ADAPT helps cities, regions, and national governments learn about climate change adaptation. And there is a European-level organisation specifically established to help cities:  Mayors Adapt .   At ICLEI, we organise conferences like the Bonn Resilient Cities conference and  together with the European Environment Agency  the Open European Day for supporting exchange between city practitioners. We also offer direct climate related services to cities.   Finally, there are also funds available: the EU has set aside 20% of its budget to help cities and countries prevent  and adapt to  climate change. However, many cities are unaware of this funding.   One of the more practical challenges that cities face is in organising their response across administrative levels. Climate change adaptation means making connections across administrative boundaries. For example, if you look at rivers that cross different cities, the responsibility for water management in the urban part of a river might not even lie with the city in question. Things can get even more complicated for rivers like the Rhine and the Danube that cross several countries. Therefore, flood protection related to these rivers means cities need to experiment with new types of governance between cities and countries. In the case of the river Rhine, Switzerland, France, Germany, and the Netherlands all came together in order to plan retention areas for flood water. Cities and countries will need to plan much more in this way in the future in order to adapt to climate change.       Holger Robrecht is the Deputy Regional Director of ICLEI  Local Governments for Sustainability, Europe, an association of over 1 200 regional governments that promotes sustainability in cities.   climate change consequences urban climate change adaptation signals2015 cities,What effects will climate change have on cities?

"mitigating-climate-change  Mitigating climate change  2014 was the hottest year on record. It was also one more year in series of increasingly warm decades. To limit global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels and minimise the impacts of climate change, greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere need to be reduced substantially. Governments can set targets, but it is ultimately up to industry, businesses, local authorities, and households to take action. This action must aim to ensure that emissions are reduced, atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations stabilised, temperature rises halted, and climate change limited.    In 2014, global temperatures were 0.69°C above the 20th century global average .  Scientists agree that the warming is due to atmospheric greenhouse gases emitted mainly as a result of anthropogenic combustion of fossil fuels. This warming in turn causes climate change. Since the industrial revolution, the amount of greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere has steadily been increasing.    Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane are released both naturally and as a result of human activity. Combustion of fossil fuels adds to naturally occurring CO 2  in the atmosphere. Worldwide deforestation amplifies this phenomenon by reducing trees, which remove CO 2  from the atmosphere. Meanwhile, agriculture and poorly managed landfill play a large role in the release of methane. Furthermore, combustion of fossil fuels also leads to the release to the atmosphere of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, and particulate matter. Some of these pollutants can also play a role in warming (or, in the case of aerosols, cooling) our climate.   Due to their persistence in the atmosphere and the non-localised effect of concentrations, the impacts these gases have on the earth’s climate are global issues. This means that a global deal to mitigate emissions is paramount in preventing the continued acceleration of climate change.   A global deal on climate change   This year, the  Conference of Parties (COP)   to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will meet in Paris to coordinate the latest step in the international political response to climate change. Building on two decades of negotiations, COP21 aims to achieve an ambitious, legally binding and global agreement on climate change that will set targets on greenhouse-gas emissions to which all countries should adhere. The agreement is also expected to include objectives and actions on climate change adaptation, focusing on vulnerable developing countries in particular.    The European Union’s efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions are working. In fact, the EU is expected to meet its unilateral 20% reduction target (compared to 1990) ahead of the agreed 2020 deadline. Moreover, the EU intends to reduce domestic emissions by at least 40% by 2030 and further decarbonise its economy by 2050. But despite the EU’s decreasing emissions and its shrinking share of worldwide emissions, global emissions continue to rise.    Government policies and target setting   At COP15, held in Copenhagen in 2009, an aspirational goal of limiting global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels was agreed. COP21 intends to adopt a ‘new instrument’ that translates this limit into actions to be implemented from 2020. Alongside adaptation to existing climate change, efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote the transition towards resilient, low-carbon societies and economies should play a major role in this international agreement.    Prior to COP21, national governments are invited to publicly declare the actions they intend to commit to under the new global agreement  - their   Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs)  .   The European Union and its Member States have already submitted their INDCs, committing to reducing domestic greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990. This binding target will be achieved by the EU as a whole. This target is also in line with the EU objective to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% by 2050 compared to 1990. The UNFCCC intends to publish a synthesis report of these pledges before COP21.     To fulfil these commitments, governments will need to develop and implement effective policies.   For example, the   European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS)  is central to its mitigation efforts.   It limits emissions from some 12 000 power stations and industrial plants across 31 countries by setting a cap on the total amount of greenhouse gases they can emit, and this cap is reduced over time. The European Commission proposes that in 2030 ETS emissions will be 43% lower than they were in 2005. Companies buy and sell emissions allowances, and after a year they must give back enough allowances to the authorities to cover all their emissions or else be subject to heavy fines. The scheme puts a monetary value on carbon, benefitting those that reduce their emissions. It also seeks to encourage investment in clean, low-carbon technologies.    The signals conveyed by governments to polluters are clear: reducing emissions doesn’t just demonstrate environmental good will, it also makes good business sense.   Energy and materials use   The environmental impact of industrial activity comes mainly from energy consumption, chemical production processes, and the use of resources in industrial production. Until recently, it was assumed that greater economic prosperity and growth were intrinsically linked with greater negative environmental impacts. However, in the last two decades, some developed countries have started breaking this link between economic growth and the use of energy and materials. These countries have been using less material and energy to produce the same value of output, while also reducing the amount of carbon released per unit of energy. These phenomena of dematerialisation and decarbonisation have led to reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions. The technological and behavioural drivers behind this decoupling can help developing countries to mitigate their emissions as their economies grow.   The energy supply industry traditionally relied on the combustion of high-carbon fossil fuels to generate electricity. However, the ongoing switch in the short term to more efficient natural gas burning technology, combined with the growth of renewable energy sources, points to a future where this sector’s emissions continue to decline beyond current targets.   In the manufacturing sector, lessons may be learnt from nature. Industrial ecology is a field of study that considers the parallels between industrial and natural systems, and suggests features that industry could adopt. For example, in nature no material is wasted. Anything not needed in a certain process is recycled and transformed for use elsewhere. Waste products resulting from one process become the building blocks of a new one, and the whole system runs on energy from the sun.     Lifecycle assessment (LCA) is increasingly used to understand how such reuse and recycling of energy and materials can contribute to emission reductions. LCA considers total energy use and emissions to air, water, and land as indicators of potential environmental harm. Incorporating LCA into decision-making can bring about environmental benefits and cost savings, while encouraging more economic, and less-polluting alternatives.   Other sectors must also play a role in future emissions reductions. The European Council has agreed to further reduce emissions from sectors not covered by the ETS by 30% compared to 2005. The  EU’s Effort Sharing Decision (ESD)  establishes binding annual targets for individual Member States until 2020 for all the emissions of these sectors, such as transport, buildings, agriculture and waste. Transport is the main source of emissions that is not covered by the EU-ETS.  Emission reductions in the transport sector remain limited,  while projected emissions reductions under  current policies in the agricultural sector are also limited .   Cities and households must also play their part   Climate-change mitigation is not just about industry meeting or going beyond targets. At national, local, and individual levels we all have a role to play. Cities and households in particular need to act to reduce emissions.   Cities are on the frontline of the fight against climate change. In March 2015,  leaders of 30 European cities agreed to use their EUR 10 billion per year collective purchasing power to buy eco-friendly goods and services  in emissions-heavy sectors such as transport, domestic heating, and energy supply. This initiative complements the  Covenant of Mayors , a European movement within which local and regional authorities voluntarily commit to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy resources on their territories. Currently numbering 6 279 signatories, its aim is to meet and exceed the EU’s 20% emissions reduction objective by 2020.   Households are also vital. Consumption patterns can affect emissions both directly and indirectly. Between 2000 and 2007,  households increasingly purchased goods and services with reduced environmental pressures per Euro spent .    In particular, more environmentally-friendly housing, water, transport, food, non-alcoholic beverages, electricity, and other fuels were purchased in this period. However, the increase in total expenditure in many of these consumption categories may have offset the gains.   Such changes in consumption, along with improvements in production processes and services, have resulted in reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions across all consumption categories measured. However, further efficiency gains and a shift towards less environmentally-intensive consumption are needed if global consumption overall continues to increase. Moreover, the impact of European consumption of goods manufactured outside the EU cannot be underestimated.    From global targets to action on the ground   Overall, the message is clear. A climate deal at COP21 is essential. It will go a long way to set targets for emissions reductions and to give clear indications about what needs to be done on both climate-change mitigation and adaptation. Agreeing on emission-reduction targets alone cannot halt climate change. To achieve such targets, well-designed, ambitious, and binding policies leading to emissions reductions are necessary. These policies should provide the catalyst for industry and households to reduce emissions throughout the production and consumption process.   It is clear that emissions from economic activities are closely linked to our consumption patterns. Local authorities, households, and individuals can all exert pressure on existing production systems. Reducing our consumption, and consuming products and services that have less severe impacts on the environment will cause a shift in the way these products and services are produced and sold. Ultimately, climate action starts at home.       climate change mitigation signals2015,In 2014, global temperatures were 0.69°C above the 20th century global average. Scientists agree that the warming is due to atmospheric greenhouse gases emitted mainly as a result of anthropogenic combustion of fossil fuels.

The European Council has agreed to further reduce emissions from sectors not covered by the ETS by 30% compared to 2005. The EU’s Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) establishes binding annual targets for individual Member States until 2020 for all the emissions of these sectors, such as transport, buildings, agriculture and waste. Transport is the main source of emissions that is not covered by the EU-ETS. Emission reductions in the transport sector remain limited, while projected emissions reductions under current policies in the agricultural sector are also limited. Cities and households must also play their part Climate-change mitigation is not just about industry meeting or going beyond targets. At national, local, and individual levels we all have a role to play. Cities and households in particular need to act to reduce emissions. Cities are on the frontline of the fight against climate change. In March 2015, leaders of 30 European cities agreed to use their EUR 10 billion per year collective purchasing power to buy eco-friendly goods and services in emissions-heavy sectors such as transport, domestic heating, and energy supply. This initiative complements the Covenant of Mayors, a European movement within which local and regional authorities voluntarily commit to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy resources on their territories. Currently numbering 6 279 signatories, its aim is to meet and exceed the EU’s 20% emissions reduction objective by 2020. Households are also vital. Consumption patterns can affect emissions both directly and indirectly. Between 2000 and 2007, households increasingly purchased goods and services with reduced environmental pressures per Euro spent.  In particular, more environmentally-friendly housing, water, transport, food, non-alcoholic beverages, electricity, and other fuels were purchased in this period. However, the increase in total expenditure in many of these consumption categories may have offset the gains. Such changes in consumption, along with improvements in production processes and services, have resulted in reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions across all consumption categories measured. However, further efficiency gains and a shift towards less environmentally-intensive consumption are needed if global consumption overall continues to increase. Moreover, the impact of European consumption of goods manufactured outside the EU cannot be underestimated.  From global targets to action on the ground Overall, the message is clear. A climate deal at COP21 is essential. It will go a long way to set targets for emissions reductions and to give clear indications about what needs to be done on both climate-change mitigation and adaptation. Agreeing on emission-reduction targets alone cannot halt climate change. To achieve such targets, well-designed, ambitious, and binding policies leading to emissions reductions are necessary. These policies should provide the catalyst for industry and households to reduce emissions throughout the production and consumption process. It is clear that emissions from economic activities are closely linked to our consumption patterns. Local authorities, households, and individuals can all exert pressure on existing production systems. Reducing our consumption, and consuming products and services that have less severe impacts on the environment will cause a shift in the way these products and services are produced and sold. Ultimately, climate action starts at home. "
"living-in-a-changing-climate  Living in a changing climate  Our climate is changing. Warmer temperatures, changes in precipitation levels and patterns, or extreme weather events are already impacting Europe, and these impacts result in real losses.

"europe2019s-seas-productive-but-not  Europe’s seas: productive, but not healthy or clean  blue growth eu marine strategy framework directive maritime sector    The European Union’s Blue Growth agenda aims to harness further the potential of Europe’s oceans, seas and coasts for jobs, economic value and sustainability. A new report published today by the European Environment Agency (EEA) shows that, despite some improvements, the way we use our seas remains unsustainable and threatens not only the productivity of our seas, but also our wellbeing. Human activities and climate change are increasingly putting a number of pressures on Europe’s seas, the cumulative effects of which threaten the functioning and resilience of marine ecosystems.   In line with the development of the European Union’s (EU) Blue Growth objectives, which aspire to greater and sustainable use of the seas’ potential, the EEA’s new ‘ State of Europe’s seas ’ report examines whether the EU is meeting its policy goals for the quality of the marine environment.   From fisheries to offshore energy production, and protection of marine biodiversity, the EU has a range of policies related to planning and regulating the sustainable use of Europe’s seas. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive, adopted in 2008, aims to ensure coherence between such EU policies and sets three goals for Europe’s seas: to be ‘productive’, ‘healthy’, and ‘clean’. Based on the data available, the EEA finds that although Europe’s seas can be considered productive, they cannot be considered healthy or clean.   The report also looks into describing what ecosystem-based management could mean in the marine context and how to improve our knowledge, as well as considering future challenges in relation to the long-term sustainability of Europe’s seas.   Pressures on the rise   Seas are home to a wide variety of marine life and contain ecosystems essential for life on our planet. They are also an important source of food, raw material, medicine, energy, and are used as global highways for trade.   Only a very limited number of assessments of marine habitats and species indicate favourable conservation status. Current pressures include, among others, physical damage to the seafloor (due to bottom-trawling in particular), introduction of non-indigenous species, nutrient input (mainly from agricultural fertilisers), hazardous substance pollution and marine litter. Climate change induced temperature increases and potential ocean acidification can further weaken the ecological resilience of Europe’s Seas.   A large part of the pressures arises from activities at sea, such as the extraction and production of living resources (fish, shellfish, etc.), transport and energy production, or pollution such as marine litter. Land-based activities — such as the use of agricultural fertilisers and industrial chemicals, and wastewater — also add to the pressures. Human activities are reaching levels that threaten the productivity and resilience of our seas, and our wellbeing. Degrading the oceans’ life-support function could actually mean crossing a critical planetary boundary.   ‘We need to respect the ecological boundaries of Europe’s seas if we want to continue enjoying the benefits we receive. This requires aligning our policy ambitions for economic growth with our policy targets of securing healthy, clean and productive seas. Ultimately, this will entail making fundamental changes in the way we meet our societal needs’, said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. ‘Seas are part of our European natural capital and their protection and exploitation require a European approach. In many cases, it also requires a global approach. Our report contributes to the knowledge base needed for relevant policy discussions, currently ongoing at European and global levels,’ added Bruyninckx.   Selection of facts from the report      For species and habitats assessed from 2007 to 2012 under the EU’s Habitats Directive, 9% of marine habitats and 7% of marine species assessments were in ‘favourable conservation status’, while 66% of habitat and 27% of species assessments were ‘unfavourable’.     Over 650 marine fish species, over 180 marine bird species, five species of sea turtles and almost 40% of the world’s known marine mammals are found in Europe’s seas.     Around 320 new non-indigenous species have been observed in Europe’s seas since 2000.     The knowledge base on marine biodiversity remains very limited, calling for greater cooperation among EU countries and with other countries bordering the regional seas of Europe.     Climate change is already affecting Europe’s marine ecosystems.     Hazardous substances are widespread in the marine environment. They can accumulate through the marine food chain and pose health risks to humans.     Marine litter, mainly in the form of plastic, is also accumulating in Europe’s seas. Most of the litter comes from land-based activities. Micro-plastics can enter the food web.     Underwater noise from human activities (shipping, renewable energy, oil and gas extraction, etc.) is increasing and can have a wide range of impacts on marine life.     Signs of improvement are observed in certain pressures, such as fishing and nutrient loading.     More than half of the commercial fish stocks assessed are not in good environmental status.     Total catches in all fishing regions have been declining in the past ten years. The EU is increasingly dependent on imports of its most widely consumed species: tuna, cod and salmon.

"nature-policy-works-when-implemented-well  Nature policy works when implemented well  Our natural environment is a key component of our health and wealth. However, our recent assessments show that the majority of habitats and species in Europe have an unfavourable conservation status despite significant improvements for many species in recent years.    The results are mixed, but clear. When implemented well, conservation measures work and improve the status of habitats and species on the ground. Nevertheless, improvements remain limited and patchy, and, unfortunately, Europe's biodiversity is still eroding and the pressures continue.   Biodiversity loss ongoing   Under the  Habitats Directive  reporting, 77% of habitats and 60% of species assessments are unfavourable while only 16% of habitats and 23% of species assessments are favourable.    Data on population trends show both worrying and encouraging results. On the one hand, there has been a dramatic decline in grassland butterflies of almost 50% between 1990 and 2011.     Europe's common bird populations have declined by 12% since 1990, while common farmland birds have declined by 30%. Both trends are closely linked to pressures from agricultural activities.     Over half of the bird species in the EU are considered to be 'secure' – with no foreseeable risk of extinction. Many bird species for which Member States set up special protection areas have recorded increases in their populations, but most of these species still face risk of extinction. Other bird species, including many that may be hunted, show declining populations.     On the other hand, some populations of European bats     and large carnivores     appear to have recovered to some extent from past declines, demonstrating positive results of conservation action and unplanned changes such as land abandonment. However, these improvements are currently limited to local or regional level, and have not yet scaled up to European level.     Pressures persist    As stated in our recent assessment ' State of Nature in the EU ' as well as in our integrated assessment ' The European environment – state and outlook 2015 ', human activities continue to exert pressure on Europe's nature.    Habitat change — including loss, fragmentation and degradation — due to land-use change remains one of the main pressures. More concretely, urban sprawl and grey infrastructure developments cause fragmentation of the rural landscape. Similarly, agricultural intensification, intensive forest management and land abandonment cause homogenisation and loss of habitat.      Over-exploitation of natural resources, in particular through certain malpractices in fisheries, and the accelerated establishment and spread of invasive alien species also continue to cause concern. More than 12 000 alien species now occur in Europe. They do not only cause biodiversity loss, but also considerable economic damage to agriculture, forestry and fisheries. They also hamper ecosystems' capability to deliver services, which we depend on.     Moreover, climate change is already affecting some species' and specific habitats' distribution, range and interaction and is projected to become a more significant threat in the coming decades.     Way forward: implementation and integration    European policies and efforts by Member States, including expansion of protected areas, have made some improvements on the ground. Today,  Natura 2000  – the network of protected areas created by the EU's Habitats Directive – covers 18% of EU land and 4% of EU marine waters. With this achievement, the EU has met its part of the Aichi target for global coverage of protected areas by 2020 of at least 17% of the terrestrial and inland water areas. The target of protecting 10% of the coastal and marine areas remains to be met.    Encouragingly, some pollution pressures have decreased such as the nutrient enrichment of European waters and the balance of nitrogen found on farmland. However, given the already high levels of nitrogen in ecosystems, the eutrophication risk is predicted to remain high in 2020.      It will be very challenging for Europe to meet the overall target of halting the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services by 2020. Many of the influences on biodiversity loss, arise from a range of sectors and policies that exerts considerable pressure on biodiversity. Biodiversity concerns need to be effectively integrated into sectors such as agriculture, forestry and fisheries, as well as into various policies, regional, cohesion and climate policies in particular. This can increase ecosystem resilience and provide nature-based solutions to climate change adaptation.    In addition to integration into sectors, a full and effective implementation of the  EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020  is a vital step towards halting biodiversity loss. Conserving and managing the Natura 2000 network effectively, and developing green infrastructure, such as wildlife corridors, and restoring degraded ecosystems are additional steps to protect Europe's biodiversity.    We also need to understand that when dealing with maintaining and enhancing biodiversity, it takes time for our actions to make a difference on a large scale. Moreover, European efforts to halt biodiversity loss on its continent should ensure that pressures are not transferred to other parts of our increasingly globalised world thereby exacerbating global biodiversity loss.         Hans Bruyninckx   EEA Executive Director   Editorial  published in the issue no.2015/2 of the EEA newsletter, June 2015.    birds directive conservation status habitats directive natura 2000,The results are mixed, but clear.

"land-and-soil-losing-ground  Land and soil losing ground to human activities  Land and soil are essential for natural systems and human society, but human activities threaten the functioning of the overall land resource, including soil. Why is this happening? What is Europe doing to prevent it? 2015 is the International Year of Soils, so we put these questions to Geertrui Louwagie, project manager for soil assessments and reporting at the European Environment Agency.   What are the issues facing land and soil?   Land and soil are finite, non-renewable resources, which continue to degrade, affecting their ability to function and deliver services. Food growing, biomass and biofuel production, carbon storage, the hosting of soil biodiversity, the filtering of water and cycling of nutrients, and the provision of raw materials are under increasing pressure. The natural and archaeological heritage of soil is also being jeopardised.   A number of processes contribute to this degradation including soil erosion, the decline of soil organic matter, soil contamination and soil sealing (soil covered by impervious surfaces, also called imperviousness.) These are driven by human activities like  land take , land use intensity (among others reflected in the amount of nutrients used on rural land) and land abandonment. Each process has an impact on the main dimensions of land: land cover/land use, vegetation and soil. These determine the land resource stocks and functioning, and the derived flows of goods and services. They also affect the intrinsic value of land and its contribution to human wellbeing and welfare.    What is being done to tackle these issues?   The  United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  will set targets for the global effort to tackle land and soil related problems. In this context, the  Global Land Indicators Initiative  was introduced in 2012 to develop a set of globally collectible land indicators that are comparable over the long term. The initiative, which initially focused on land rights, also aims to influence the post-2015 global agenda. However, the environmental component was missing from the suggested indicators. To rectify this, the EEA and the  Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies  proposed  land and soil indicators to monitor the achievement of the SDGs  in terms of changes in land cover/land use, land productivity and soil organic carbon.   How does the EEA contribute to this work?   Our work feeds into the development of EU land and soil policy. The recent European  assessment  of soil's ability to deliver ecosystem services is one example. Our  Multi-Annual Work Programme  also deals with land resource efficiency and ecosystem assessment and capital accounting.   Land resource efficiency studies the balance between the supply of land and the functional demands on it. It recognises that land is finite and non-renewable, and considers how land cover changes, e.g. for infrastructure and industrial purposes, affect the services that land can deliver. It also includes land recycling as a response to land take, promoting the reuse of land that has been developed on but abandoned.   Work on the balance of soil nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as metals like copper, zinc, cadmium and lead contributes to the EEA's ecosystem assessment and capital accounting projects. EU and national budgets were estimated in 2014, and critical load exceedances of ammonia emission deposition with respect to biodiversity, nitrogen and phosphorus leaching and run off with respect to ground and surface water, and cadmium uptake in relation to food quality are currently being examined.   The EEA wants harmonised data on these issues, leading to comparable country data throughout Europe. As such, it cooperates with the  Joint Research Centre (JRC) , which collects soil data under the mandate of the  European Soil Data Centre . Land data comes from satellite observations from  Corine Land Cover (CLC)  and the High Resolution Layers (HRLs), including  imperviousness .   To increase the visibility of land and soil, the EEA has also created a thematic cluster of indicators. This currently comprises  land take , imperviousness,  management of contaminated sites  and land fragmentation and includes indicators derived from climate change work including  soil organic matter ,  soil erosion  and  soil moisture .   What about land and soil policy?   EU policy that is relevant to land and soil is fragmented and existing provisions in environmental, agricultural or regional policies are neither coordinated nor comprehensive. The  Soil Thematic Strategy 2006  is a guiding document, which explains why further action is needed to ensure a high level of protection of soil functions and the sustainable use of soils. However, a Soil Framework Directive, proposed in 2006, was withdrawn last year.   The European Commission plans to study existing EU and national policies that are relevant to soil, their effectiveness and coherence, and any gaps there might be. This is in response to the  7 th  Environment Action Programme , in which the EU commits to use and manage land sustainably and protect soil, and find ways to best achieve this based on proportionality and subsidiarity principles.   Globally, UN Member States are expected to agree on the SDGs in September. With the current wording, land and soil are included in several targets. However, reversing the trend of losing land and soil resources globally depends on the  implementation of the SDGs  at national and sub-national level.

It also includes land recycling as a response to land take, promoting the reuse of land that has been developed on but abandoned. Work on the balance of soil nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as metals like copper, zinc, cadmium and lead contributes to the EEA's ecosystem assessment and capital accounting projects. EU and national budgets were estimated in 2014, and critical load exceedances of ammonia emission deposition with respect to biodiversity, nitrogen and phosphorus leaching and run off with respect to ground and surface water, and cadmium uptake in relation to food quality are currently being examined. The EEA wants harmonised data on these issues, leading to comparable country data throughout Europe. As such, it cooperates with the Joint Research Centre (JRC), which collects soil data under the mandate of the European Soil Data Centre. Land data comes from satellite observations from Corine Land Cover (CLC) and the High Resolution Layers (HRLs), including imperviousness. To increase the visibility of land and soil, the EEA has also created a thematic cluster of indicators. This currently comprises land take, imperviousness, management of contaminated sites and land fragmentation and includes indicators derived from climate change work including soil organic matter, soil erosion and soil moisture. What about land and soil policy? EU policy that is relevant to land and soil is fragmented and existing provisions in environmental, agricultural or regional policies are neither coordinated nor comprehensive. The Soil Thematic Strategy 2006 is a guiding document, which explains why further action is needed to ensure a high level of protection of soil functions and the sustainable use of soils. However, a Soil Framework Directive, proposed in 2006, was withdrawn last year. The European Commission plans to study existing EU and national policies that are relevant to soil, their effectiveness and coherence, and any gaps there might be. This is in response to the 7th Environment Action Programme, in which the EU commits to use and manage land sustainably and protect soil, and find ways to best achieve this based on proportionality and subsidiarity principles. Globally, UN Member States are expected to agree on the SDGs in September. With the current wording, land and soil are included in several targets. However, reversing the trend of losing land and soil resources globally depends on the implementation of the SDGs at national and sub-national level.

"many-european-countries2019-air-pollutant  Many European countries' air pollutant emissions above legal limits  Air pollutant emissions in the EU continue to exceed legal limits, according to a report from the European Environment Agency (EEA) published today. Preliminary data for 2013 shows that ten EU Member States exceeded one or more of their emission ceilings for key pollutants.   Under the  National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive , EU Member States have individual air pollutant emission limits, or 'ceilings', for sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), ammonia (NH 3 ) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC). As of 2010, Member States should not have exceeded their emission ceilings, but the EEA report ' NEC Directive status report 2014 ', which includes preliminary data for 2013 and summarises data for 2010-12, confirms that a number of countries did so for these years.   The four pollutants addressed in the directive harm human health and the environment, causing respiratory illnesses, acidifying soil and surface waters, and damaging vegetation.   Key findings     Ten Member States exceeded at least one ceiling in 2013. Germany was the only country that exceeded three of the four emission ceilings (NO x , NMVOCs and NH 3 ), while Austria (NO x  and NH 3 ), Denmark (NMVOCs and NH 3 ) and Ireland (NO x  and NMVOCs) exceeded two ceilings in 2013.   The following six Member States - Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland and Luxembourg - exceeded their NO x  emission ceilings in all years from 2010-2013. In 2013, Germany and France reported the highest exceedances of NO x  limits with 218 kilotonnes and 180 kilotonnes, respectively. In percentage terms, Luxembourg (41%) and Austria (32%) exceeded their NO x  emission ceilings by the greatest amount in 2013.   Emissions from road transport is one of the main reasons for the large number of NO x  exceedances. NO x  reductions from the road transport sector have been lower than originally anticipated over the last two decades, partly because transport has grown more than expected, and partly owing to the increased number of diesel vehicles producing higher NO x  emissions than petrol-fuelled vehicles. It is also an issue that ‘real-world emissions’ often exceed the permitted test-cycle emissions used for certification of vehicles complying with Euro standards. This is particularly true for light-duty diesel vehicles.   Six Member States also have persistent problems meeting their national emission limits for NH 3 . Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands and Spain all breached the ceilings for four years running (2010-13).    Almost 95% of NH  3   emissions stem from agriculture, mainly from the use of fertilisers and the handling of animal manure. NH  3   emissions have decreased since 1990, but not to the same extent as the other pollutants covered by the NEC Directive.     The ceilings for sulphur dioxide (SO  2  ) emissions were not exceeded by any Member State between 2010 and 2013.      Table ES 1: EU-27 Member State progress in meeting NECD emission ceiling          'v' indicates that the emission ceiling has been attained; 'x' indicates the ceiling has not been attained.

"how-vulnerable-are-cities-to  How vulnerable are cities to climate change?  The European Environment Agency (EEA) published today a series of interactive maps, illustrating various climate threats European cities face as well as cities’ capacity to respond to these threats. This new ‘map book’ provides background information and allows users to view the maps, selecting different parameters.   Climate change is impacting and will continue to impact the European continent. However, climate impacts vary across Europe. More than three quarters of Europeans live in cities. Urban residents, city authorities, national and EU institutions need information about how cities will be affected and how to plan accordingly.   The EEA has brought all the relevant data available for cities across Europe together in an interactive ‘ urban vulnerability map book ’ on the European Climate Adaptation portal  Climate-ADAPT . The maps are clustered around four climate threats (heatwaves, drought and water scarcity, flooding and forest fires) and cities’ capacity to respond. The map book shows how different factors, such as the amount of green urban areas, the share of elderly people or levels of trust and financial resources, interact at city level and determine the vulnerability of the cities included.   Explore cities’ vulnerability   For example, the map of thermal comfort shows the effect of the urban heat island. Cities in northern and western Europe can expect more heatwave days in the future. For example, a specific  regional analysis for cities in the Randstad area  (Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague) in the Netherlands indicates that even in cities currently experiencing hardly any warm nights, heat stress at night can be felt more than a month per year.   Green urban areas help cool cities. In addition to their overall share in the urban surface area, their distribution in the city and the presence or lack of a green hinterland also play a role. For example, Badajoz in Spain and Sassari in Italy have a relatively high share of green urban areas but these areas are clustered in a few places in the city. Nevertheless, they benefit from a green hinterland. In contrast, Porto in Portugal has a low share of green urban areas but they are evenly distributed across the city allowing easy access to cooler open space.   Demographics can also affect cities’ vulnerability to climate impacts. In general, the elderly are more sensitive to health risks posed by heat waves. For example, cities in northern Italy have shares of elderly people higher than the country average, suggesting that high temperatures might require specific attention in the area.   The map book provides a first indication of cities’ vulnerability and can be supplemented with more detailed local data. The section ‘Explore further’ guides users to create their own web maps by adding supplementary data. The section also provides links to other information sources and tools. These include the recently developed  time series tool   (developed by the JRC Institute for Environment and Sustainability) , which shows the past development and future projections of different climate variables such as temperature, rainfall or solar radiation. The data presented in the maps and the time series tool were provided by various organisations (including Eurostat and JRC).

"green-week-stakeholders-put-nature  Green Week: stakeholders put nature in the spotlight  Stakeholders from across Europe are coming together at Green Week to discuss biodiversity and ecosystem services in Europe. The European Environment Agency (EEA) will present its latest findings, recently published in its reports  'State of nature in the EU' and 'The European Environment – state and outlook 2015'. To contribute to the knowledge base, the EEA released today a new technical report on mapping and assessment of ecosystems.   Every year the European Commission's  Directorate-General for the Environment  brings together policy makers, researchers, civil society, businesses and other stakeholders at a large conference in Brussels, Belgium, around an environmental topic central to European environmental policy debate. This year's  Green Week  focuses on nature and biodiversity. Green Week 2015 will look at the benefits we receive from nature, and the framework in place to protect it.   The European Environment Agency's recent assessments, including  The European environment – state and outlook 2015  and  State of Nature in the EU , show that Europe's biodiversity is still being eroded, despite significant local improvements. To halt the loss of biodiversity, stabilise and restore degraded ecosystems, the European Union has adopted the  EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 , which sets various targets and actions. An effective implementation of the strategy depends, among others, on the data and information available on biodiversity in Europe. Through its extensive network and close collaboration with partners, the EEA contributes extensively to the knowledge base on Europe's biodiversity.   How to map and assess ecosystems   As part of its contributions to this knowledge base, the EEA published today its new technical report ' European ecosystem assessment – concept, data, and implementation '. The report aims at supporting the implementation of EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, more concretely to Target 2 Action 5 – Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES). It describes, among others, the conceptual framework to map and assess ecosystems in detail as well as the mapping and assessment process. By outlining a coherent framework, the report aims to support Member States and Commission services tasked to carry out ecosystem assessments and making use of the outcomes.   There are different strands of information and data, which can be used in mapping and assessing ecosystems in Europe. The report uses the DPSIR (Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact, Response) approach to put all the relevant information available in a coherent context. The Millennium Assessment identified five major groups of pressures: habitat change, climate change, invasive species, land use management, and pollution and nutrient enrichment. The report builds on these five groups and provides how different ecosystem types (e.g. cropland, forests, freshwater) are affected by each pressure group. The report includes a series of maps of Europe, showing different types of ecosystem-based assessments that can be carried out with the available knowledge. The report also identifies data and knowledge gaps, which can help improve assessments if filled.   The EEA's findings and other information sources will be presented throughout the conference.

"cherishing-nature-world-biodiversity-day  Cherishing nature: World Biodiversity Day  Today, 22 May, is the International Day for Biological Diversity. We are currently witnessing a steady loss of biodiversity, with profound consequences for the natural world and for human well-being.

"state-of-nature-in-the  State of nature in the EU: biodiversity still being eroded, but some local improvements observed  The majority of habitats and species in Europe have an unfavourable conservation status despite significant improvements for many species in recent years, according to a new technical report published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today. The report presents the most comprehensive European overview on the conservation status and trends of the habitats and species covered by the European Union’s (EU) two nature directives. Building on the reports submitted by EU member states, the report contributes to policy discussions in the context of the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy.   The two nature directives, namely the Birds and Habitats directives, play a central role in the  EU’s biodiversity  and nature conservation policies. Under the directives, EU Member States are required to assess and report every six years on the status and trends of certain species and habitats. The EEA technical report  State of Nature in the EU: Results from reporting under the nature directives 2007-2012  draws on the assessments submitted by Member States under both directives and provides a comprehensive overview of the state of nature in Europe at European, country and biogeographic level. The report also looks into main pressures and threats behind the trends observed.    Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said, ‘This unique assessment is a first of its kind, building on extensive observation networks of experts and citizens alike. Despite some information gaps, it provides the most complete picture of Europe’s biodiversity to date.’ Bruyninckx added, ‘The results are mixed but clear. When implemented well, conservation measures work and improve the status of habitats and species on the ground. Such improvements remain limited and patchy, and unfortunately Europe’s biodiversity is still being eroded overall and the pressures continue. We also need to understand that when dealing with maintaining and enhancing biodiversity, it takes time for our actions to make a difference on a large scale. Therefore, we need to reinforce our effort and actions.’    Moreover, the EEA’s report informs on progress towards Targets 1 and 3 of the  EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy . These findings will serve as an input to the  European Commission’s  upcoming Mid-Term Review of the EU Biodiversity Strategy.    Key findings:       Over half of the bird species in the EU are considered to be ‘secure’, i.e. with no foreseeable risk of extinction.     Many bird species, for which the Birds Directive requires Member States to set up special protection areas (species listed in Annex I), have recorded increases in their populations, although often these species are not considered secure. Other bird species, including many that may be hunted (species listed in Annex II), show declining populations.     Under the Habitats Directive, only 16% of habitats and 23% of species assessments are ‘favourable’, while 77% of habitats and 60% of species assessments are ‘unfavourable’.     The status of many species, e.g. birds of prey and many large carnivores, has shown significant improvements in some areas, but these improvements are currently limited to local or regional level, and have not yet scaled up to European level.     The Natura 2000 network (created by the Habitats Directive) covers 18% of the EU’s land surface and 4% of its seas. Natura 2000 appears to be an effective conservation measure, which also benefits non-target species.     In relation to Target 1 (halting the deterioration in the status of all species and habitats and achieving significant improvements) of the Biodiversity Strategy, only 21% of habitat and 28% of species assessments are favourable or improving. Moreover, a significant share of previously unfavourable assessments have deteriorated further (30% for habitats and 22% for species).     In relation to Target 3 (increasing the contribution of agriculture and forestry to maintaining and enhancing biodiversity), species and habitats depending on agricultural ecosystems are doing worse than general assessments, while species and habitats depending on forest ecosystems have a similar and worrying conservation status to other species and habitats in general.     Member States reported on pressures and threats for each habitat and species. Agricultural activities, artificialisation of rivers and lakes and water abstraction were the most frequently reported pressures that have high negative impacts on the state of nature.      Complementary information and data on individual species and habitats, as well as country data and summaries can be found at  EEA biodiversity data centre  and  European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity  website.    Background information    The reporting under the Birds Directive covers all species of naturally occurring wild birds in Europe, while the reports under the Habitats Directive only cover a selection of habitats and species that are considered rare and/or endangered. Given this difference, the species reports under the Habitats Directive have a higher proportion of ‘unfavourable’ status than the reports under the Birds Directive.    Under the Birds Directive, the bird population status can be ‘secure’, ‘near threatened, declining or depleted’, ‘threatened’ or ‘unknown’ where data is not sufficient to allow an assessment.    Under the Habitats Directive, the conservation status can be ‘favourable’, ‘unfavourable-inadequate’, ‘unfavourable-bad’, or ‘unknown’. For ‘unfavourable’ assessments, the trend was also classified as ‘unfavourable-improving’, ‘unfavourable-stable’, ‘unfavourable-declining’ and ‘unfavourable-unknown’.    Several hundreds of experts across the EU were involved in collecting, processing and reporting the data and the information, which formed the basis of the country reports and this EEA report. A large number of citizens also took part in monitoring many species. However, despite this extensive effort, there are still information gaps and Member States have to invest more in monitoring species and habitats.

Under the directives, EU Member States are required to assess and report every six years on the status and trends of certain species and habitats. The EEA technical report State of Nature in the EU: Results from reporting under the nature directives 2007-2012 draws on the assessments submitted by Member States under both directives and provides a comprehensive overview of the state of nature in Europe at European, country and biogeographic level. The report also looks into main pressures and threats behind the trends observed. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said, ‘This unique assessment is a first of its kind, building on extensive observation networks of experts and citizens alike. Despite some information gaps, it provides the most complete picture of Europe’s biodiversity to date.’ Bruyninckx added, ‘The results are mixed but clear. When implemented well, conservation measures work and improve the status of habitats and species on the ground. Such improvements remain limited and patchy, and unfortunately Europe’s biodiversity is still being eroded overall and the pressures continue. We also need to understand that when dealing with maintaining and enhancing biodiversity, it takes time for our actions to make a difference on a large scale. Therefore, we need to reinforce our effort and actions.’ Moreover, the EEA’s report informs on progress towards Targets 1 and 3 of the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy. These findings will serve as an input to the European Commission’s upcoming Mid-Term Review of the EU Biodiversity Strategy. Key findings:  Over half of the bird species in the EU are considered to be ‘secure’, i.e. with no foreseeable risk of extinction. Many bird species, for which the Birds Directive requires Member States to set up special protection areas (species listed in Annex I), have recorded increases in their populations, although often these species are not considered secure. Other bird species, including many that may be hunted (species listed in Annex II), show declining populations. Under the Habitats Directive, only 16% of habitats and 23% of species assessments are ‘favourable’, while 77% of habitats and 60% of species assessments are ‘unfavourable’. The status of many species, e.g. birds of prey and many large carnivores, has shown significant improvements in some areas, but these improvements are currently limited to local or regional level, and have not yet scaled up to European level. The Natura 2000 network (created by the Habitats Directive) covers 18% of the EU’s land surface and 4% of its seas. Natura 2000 appears to be an effective conservation measure, which also benefits non-target species. In relation to Target 1 (halting the deterioration in the status of all species and habitats and achieving significant improvements) of the Biodiversity Strategy, only 21% of habitat and 28% of species assessments are favourable or improving. Moreover, a significant share of previously unfavourable assessments have deteriorated further (30% for habitats and 22% for species). In relation to Target 3 (increasing the contribution of agriculture and forestry to maintaining and enhancing biodiversity), species and habitats depending on agricultural ecosystems are doing worse than general assessments, while species and habitats depending on forest ecosystems have a similar and worrying conservation status to other species and habitats in general. Member States reported on pressures and threats for each habitat and species.

"assessment  Population change  Outlook from UN DESA   The worlds population increased from 2.5 billion in 1950 to around 7 billion in 2010, and is expected to continue to rise until 2050/2100 under most UN projection variants. Assuming the medium fertility projection variant, global population might increase to 9.6 billion by 2050, rising to 10.9 billion by 2100. However, if fertility and mortality rates stay at current levels (i.e. assuming the no change projection variant), growth rates would be substantially higher, and the global population could rise to 10.2 billion by 2050 and 19.9 billion by 2100.   Expected global population growth is projected to be largely driven by increases in Asia and particularly in Africa. While the Asian population is expected to peak by 2050, Africas population is projected to grow strongly and continuously, from about 1 billion today to more than 4 billion by 2100, under medium fertility assumptions.   The total population of the 28 EU Member States is projected to slightly increase from the current figure of 505 million to 520 million by 2030, and then to decrease in the subsequent decades to some 475 million by 2100, under medium fertility assumptions. The age structure is projected to change substantially, with an increase of the share of people aged 65 years or older from the current figure of 17% to over 30% by 2050, under medium fertility assumptions.   human population Outlook Outlook042 042,The world population has almost tripled over the last 60 years, rising from circa 2.5 billion in 1950 to around 7 billion in 2010 (Figure 1). As shown in Figure 1, there is significant variation across the different UN projection variants as to how global population might develop over the coming decades. By 2050, global population is projected to be in a range between 8.3 billion (low fertility projection variant) and 11.1 billion (constant fertility projection variant). Assuming the medium fertility projection variant, global population is expected to increase to 9.6 billion by 2050. The spread across the different UN projection variants increases further for the period 2050 to 2100, reflecting the increasing uncertainties inherent in such long term projections. According to the low fertility projection variant, global population might peak around 2050 and decrease to 6.8 billion by 2100. At the other extreme, under the assumption of constant fertility rates (as of 2005 to 2010)but increasing life expectancy (e.g. due to improved health care systems), global population could increase to as much as 28.6 billion by 2100. If both fertility rates and life expectancy remained constant as of 2005 to 2010 (no change projection variant), the global population could reach 19.9 billion by 2100. Assuming the medium fertility projection variant, that is globally increasing life expectancy combined with increasing fertility rates in currently low fertility regions but decreasing fertility rates in currently very high fertility regions, global population is expected to increase to 10.9 billion by 2100 (Figure 1). The huge spread across the UN projection variants towards the end of the 21st century also illustrates the effects of alternative assumptions related to fertility and mortality. For example, the considerably higher number for the constant fertility compared to the no change projection variant is due to the assumption of life expectancy increasing with time in the constant fertility projection variant. Moreover, the lower values of the high fertility projection variant in comparison with the constant fertility and no change projection variants illustrate that the high fertility projection variant actually assumes a considerable reduction in fertility rates in many countries, compared to current levels. The assumption of the medium variant, therefore, is that fertility rates will experience a stronger drop, compared to what is assumed for the high fertility projection variant. A more detailed analysis of the medium fertility scenario by world regions reveals that the projected increase in global population is largely driven by increases in Asia and Africa. The Asian population tripled between 1950 and 2010, rising from 1.4 billion to 4.2 billion, and Asia is projected to remain the most populous world region throughout the 21st century (Figure 2). Its total population is projected to increase by another billion to 5.2 billion by 2050, but to slightly decrease to 4.7 billion by 2100. Africas population increased five-fold between 1950 and 2010, rising from around 200 million to 1 billion, and it is projected to substantially and continuously grow to 2.4 billion and 4.2 billion by 2050 and 2100, respectively (Figure 2). Details on the historical development and future projections of Europes population are given in the specific assessment of this indicator.,The population of the current 28 EU member countries increased from 380 million in 1950 to 505 million in 2010 (Figure 3). The medium fertility projection variant assumes a relatively stable EU-28 population throughout the 21st century, with a slight increase to 520 million by 2030, and then a decrease in the subsequent decades to 475 million by 2100 (Figure 3). Other UN projection variants assume stronger changes in total EU population over time and most of them predict a considerable population decline. The strongest declines occur under low fertility, and, particularly, under no change assumptions. If fertility rates, life expectancy and migration rates stay at current levels, the EU-28 population would drop to 270 million by 2100, which is almost half of its current size. Only under high fertility and instant replacement assumptions, the EU-28 population would grow towards 2100 (to 725 million and 620 million, respectively, Figure 3). Strongly linked to the projected trend of a decreasing EU population is the growing share of older individuals. The share of persons aged 65 years and older of the total EU population doubled between 1950 and 2010, rising from 8.8% to 17.5% (Figure 4). Over the coming decades, the EU ageing trend is projected to continue. By 2050, the share of persons 65 years and older is projected to be in the range between 26% (high fertility' scenario) to 33% (low fertility scenario), and might further increase to over 40% by 2100 under low fertility assumptions (Figure 4). Ageing populations are also projected to become a global phenomenon in the next decades  for example assuming the medium fertility variant, the global share of persons aged 65 and older is projected to rise from the figure of current 8% to 16% and 22% by 2050 and 2100, respectively (Figure 4). Population trends across EU member countries are more complex, with the population of some countries projected to decrease significantly, while others are projected to increase between now and 2100. Thus, the national level assessment of this indicator is limited to exploring some of the most striking trends according to the medium variant scenario. For example, by around 2050 Germany is projected to be replaced as the most populous EU Member State by either France or the United Kingdom (Figure 5). As the UKs population increase is predicated, in part, upon substantial levels of immigration, trends in migration might play a role in determining whether France or the UK will be Europes largest. Other currently populous EU countries, such as Romania, Poland and Italy, are projected to experience a continuous and significant drop in population (Figure 5). A comparison of changes in total population from 2010 to 2100 across the EU28 and EEA member countries shows that particularly eastern European countries, but also countries such as Germany or Portugal, are projected to be affected by large-scale population decreases (see Figure 6). In contrast, the population size of many northern and western European countries is projected to rise. Particularly strong increases are projected for Ireland, Sweden, Norway and Switzerland, in part driven by assumptions about immigration and increased life expectancy. Another assessment of EU population trends has been published recently by the European Commission (EC, 2014).

"Around 1.4 million new vans were registered in the European Union in 2014, with average emissions of 169.2 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilometre, 4 g CO2/km less than those sold in 2013. This is significantly below the 2017 target of 175 g CO2/km, which was already reached in 2013, four years ahead of schedule. The data is published by the European Environment Agency (EEA), which started monitoring the emissions of light commercial vehicles in 2012. Final data will be published in the autumn after van manufacturers verify this preliminary data. Key findings:   The EU market for vans grew by 18% in 2014. Registrations increased in all EU Member States compared to 2013, except for Malta and the Netherlands. More than 60% of the vehicles were registered in three countries: France (24%), United Kingdom (21%) and Germany (15%). Diesel vehicles make up the vast majority of van sales (97%). Alternative fuel vehicles using, for example, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) or natural gas (NG), represent less than 2% of the fleet, with electric vehicle sales comprising less than 0.5%. The average emission levels vary across Europe. Slightly more efficient models were bought in the pre-2004 EU Member States (169.0 g CO2/km) compared to the EU Member States that joined after 2004 (171.6 g CO2/km).  Emissions levels were lowest among new vans sold in Portugal (145.1 g CO2/km), Malta (145.7 g CO2/km) and Bulgaria (148.6 g CO2/km). At the other end of the scale, emissions were approximately 30% higher for the average vans sold in Slovakia (193.3 gCO2/km), the Czech Republic (191.1 g CO2/km) and Germany (190.4 g CO2/km).    The increasing fuel efficiency of vans observed in 2014 is similar to that recently reported by the EEA for new passenger cars sold, which improved by 2.6% between 2013 and 2014.   Background  Member States report CO2 emission levels based upon a certification test procedure. These levels are measured under laboratory conditions using the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) as specified in EU legislation. This certification procedure is designed to make the measurements for all vehicles comparable, but it does not necessarily represent real-world conditions.  Many vehicles classified as vans under EU legislation are built in several stages involving in most cases a base vehicle (chassis and cab) built by the vehicle manufacturer and a second stage body builder that is responsible for adapting the vehicle for its final purpose. According to EU legislation, it is in most cases only the base vehicle that undergoes the CO2 emissions test. As a consequence, it is the base vehicle manufacturer that is legally responsible for the CO2 emissions of the final vehicle. The vans emissions data compiled by the EEA is therefore more complex than that of passenger cars. In 2014, a new data collection method has been applied with the aim of improving in particular the identification of multi-stage vehicles but also to ensure higher data quality and more simplified data verification. Changes made to this method also result in a higher level of detail in the dataset.   ,new-vans-sold-in-europe  New vans sold in Europe are increasingly more fuel-efficient  The average van sold in the European Union in 2014 was around 2.4% more fuel-efficient than those sold in 2013, according to preliminary data from the European Environment Agency (EEA).

Water quality was excellent at 83 % of the sites, an increase of almost 1 percentage point compared to 2013.   All the bathing sites in Cyprus, Luxembourg, and Malta had excellent water quality. These countries were followed by Greece (97%), Croatia (94%) and Germany (90%), all having a high proportion of sites with excellent bathing water quality. Across Europe, just under 2% of bathing sites failed to meet the Bathing Water Directive’s minimum standards for water quality and were rated ‘poor’.   The results are from the  annual bathing water quality report  from the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Commission, which compares the quality of bathing water sampled at more than 21 000 coastal and inland bathing sites across the EU, Switzerland and Albania in 2014.

The highest numbers of bathing sites with poor water quality were found in Italy (107 bathing sites, 2%), France (105 bathing sites, 3%) and Spain (67 bathing sites, 3%).   In general, coastal beaches score high, with almost 97% of EU sites meeting the minimum standards and more than 85% rated as ‘excellent’. All coastal beaches in Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus were classified as having excellent bathing water quality.   In comparison, 91% of inland bathing waters (lakes and rivers) score at least minimum standards and more than 78% have excellent quality. In Luxembourg and Bulgaria, all inland bathing sites were rated excellent followed by Denmark where 95% of bathing water lakes had excellent quality.

"sharing-knowledge-on-climate-change-adaptation  Sharing knowledge on climate change adaptation  For all stakeholders, e.g. policymakers, cities, businesses, relevant and timely information is essential for developing and implementing strategies and measures to adapt to climate change. A new report by the European Environment Agency (EEA) provides an overview of existing information platforms across European countries.        According to the EEA's new technical report '   Overview of climate change adaptation platforms in Europe ', a  daptation platforms in European countries mostly include information on policy action at transnational, national and subnational levels, scientific research output, guidance, decision-support tools, experiences from practice and implemented adaptation measures.       Speaking at the second European Climate Change Adaptation Conference (ECCA), EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx said, 'Effective adaptation to climate change requires close cooperation between various stakeholders. Cities and businesses are implementing innovative solutions to adapt to climate change while also enhancing quality of life and protecting ecosystems'. Bruyninckx added, 'There is already a wealth of knowledge and experience available that should be shared, which can help all stakeholders to connect, be inspired and learn from each other. I believe new research programmes in the EU can further facilitate the co-creation of the knowledge base needed.'       In recent years, many European countries have established information platforms on climate change adaptation. Currently, there are 14 national adaptation platforms across EEA member countries   (Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) and two transnational platforms (the Alpine region and the Pyrenees). These are complemented by     Climate-ADAPT     – the European Climate Change Adaptation platform managed and maintained by the EEA in collaboration with the European Commission. In addition to country and European information, Climate-ADAPT also hosts a     section on the Baltic Sea region    . Of the 14 national adaptation platforms, seven are directly linked to the implementation of a national adaptation strategy or action plan.       The EEA report also analyses links between adaptation platforms and climate services and disaster risk reduction platforms. Adaptation measures cover in general long-term and gradual impacts of climate change (e.g. sea level rise) as well as disasters linked to extreme weather events intensified by climate change (e.g. flooding). A closer collaboration between climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction platforms can boost the use of available knowledge and contribute to reduce vulnerability.      In addition to presenting its new report and other findings on climate change, the EEA is organising two workshops on monitoring and evaluation of policies and on adaptation platforms, and participating in various sessions at the     ECCA conference    .      EEA and climate change adaptation     The EEA supports climate change adaptation through a series of assessments and by presenting its findings to various audiences including policy makers and the research community. In the last four years the EEA published assessment reports on the Alps; natural hazards; urban climate change adaptation; water resources and vulnerability; climate change impacts and vulnerability; initial adaptation actions; coasts; and national adaptation policies.    urban climate change adaptation adaptation platform disaster risk reduction,According to the EEA's new technical report 'Overview of climate change adaptation platforms in Europe', adaptation platforms in European countries mostly include information on policy action at transnational, national and subnational levels, scientific research output, guidance, decision-support tools, experiences from practice and implemented adaptation measures.

In addition to presenting its new report and other findings on climate change, the EEA is organising two workshops on monitoring and evaluation of policies and on adaptation platforms, and participating in various sessions at the ECCA conference.  EEA and climate change adaptation The EEA supports climate change adaptation through a series of assessments and by presenting its findings to various audiences including policy makers and the research community. In the last four years the EEA published assessment reports on the Alps; natural hazards; urban climate change adaptation; water resources and vulnerability; climate change impacts and vulnerability; initial adaptation actions; coasts; and national adaptation policies."
"ozone-pollution-in-europe-fewer  Ozone pollution in Europe: fewer alert days but concentrations still high  Air pollution by ground-level ozone continued to affect many countries across Europe during summer 2014, according to a new briefing published by the European Environment Agency (EEA). Almost all reporting countries exceeded at least once the long-term objective set by EU legislation, while the stricter alert threshold was exceeded only on four occasions.    Exposure to high concentrations of ground-level ozone can cause and aggravate cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The European Union's Air Quality Directive sets four standards to reduce air pollution by ozone and its impacts on health:       information threshold: 1-hour average ozone concentration of 180 μg/m 3 ,   alert threshold: 1-hour average ozone concentration of 240 μg/m 3 ,   long-term objective: the maximum daily 8-hour mean concentration of ozone should not exceed 120 μg/m 3 ,   target value: long-term objective should not be exceeded on more than 25 days per year, averaged over 3 years.             Concentrations of ground-level ozone significantly exceeded these standards during summer 2014, according to the     EEA's latest analysis    . However, the number of exceedances was lower than in many previous years, in line with the long-term downward trend observed over the last 25 years.      Depending on which threshold is exceeded, authorities in the affected areas and countries have to take specific measures. For example, exceeding the information threshold triggers an obligation to inform the population on possible risks, while exceeding the alert threshold requires authorities to take immediate action.      Key facts – summer ozone 2014      Measurements were reported from 1607 monitoring stations across 30 European countries.   Approximately 80% of these stations recorded at least one exceedance of the long-term objective between April to September 2014, with exceedances occurring in all reporting countries except Croatia, Estonia, Ireland, Romania and Serbia.   Seven EU Member States (Austria, Cyprus, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, and Spain) had stations where ozone levels exceeded the long-term objective on more than 25 days. This corresponds to 6% of all reporting stations, affecting approximately 1% of the total population in the reporting countries.   Averaged over the past three years, 16 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland) exceeded the 2012 target value.   Ozone concentrations higher than the information threshold were reported from monitoring stations in 18 countries. No exceedances were reported by Andorra, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and Sweden.   Ozone concentrations higher than the alert threshold were reported only in France, on four occasions.   Approximately 36% of the exceedances of the information threshold, 75% of exceedances of the alert threshold, and 20% of long-term objective exceedances took place during a single episode of high concentrations between 7 and 14 June 2014.          More detailed information on ozone measurements in each country as well as background information on ozone are available     in the briefing    .

Source: EEA     Main ozone episodes   An 'ozone episode' is defined as 'a period of usually a few days up to two to three weeks with high ozone concentrations, characterised by daily exceedances of the thresholds set to protect human health. Ozone episodes occur under specific meteorological conditions characterised by large stagnant areas of high pressure. Since the formation of ozone requires sunlight, ozone episodes mainly occur during summer.   Summer 2014 was characterised by very few exceedances with only several days with increased concentrations. One of these episodes occurred between 7 and 14 June, during which approximately 36% of the total number of exceedances of the information threshold, 75% of exceedances of the alert threshold, and 20% of LTO exceedances experienced during the summer took place.      About this assessment   Ozone (O  3  )is a 'secondary' pollutant formed from gases such as nitrogen oxides (NO  X  ) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of solar light. Ozone levels typically become particularly high in regions where considerable emissions of these gases combine with stagnant meteorological conditions,high levels of solar radiation and high temperaturesduring the summer. Summerreferstothe period from April to September.   Exposure to high O  3  concentrations can cause breathing problems, trigger asthma, reduce lung function and cause lung diseases.   Ozone is regulated under the Air Quality Directive (EU, 2008), which set some thresholds for ozone concentrations:     information threshold: 1-hour average ozone concentration of 180 g/m  3 ,    alert threshold: 1-hour average ozone concentration of 240 g/m  3  ,       long term objective (LTO): the maximum daily 8-hour mean concentration of ozone should not exceed 120 g/m  3  ,   target value (TV): LTO should not be exceeded on more than 25 days per calendar year, averaged over 3 years.     For description purposes a target value threshold (TVt) is also considered: LTO should not be exceeded on more than 25 days in a calendar year (instead of over the 3 year average).   Until 2014, Member States had to officially report on the summer ozone exceedances of these thresholds. Based on this past reporting, the European Environment Agency (EEA) has published annual Technical Reports analysing the summer ozone situation across Europe. After the entry into force of new EU rules for reporting air quality information (EU, 2011) a new system for reporting data was established. For the first time the analysis of the summer 2014 period was based on this new system. In total, 1 607 ozone-monitoring sites reported data; of these, 1 562 were located in EU Member States.,Key facts Exceedance of the information threshold  Ozone concentrations higher than the information threshold were reported from monitoring sites in 16 EU Member States and two non-member countries. No exceedances were reported from Andorra, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and Sweden in summer 2014. The information threshold was exceeded at approximately 9% of all stations providing data.

"building-a-shared-environmental-information  Building a shared environmental information system with Eastern neighbours  The European Union's eastern neighbours have achieved progress in developing systems for collecting environmental information, according to a recently published analysis. However, they need to strengthen further their capacities to be able to produce regular, policy-relevant and indicator-based state of the environment reports.    The synthesis report ' Building a Shared Environmental Information System with the Eastern Neighbourhood: Outcome of cooperation, 2010–2014'  (available in English and Russian) was developed together with the appointed representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine and financed by the  ENPI-SEIS project . Since 2010, the European Environment Agency (EEA) has been engaging the countries of the Eastern Partnership in regional cooperation in order to improve national capacities for managing and sharing environmental data and information.   Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: 'Pollution and climate change do not respect borders, their impact is felt by all of us. The EU and its neighbours need to address such challenges jointly, through open dialogue and sustained cooperation. The exchange of environmental information and best practices is crucial for promoting good environmental governance and sustainable development.'   The report provides a comprehensive overview of advancements made in all countries in building a Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS).

"a-europe-to-thrive-in  A Europe to thrive in  environment, health and well-being  The project on Foresighted Reasoning on Environmental Stressors and Health (FRESH) ran from 2013 to 2014 and investigated the frameworks and evidence base for undertaking integrated assessments of environmental health and well-being.   FRESH outputs are available here for download and include a  brochure that presents the conceptual approach used to frame project work and summarises the main conclusions, as well as a  narrative report  on how challenges and opportunities for the elderly population living in cities.   In addition, a number of leaflets address the intersection between health and key themes, including   transport  ,   housing  ,   climate change   and   chemicals in the human body  , and review available indicators under each theme. A   final leaflet   explores how the environmental and health nexus is captured in policies of the European Union (EU).     In the article below, we review how our understanding of the complex links between the environment, human health and well-being has evolved in recent years, and reflect on how this is addressed in the current EU policy framework. Conceptual models are available that can help us to structure our thinking and map available evidence to explore this relationship, as well as indicators that focus on the social and environmental dimensions of health and well-being.   A complex challenge    The health and well-being of human societies is intrinsically linked to the quality of the environment in which they live. Over the past century, evidence of the links between toxic, infectious and physical stressors in air, water, soil and food and negative health outcomes for local communities has accumulated. This has driven the implementation of targeted policy actions to address the environmental determinants of health.    This compartmentalised and hazard focused approach continues to deliver significant benefits for health. However, it is inadequate when tackling the multiple stressors and systemic challenges we face today, such as climate change, resource depletion and biodiversity loss. At the same time, our understanding of the human condition has been expanding to capture well-being, as well as health. When considering well-being in relation to the physical environment, it is important to address health stressors, and foster the positive aspects that make for a healthy and stimulating environment.   Recent framing of environment, health and well-being captures multiple and cumulative exposures, upstream drivers and feedback systems over expanded temporal and spatial scales. Health and well-being outcomes are now understood to be embedded in a wider social context, including demographic shifts towards an aging population, urbanisation, lifestyle and consumption changes, and shifts in the global disease burden from communicable to non-communicable disease. For example, shifts in demography and disease burden can increase vulnerability to environmental exposures, while urbanisation and increased consumption can amplify pressures on the environment and erode environmental quality.   These perspectives on the environment, health and well-being nexus aim to capture the dynamic relationships between our use of the environment as a resource, the pressures and resulting exposures that this generates, and resulting effects on human health and well-being. A key challenge in the field of environmental health is how to generate knowledge on these relationships that can inform the development of relevant policy responses.   In this article, we first consider how European Union (EU) policies reflect a more integrated understanding of the environment, health and well-being nexus. We go on to describe the most recent conceptual frameworks used to map these relationships, and identify relevant indicator frameworks. We conclude with some reflections on how frameworks on environment, health and well-being might inform future policy making.   Changing political perspectives   The focus of EU policies on environment and health has shifted from a compartmentalised approach towards a systemic approach that captures the interdependencies across environment, health and well-being challenges.   The Europe 2020 strategy (EC, 2010), the 7th Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) (EU, 2013) and the Roadmap to a Resource-Efficient Europe (EC, 2011) are the EU policy documents that set strategic objectives for the period up until 2020 and longer-term visions up until 2050.   The 7th EAP explicitly focuses on improving environmental quality in order to reap benefits for health and well-being, recognising the need to maintain the capacity of ecosystems to deliver key services essential to human society.   Europe 2020, the EUs growth strategy for the period 2010 to 2020, presents a vision of a sustainable and inclusive economy, characterised by high levels of employment, productivity and social cohesion. It explicitly acknowledges the need to create synergies between economic and environmental goals, and argues for a transition towards a 'green economy'. The flagship initiative 'Resource Efficient Europe' contains elements relevant to environment and health, where 'by 2050 the EU's economy has grown in a way that respects resource constraints and planetary boundaries, thus contributing to a global economic transformation'.   The European Environment and Health Strategy (EC, 2003) took an integrated approach aiming to create synergies between health, environment and research policies. The 20042010 Environment and Health Action Plan (EC, 2004) aimed to implement the first cycle of the strategy and focused on the causal links between environmental risk factors and priority diseases.   Effective governance of the environment, human health and well-being reaches across a number of policy domains and must be grounded in an understanding of complex system interactions, feedback loops, and the trade-offs involved. With the aim of facilitating understanding of these systemic risks and interactions, new conceptual frameworks have been developed. The aim is to take an integrated approach to assessing the relationships between environmental factors and human health that can capture the broader spatial, socio-economic and cultural context.   Conceptual approaches   In the field of environmental health, recent efforts have focused on the development of frameworks that can depict the multiple variables at work within the environment, health and well-being nexus and illustrate the causal relationships between them. In particular, the aim has been to capture how drivers catalyse the transition of an environmental state, leading to an exposure that in turn generates a health outcome. The relationship is conceived as bi-directional, whereby high quality environments provide positive impacts on health and well-being. An additional aim is to acknowledge how an individuals socio-economic context can determine the relationship between exposure and resulting health impacts.   In a parallel development, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) called for by UN SecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan aimed to assess the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being and establish the scientific basis for action needed to enhance the conservation and sustainable use of those systems. Work undertaken in this context by the MA Board (MA Board, 2005) recognised the need to place well-being in an ecosystem perspective. Their aim was to capture the dynamic relationships between the ecosystem services provided by natural capital and the key constituents of human well-being.   These insights then informed the development of a more recent conceptual model in this field, the Ecosystems Enriched Drivers, Pressures, State, Exposure, Effect, Actions or eDPSEEA model (Reis et al 2013). The distal DPSEEA model presented in figure 1 below, is derived from the eDPSEEA model and depicts a spatially distal pathway from drivers to the pressures which disrupt ecosystem services and by extension human health and wellbeing.   Figure 1: The distal DPSEEA model that captures the ecological complexity on environment, health and well-being (EHWB)        Source: Adapted from the Ecosystems Enriched (eDPSEEA model (Reis et al, 2013)     The model recognises this distal pathway through which drivers can influence health and well-being in any location, in addition to the proximal (near in space and time) pathway which is normally considered in environmental public health.   The proximal pathway captures the traditional perspective whereby changes to the local physical environment impact on health and well-being, an example being the effects of contaminated drinking water on the local population.   The second, distal pathway, illustrated above shows how drivers can influence health and well-being through their impact on ecosystems services in remote locations. For example, the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the global climatic system and resulting climatic disruption at the local level. An important recognition is that, irrespective of where ecosystem damage initially impacts, in a world intimately connected by social, economic and ecological systems, the effects on health and well-being may be felt anywhere, for example through migration or damage to food security.   This conceptual model is attractive since it integrates social complexity with ecological complexity in the relationship between environment, health and well-being over different scales, as well as capturing the positive concept of well-being.   Indicator frameworks   Conceptual frameworks are very useful tools for depicting relationships in systems, but if they are to aid our understanding of the current situation or possible future scenarios, then the relevant parts must be furnished with concrete evidence. Indicators provide a means of organising data on interactions in the system and tracking and communicating trends over space and time.   Traditional economic indicators such as GDP have been criticised for failing to capture important issues which affect human well-being, for example, the state of the environment and the sustainability of economic development. Substantial efforts have been made to develop indicators that address the wider social, health and environmental dimensions of well-being, including the OECDs Better Life Initiative; the New Economics Foundations system of National Accounts of Well-being; the University of Waterloos Canadian Index of Well-Being; and Eurostats Quality of life indicators.   The use of natural resources to meet basic needs is also the subject of the Environmental Indicator Report on Natural Resources and Human Well-being in a Green Economy (EEA, 2013). The report takes basic needs as an entry point to resource use, illustrating the complex interdependence of Europes systems for meeting its food, water, energy and housing needs (see figure 2 below). The report proposes a suit of indicators that provide insight into resource use patterns and how they impact on the environment and ultimately on human well-being. Although the environmental pressures related to resource use are generally in decline, diverse impacts on human well-being persist due to time lags before improvements in the state of the environment manifest.   Figure 2: Key resource systems and human well-being       Source: EEA, 2013, Environmental indicator report 2013  Natural resources and human well-being in a green economy.   Tracking multifaceted impacts on health and well-being demands a diverse set of indicators. In developing an indicator base for environment, health and well-being, it is also important to include indicators that combine health, environment and socio-economic dimensions.   In figure 3 below, we take the example of climate change to demonstrate how conceptual mapping can help us to understand the complex relationships between ecosystems, natural, built and social environments, and human health. By identifying the pressures that impact on the state of the environment and determining human exposures and experiences, via both distal and proximal pathways, we can then start to build a portfolio of relevant policy actions.   Figure 3: Addressing the effects and actions of climate change through DPSEEA models       Source: The modelling approach used in this graphic is based on the eDPSEEA model derived from Reis et al. (2013) which shows both the proximal and distal (ecosystems related) pathways from anthropogenic drivers to health and wellbeing.   The mapping process enables us to identify indicators that can be used to monitor change at different points in the system, including drivers, pressures, states, exposures, effects and actions. Figure 4 below provides an overview of possible indicators on effects of climate change on the environment and human health, and identifies international data sources that can inform these indicators.   Figure 4: Selected indicators on the effects of climate change on the environment and human health       Looking Forward   Conceptual frameworks can provide tools to think with, allowing us to communicate and bridge gaps across scientific, professional and policy constituencies. The eDPSEEA-model described above permits the broader framing of environment, health and well-being, against which to assemble a diverse array of evidence in a meaningful structure that can provide insights for policy making.   In addition, the framework allows us to configure a set of assessment indicators which reflect the social and ecological complexity of environment, health and well-being and can be used to track the effectiveness of policy, the interactions between several policy measures and unintended health consequences of policies. A challenge remains in terms of the availability of data with which to furnish indicators in the environment, health and well-being nexus. Relevant data are in some cases available from international or national data sources, but spatial and temporal coverage is fragmented. The further development of an indicator system for environment, health and well-being should be coupled with improvements in the evidence base in order to effectively inform future policy initiatives.

"new-cars2019-co2-emissions-well  New cars’ CO2 emissions well below Europe’s 2015 target  New cars sold in 2014 emit on average 2.6 % less CO2 than those sold in 2013 and almost 7 grammes of CO2/km below the 2015 target, according to provisional data published today by the European Environment Agency.    The average emissions level of a new car sold in 2014 was 123.4 grammes of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) per kilometre, significantly below the 2015 target of 130 g, according to  provisional data  from the European Environment Agency (EEA). Since monitoring started under current legislation in 2010, emissions have decreased by 17 g CO 2 /km (12 %). Manufacturers will, nevertheless, have to further reduce emissions to meet the target of 95 g CO 2 /km by 2021.   Key findings       A total of 12.5 million new cars were registered in 2014, the first overall increase since 2007. Registrations increased in all EU Member States compared to 2013, except for Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands.   A new car sold in 2014 emitted on average 123.4 grammes of g CO 2 /km, significantly below the 2015 target of 130 g CO 2 /km. Europe had already reached its 2015 target by 2013, two years ahead of schedule.   Average emissions levels in 2014 were below 130 g CO 2 /km in 17 of the 28 Member States.   Significantly more efficient models were bought in the pre-2004 EU Member States compared to the newer EU Member States. The most efficient cars were bought in the Netherlands (107 g CO 2 /km), Greece (108 g CO 2 /km) and Portugal (109 g CO 2 /km), while the least efficient cars were bought in Estonia (141 g CO 2 /km), followed by Latvia (140 g CO 2 /km) and Bulgaria (136 g CO 2 /km).   Diesel vehicles remain the most sold vehicles in Europe, constituting 53 % of sales. Countries with high proportions of diesel sales include Ireland (74 %), Luxembourg (72 %), Portugal (71 %), Spain (66 %), France and Greece (64 %), Croatia (63 %) and Belgium (62 %).   Despite minor fluctuations in the past, the fuel efficiency of petrol cars has been catching up with that of the more fuel-efficient diesel cars in recent years. The average emissions gap between petrol and diesel is currently below 3 g CO 2 /km, around one seventh of the gap in 2000.   Around 38 000 electric vehicles were registered in 2014, up by 57 % compared to 2013. The largest number of registrations was recorded in France (more than 10 700 vehicles), Germany (around 8 500 vehicles) and the UK (around 6 700 vehicles). Nevertheless, electric vehicles continue to constitute only a very small fraction of new registrations (0.3 %).          EEA activities   In accordance with EU Regulation (EC) No 443/2009, the EEA collects  data on all passenger vehicles registered in Europe  and makes it available online. The data collected includes information on CO 2  emissions and vehicle mass. It is reported by all Member States in order to evaluate the performance of the new vehicle fleet towards the 2015 CO 2  emissions target (130 g CO 2 /km).   Type approval test procedure   Member States report new vehicles’ CO 2  emission levels, calculated on the basis of a  standardised driving cycle . This cycle allows a comparison of emissions by manufacturers, but it does not necessarily represent real-world driving conditions. Later this year, the EEA plans to publish a separate report highlighting the key reasons for the growing differences observed between official and real world driving emissions.   Next steps   While the average target for the collective EU fleet has been met ahead of the deadline, it has not yet been confirmed whether different manufacturers have met their own specific annual targets, based on the average mass of the cars they sell. The EEA will publish the final data on manufacturers’ individual performances in the autumn.   fuel efficiency co2 emissions car ghg emissions diesel electric cars,The average emissions level of a new car sold in 2014 was 123.4 grammes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilometre, significantly below the 2015 target of 130 g, according to provisional data from the European Environment Agency (EEA).

"assessment  Sites designated under the EU Habitats and Birds Directives   Since 2002, there has been a steady increase in the cumulative area of the Natura 2000 network. Sites of Community Importance (SCIs) increased in coverage from 450 000 to 810 000 square kilometres and Special Protected Areas (SPAs) increased from approximately 180 000 to 670 000 square kilometres. Ten countries have designated more than 20% of their territory.   habitats protected areas biodiversity species natura2000     SEBI SEBI008 008,Under the Habitats Directive, each Member State shall contribute to the creation of Natura 2000 by designating sites in proportion to the natural habitat types and habitats of species of European interest represented within its territory. At EU-28 level, around 13% of the terrestrial territory is designated under the Birds Directive, whileunder the Habitats Directive the figure is around 14%. Many sites are designated under both directives and 18% of the terrestrial territory is designated for both. Since 2002, there has been a steady increase in the cumulative area of the Natura 2000 network. Sites of Community Importance (SCIs) increased in coverage from 450 000 to 810 000 square kilometres and Special Protected Areas (SPAs) increased from approximately 180 000 to 670 000 square kilometres (Figures 1 and 2). These increases occurred due to the fact that 10 new countries joined the EU in 2004, followed by Bulgaria and Romania in 2007 and Croatia in 2013. A better designation of marine areas also explained this trend (251 000 square kilometres in 2013). Another factor was new designations of protected areas made by the Member States, particularly under the Birds Directive. As of December 2013, ten Member States had designated more than 20% of their territory as Natura 2000 sites: Slovenia (37.9%); Croatia (36.5%); Bulgaria (34.3%); Slovakia (29.6%); Cyprus (28.4%); Spain (27.2%); Greece (27.1%); Romania (22.6%); Hungary (21.4%); and Portugal (20.6%) (EC, 2014).

"ecological-footprint-of-european-countries-2  Ecological footprint of European countries   The total ecological footprint for the EU-28 countries increased rapidly during the 1960s and 70s, and has remained relatively constant since the 1980s. The regions total biocapacity, however, has changed very little since 1961. The picture is similar for the EEA-33 countries.   The pan-European ecological footprint has been increasing almost constantly since 1961, while biocapacity  (1)   has decreased. This results in an ever larger deficit, with negative consequences for the environment within and outside Europe.          (1)     The capacity of ecosystems to produce useful biological materials and to absorb waste materials generated by humans, using current management schemes and extraction technologies.     biodiversity ecological footprint  SEBI SEBI023 023,Europes ecological deficit[1] is considerable; its total demand for ecological goods and services exceeds what its own ecosystems supply. The EU-28 regions footprint is over twice the size of its biocapacity; the same is true for the EEA-33. If everyone on the planet had the same ecological footprint as the average resident of the EU-28, we would need approximately 2.6 Earths to support our demands on nature. The pan-European ecological deficit per person is significantly smaller, as shown in Figure 1. Nations can operate with an ecological deficit in three ways: by drawing down their own stocks of ecological capital; by importing products and thus using the biocapacity of other nations; or by exploiting the global commons, such as by releasing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning into the atmosphere. Some nations overdraw their own biocapacity for export while simultaneously importing additional biocapacity from elsewhere. On a global scale, all nations cannot be net importers, and nations that rely on competition for increasingly scarce imports will be increasingly at risk. In a world that is already in overshoot, Europes ecological deficit can have major environmental implications, including degradation of ecological assets, depletion of natural reserves, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse. While the footprint does not measure biodiversity loss directly, it tracks global pressures on biodiversity and can be used to complement other measures of ecosystem-specific impacts on biodiversity (Galli et al., 2014). Figure 4 shows that Europe is not the only region where the ecological footprint exceeds biocapacity; North America, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East/Central Asia regions also have ecological deficits. On the other hand, Europe beyond the EU has a biocapacity that is slightly larger than its Footprint.   [1] Ecological deficit (or reserve) refers to the difference between the biocapacity and the ecological footprint of a region or country. An ecological deficit occurs when the footprint of a population exceeds the biocapacity of the area available to that population. Conversely, an ecological reserve exists when the biocapacity of a region exceeds its populations footprint. At the global level, the ecological deficit is equivalent to global overshoot.

"marine-litterwatch-in-a-nutshell  Marine LitterWatch in a nutshell  Litter, plastics in particular, is accumulating in our seas and coasts. Information and data on marine litter is essential for tackling it. The European Environment Agency has developed Marine LitterWatch to strengthen Europe’s knowledge base and thus provide support to European policy making.   WHAT AND WHY   Litter, accumulating in our seas and coasts is impacting marine ecosystems, causing problems to human activities that use and depend on the sea and raising human health concerns. European Member States are developing measures to tackle marine litter with the Marine Strategy Framework Directive but the information base is still insufficient. Marine LitterWatch aims to empower citizen communities to provide relevant data while creating more awareness at the local level on marine litter.   The European Environment Agency developed Marine LitterWatch, which combines citizen engagement and modern technology to help tackle marine litter. Marine LitterWatch offers tools – a mobile app, a web portal and a public database - to collect and share comparable data on marine litter on beaches. It also provides a platform for marine litter communities to come together, share their knowledge and co-create approaches to monitoring marine litter.   The Marine LitterWatch mobile app is available for Android & iPhone devices. Minimum standards recommended are 3G mobile network; iOS 7.0 or later (iPhone 4 or newer); Android v.3.0 (from 2012 onwards). The app can be downloaded free of charge from the Google Play Store and App Store.   WHERE   Marine LitterWatch was designed to support data collection events on beaches and other stretches of coast. Although litter at sea or in rivers is crucial to monitor, Marine LitterWatch doesn´t currently support such activities.   HOW   Marine LitterWatch builds on three key elements: organised groups (the 'communities'), a mobile application, and a database. Communities organize either clean-up or monitoring events on beaches and make surveys with the mobile app to report on litter items found. A  web portal  is also available for the communities to more easily manage their events and data. The app uses a European harmonized list of items agreed within the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The data is available through EEA´s website.   WHO   The EEA is working together with many existing communities working on marine litter from all regional seas in Europe. Marine LitterWatch also aims to inspire new communities to form. These can range from NGOs, business and industry, coastal communities (e.g. local sports club, scouts), schools and universities, expert communities (i.e. science and research) to public authorities and other.

"european-citizens-to-help-tackle  European citizens to help tackle marine litter  Litter, plastics in particular, is accumulating in our seas and coasts mainly due to current unsustainable consumption and production patterns, poor waste management and the lack of public awareness. Marine litter is an increasing threat to the marine environment, to human health and our well-being. It has cross border impacts on wildlife and habitats. Without tackling marine litter, Europe cannot have healthy seas.    The European Union is addressing the problem of marine litter through the     Marine Strategy Framework Directive     (MSFD), which requires Member States to monitor the state of our seas and take the measures needed to reach or maintain its ‘good environmental status’ by 2020.  However, legislation alone cannot solve this problem. We all contribute to and are affected by marine litter. It is therefore crucial to engage citizens to better understand, prevent and reduce it.    Although we can see that marine litter is a growing concern, EU Member States need more data to properly assess the extent of the problem. In this respect, citizens can play a major role in collecting data and information needed to support authorities to better manage and prevent marine litter.   Active participation in data collection activities can also help raise awareness among citizens and communities of environmental issues prevailing in their local area. This awareness is key to help induce sustainable practices and behaviour.   With these concerns in mind, namely filling data gaps and facilitating citizens’ engagement in environmental issues - marine litter in this case, the European Environment Agency (EEA) has developed Marine LitterWatch (MLW). MLW combines citizen engagement with modern technology to help tackle the problem of marine litter.   Marine LitterWatch: collecting beach litter data   MLW aims to collect data on marine litter on beaches relevant for the MSFD to support official monitoring, with the help of interested citizens and communities. It also allows the collection of data from non-official initiatives such as clean-ups.   MLW builds on the    MSFD monitoring guidelines    developed by the Technical Group on Marine Litter, a group of experts established to support the MSFD implementation. MLW depends on three key elements: organised citizen groups (the 'communities'), a mobile application and a database. Items found on the beach can be reported through surveys made with MLW app. With time, the data collected by the public should improve the understanding of marine litter distribution and composition, and thus help tackle marine litter better. See the illustration below showing the MLW concept.       Empowering communities   Many citizens and communities (NGOs, civil society initiatives) across the EU are already taking part in activities to tackle marine litter. MLW aims to enable them to participate in a European attempt to address marine litter issues. MLW also aims to inspire new communities to form. The aim is to empower citizen networks throughout Europe with MLW and help improve the evidence base needed to reach the MSFD main objective of 'Good Environmental Status' of Europe´s seas by 2020.      More information on how to use Marine LitterWatch.        MLW has been developed by the EEA in collaboration with the   Marine Conservation Society  , the   Institute for Water of the Republic of Slovenia  , the    North Sea Foundation    and the   PERSEUS   FP7 research project.

"europe-shouldnt-be-afraid-of  Europe shouldn't be afraid of leading the world on environmental regulation  Over the past 40 years Europe has developed the most comprehensive, ambitious and binding environmental legislation existing anywhere today. And with good reason: these standards should be seen as a unique economic advantage.   Well-designed and well-implemented environmental legislation has improved the environment and quality of life, as well as driving innovation, job creation and growth in Europe. This is one of the main messages to come out of the latest edition of ‘ The European environment – state and outlook ’ (SOER 2015) report we published this month.    Coming at a time when Europe is still growing out of the economic crisis, and debating where to spend scarce resources to stimulate the economy, SOER 2015 illustrates that investing in strong environmental standards is the right choice.   In many parts of Europe, the local environment is arguably in as good a state today as it has been since the start of industrialisation. We breathe cleaner air and enjoy cleaner water. Almost a fifth of Europe’s land is now protected. Industrial pollution has decreased, we use material resources and energy more efficiently, and recycling rates are up. Since 1990, the European Union cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 20%, while the economy grew by more than 45%.   Apart from a better environment, there is also a solid economic case for strong environmental standards. The European environmental goods and services sector grew by more than 50% in size between 2000 and 2011. It has also been one of the few economic sectors that has flourished since the 2008 financial crisis, adding about 1.3 million jobs, generating export earnings and contributing to Europe’s economic competitiveness.   There are also clear indirect economic benefits, such as savings in healthcare costs and more productive ecosystems. Of course there might be a cost to business, but as environmental regulation often emphasises energy and resource efficiency, such standards may help to insulate businesses from two of the vulnerabilities of European industries and economies: large natural resource and energy dependencies, which represent a significant portion of the average production cost.   There are other strong reasons why businesses should be moving fast to reduce environmental impacts. The most recent  World Economic Forum report  on global risks to business also emphasises that the top risks for the next decade are less economic and more environmental, related especially to climate change impacts, water crises, the quality of biodiversity and ecosystems, and human-made environmental catastrophes. While many of these risks are global, Europe can have a strong negotiating position on these issues through its already credible and effective policy frameworks and processes.   Europe’s niche   The EU has given a strong signal that environmental protection will guide its economic development and prosperity over this century in its  7th Environment Action Programme  ‘Living well within the limits of our planet’. In little more than a generation, this means a fundamental decarbonisation of the economy, stepping away from our linear mine-produce-use-throw-away model of production and consumption, protecting natural systems, and taking environmental health issues more seriously when decisions are made.   This will require fundamental changes in the systems of production and consumption that are the root cause of environmental problems - energy, food, transport, buildings and so on.   Such changes will mean that we will have to overcome the way we are locked in to unsustainable systems, for example with infrastructure that dictates the way we travel or produce and distribute food and energy.   To grasp the challenge of 2050, our report shows that public and private investments will need to be better focused towards a low carbon and circular economy. This will also require serious rethinking of systems, which directly or indirectly influence the choices made: finance and investment systems, tax and subsidy systems, R&D; choices, and education. These changes will naturally have big implications and create opportunities for business.   Based on our report, we think Europe should feel confident about the future. Nowhere else on the planet have 28 countries agreed to such ambitious binding legislation, in areas ranging from hazardous chemicals to water quality, from greenhouse gases to waste management. And as environmental issues become more pressing around the world, this is one area where Europe can lead.   The ambition of a low carbon and circular economy, which improves people’s wellbeing, is creating real opportunities. Europe’s place in the world is changing, with less than 10% of the global population and major economic players rising in other parts of the world. But in this changing world, environmental innovation can become Europe’s niche.   This will require the courage and political will to move beyond the 20 th  century and fully embrace the challenge of the 21 st  century, of living well and within the limits of our planet.        Hans BRUYNINCKX   Executive Director   Editorial published in the issue no. 2015/1 of the EEA newsletter, March 2015   7th environmental action programme green economy soer2015,Well-designed and well-implemented environmental legislation has improved the environment and quality of life, as well as driving innovation, job creation and growth in Europe.

And as environmental issues become more pressing around the world, this is one area where Europe can lead. The ambition of a low carbon and circular economy, which improves people’s wellbeing, is creating real opportunities. Europe’s place in the world is changing, with less than 10% of the global population and major economic players rising in other parts of the world. But in this changing world, environmental innovation can become Europe’s niche. This will require the courage and political will to move beyond the 20th century and fully embrace the challenge of the 21st century, of living well and within the limits of our planet.   Hans BRUYNINCKX Executive Director Editorial published in the issue no. 2015/1 of the EEA newsletter, March 2015"
"when-plastics-fill-our-oceans  When plastics fill our oceans  Our consumption and production patterns generate waste, a part of which ends up as litter in our oceans. Why is preventing marine litter important for the environment and the health of our seas in particular? What is Europe doing to prevent marine litter? We asked these questions to Constança Belchior, who works on marine assessments and impacts of marine litter at the European Environment Agency.   What is marine litter? How does it impact the environment?   Marine litter is the term used for solid particles of ‘waste’ found in our seas. It includes a wide range of items, such as plastic bags, PET bottles, cigarette butts, abandoned fishing gear, metal pieces, treated wood and glass. The large majority is plastic coming from land-based activities that find its way to the oceans.   Many marine species can get entangled in larger pieces of marine litter and can be injured and die from it. They can also mistake it for food and swallow it. Many sea birds, mammals and other animals are found with plastic in their stomachs, preventing them from digesting normal food.   With time, plastic items fragment into smaller pieces, some of which cannot be seen with the naked eye. Microplastics can be ingested by a wider range of smaller animals, affecting marine food-webs. Research shows that these microplastics can also attract toxic chemical pollutants to their surface, harming further the animals that ingest them. Although the links between human health and plastics entering the food chain need to be explored further, a significant share of our caloric intake comes from the sea. It could represent a risk on human health.   Marine litter is also an economic loss for coastal communities and the economic sectors dependent on the sea. A beach full of litter is understandably not very appealing to visitors.     How much litter is there?   Recent studies bring more clarity on the magnitude of the problem. According to  one estimate , 2 to 5% of the plastic generated in the world entered the world’s oceans in 2010. This corresponds to approximately five plastic bags completely filled with plastics for every 30 cm of coastline around the world. According to another  estimate , more than 5 trillion pieces are floating in the world’s oceans. Only a negligible share of marine litter is recovered, mainly through beach clean ups. The rest accumulates in our seas.   And plastic particles are everywhere. I have recently sailed across the northeast Atlantic and we did random trawling for marine litter throughout the expedition. No matter how far we were from the coast, our samples had plastics along with small marine organisms every single time. The world´s oceans and seas are connected. This makes marine litter a global problem.   How can we tackle marine litter?   The short answer is that we need to prevent it from getting into the water in the first place; so tackling it at its source is essential. This means implementing better waste management on land, which builds on our growing knowledge about marine litter. However, waste management will not suffice. We need systemic and integrated solutions.   Our recently published report ‘ The European environment – state and outlook 2015 ’ emphasises the need for more systemic and better integrated approaches to environmental problems. In this context, tackling marine litter also asks for changes to our consumption and production patterns, and which might ultimately imply changes in some daily habits and lifestyles. For example, in the case of plastic bags, we should be asking whether we need them all or if we can replace some uses with alternatives instead. Moreover, for the plastic bags and products we need or want, we have to produce them in a way we minimise their impact on the marine environment, namely by factoring in how we can reuse and recycle them better.   Unfortunately, even if Europe succeeds reducing and halting litter from entering the oceans, the marine litter problem will persist as long as efforts at regional and global level are not better coordinated and complementing each other. We also have to accept that our oceans are never going to be fully free of waste. Cleaning up what has been accumulating seems unrealistic, especially given that oceans cover almost three quarters of Earth’s surface. Moreover, there is no easy way of deciding who is responsible for marine litter and who should pay for cleaning it up. I personally believe that we have enough knowledge, technology and human innovation to reconcile with our past mistakes and create a new chapter for the oceans.   What is the European Union doing to tackle marine litter?   The key piece of legislation for the marine environment is the  Marine Strategy Framework Directive . The directive aims at ensuring the protection and sustainable use of marine ecosystems in Europe’s regional seas by achieving a good environmental status by 2020. In this context, it is also the first legal instrument to that requires European Member-States to set environmental targets, monitor and implement measures to tackle marine litter.   Although marine litter is a growing environmental problem, the information base on it is still limited. The marine directive clearly requires EU Member States to monitor marine litter, which means that they need to set up data collection mechanisms and be able to report their progress towards achieving the set targets. By doing so, the directive also supports one of the objectives of the EU’s 7 th   Environment Action Programme , namely of combating pollution and establishing a measureable reduction target for the amount of litter entering the seas by 2020.   The EU has also various pieces of legislation on waste. A recent review process of the waste legislation has produced, among others, an assessment of the impact that dedicated policy measures for specific litter items could have on marine litter.   Other actors are also taking important measures. For example, several Regional Sea Conventions, including in the Mediterranean, the Baltic and the North-East Atlantic, are working on implementing regional actions plans for that purpose.   These efforts are best seen in the broader policy context of building a truly circular economy and of achieving long-term sustainability in Europe.   What does the EEA do on marine litter?   The European Environment Agency is a knowledge institution. We compile data from our member countries, analyse them and assess various aspects of the environment. We then use this knowledge to support European policy processes to help improve Europe´s environment.   More concretely, we are producing assessments on the marine environment, including the two briefings in SOER 2015 ( marine environment  and  maritime activities ). In coming months, we will publish a report on the state of Europe’s seas, also looking at the pressures on marine ecosystems including marine litter. We have also developed ‘ Marine LitterWatch ’ – an app and a web portal to help communities monitor the litter found on beaches and share the data. Many citizens take part in clean-up activities across Europe, and we want to help these communities collect marine litter data that can be used for designing more effective policies, including the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

"assessment  Emission intensity of manufacturing industries in Europe    The manufacturingindustryin 11 countries (Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden) has achieved absolute decoupling of nutrient emissions from economic growth (GVA). A decrease in emissions coupled with a decrease in gross value added (GVA) occurred in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Belgium and Finland. However, in all cases (except Finland), the rate of emissions decrease was greater than that of GVA. An increase in nutrient emissions, accompanying the growth in GVA, was observed in Slovakia and Poland.     These developments arise from different absolute levels of emissions intensities and depend on there being no major changes in data coverage -  such as including more facilities in the most recent reporting year despite them already existing in the earliest reporting year   - within the countries  during the reporting period. It should be noted that, as some industrial emissions may vary considerably from year to year, the comparison of just two selected years might be subject to variations, and not be representative of a consistent trend.     The achievement of absolute decoupling of manufacturing industries' heavy metals emissions from economic growth (GVA) was observed again in 12 countries (Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden). A decrease in emissions, coupled with a decrease in GVA occurred in the United Kingdom, Italy and Belgium. In all cases, the decrease in the rate of emissions was greater than that of GVA (relative decoupling). An increase in emissions, despite a drop in GVA, was observed in Finland and France.Finally, a growth in emissions accompanying economic growth occurred in the manufacturing industry in Hungary.      Given the multiple factors that affect both sectoral GVA and the pollution pressure originating from manufacturing, it is complicated to draw direct relationships between these two variables. Some key descriptors, which could aid in explaining this behaviour, are the structure of the sector (e.g. facility size distribution, production technology, relative proportion reported as E-PRTR releases), the socioeconomic characteristics (e.g. salary levels) of the area and the policy and/or economic measures in place (e.g. treatment requirements, pollution charges, taxes). However, it must be noted that the specific context of each country could result in varying combinations of the factors  mentioned  and their aggregate effects.    total organic carbon industrial waste water chemical industry ndustry metal industry food nutrients industry food industry emission heavy metals water emission intensity organic pollutant heavy metal metaindustry                WREI WREI003 003,Values of the total nutrient emission intensity of food industries in Europe range from 0.24 to 34.4 kg of nutrient equivalent/million EURO GVA. The average 2009 value is 7 kg of nutrient equivalent/million EURO GVA. Emission intensity values for the food industry in Norway, United Kingdom and Belgium exceeded 10 kg of nutrient equivalent/million EURO GVA and were the highest in Europe. Significant differences in total emission values (ranging from 9 620 to 878203 kg) between large food industries (e.g. in United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, France, Italy and United Kingdom) belonging to the same GVA range (i.e. above 25000 million EURO), indicate a different level in the implementation of the UWWTD (relevant for food industry) and possibly a different level of pollution abatement and eco-innovation . Absolute decoupling of nutrient emissions from GVA was observed in Norway, Italy, Sweden, Portugal and the Netherlands. Relative decoupling was achieved in France, Hungary and the United Kingdom. A significant increase in emissions along with economic growth was observed in Spain.,The range of emission intensity values for heavy metals and nutrients vary considerably across Europe. This reflects the different facility size distributions in different countries and the degree to which the reported releases to water in E-PRTR dominate emissions, since all facilities in the sector are included in the GVA. The range also reflects transfers via urban wastewater treatment plants, which are not included in the indicator values. Therefore, it is not advisable to draw conclusions from the EU wide comparison of the absolute emission intensity values, but rather focus on the assessment of national trends in emissions intensity. The lowest value of nutrient emission intensity for 2012 is 0.39 kg nutrients equivalent/million EURO GVA, while the highest value is 23.82 kg nutrients equivalent/million EURO GVA. The average 2012 nutrient emission intensity is about 8.5 kg nutrients equivalent/million EURO GVA. When compared to the last assessment, based on 2010 data, the range of emission intensities narrowed significantly, however, the average values, based on 2010 and 2012, do not differ too much. All assessed countries (except Iceland) fall in the 95% percentile (i.e. 18 million EURO GVA) of emission intensity. Relatively low values (< 5 kg nutrients equivalent/million EURO GVA were observed for Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania and Romania. Similarly 2012 emission intensity values for heavy metals range between 1.18x10-5 and 0.022 kg heavy metals equivalent (mercury)/million EURO GVA. The average 2012 heavy metals emission intensity is 0.008 kg heavy metals equivalent (mercury)/million EURO GVA. The highest values (> 0.01 kg heavy metals equivalent (mercury)/million EURO GVA) were recorded for Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, whereas the lowest values (smaller by two orders of magnitude) were calculated for Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Slovenia. A decrease in the emission intensity of nutrients occurred in 20 out of 23 countries assessed over the period 2004-2012. Heavy metals emission intensity decreased in 17 out of 24 countries assessed over the same period. A wide variety of emission intensity across Europe could be explained by different levels of implementation and enforcement of EU policy regarding emissions to water (reflected in the number of facilities reported over the period 2004-2012), by different levels of the eco-innovations and economic incentives applied in the manufacturing sector across Europe, and also by country differences regarding the main manufacturing sectors contributing to the country's economy.,Values of heavy metals emission intensity for metal processing industries in Europe range from 5.48*10-4 to 0.16 kg of heavy metals equivalent (mercury)/million EURO GVA. The average 2012 value is 0.024 kg of heavy metals equivalent (mercury)/million EURO GVA. The highest emission intensity values calculated for 2012 were found in Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania. Emission values of the countries falling into the same range of GVA for the metal industry as Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary are much lower than values in these countries. Absolute decoupling of heavy metals equivalent emissions from GVA was achieved in 10 of the 17 countries assessed (Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Slovenia and Slovakia). Relative decoupling was observed in Belgium, Spain, Italy and France. Growth of emissions along with economic growth was found in Hungary.,Values of the total organic carbon (TOC) emission intensity of chemical industries in Europe range from 85 to 5041 kg TOC/million EURO GVA. The average 2012 value is 872 kg TOC/million EURO GVA. The emission intensity values decreased since 2004 in 14 out of 17 assessed countries. The highest values of emission intensityfor 2012 were observed in Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania, however, in Romania and Slovakia the TOC emission load has shown a downward trend since 2004. The GVA for the chemical industry in Romania, and especially Bulgaria and Slovakia, belong to the lowest in the EU over the last decade and reflect problems such as an inability to compete due to a lack of financial resources, increased prices of raw materials, ecological requirements, expensive bank loans, leading to the closure of a great number of chemical enterprises. Absolute decoupling of TOC emissions from GVA was observed in 10 of the 17 countries assessed (Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Finland, France, Hungary, Netherlands, Portugal Slovakia and Spain).On the other hand, a growth in emissions along with economic growth was observed for the chemical industry in Austria and Poland."
"assessment  Pathways of introduction of marine non-indigenous species   The main pathways for marine non-indigenous species (NIS) introduction in Europes seas are shipping (51%) and the Suez Canal (37%). These are followed by aquaculture related activities (17%) and, to a much lesser extent, aquarium trade (3%) and inland canals (2%).This is a pattern observed in all regional seas, except for the Eastern Mediterranean where introductions via the Suez Canal exceed those by shipping.   Trends in pathways show an increasing rate of introductions by shipping and corridors (in particular the Suez canal) since the 1990s, while aquaculture mediated introductions have been decreasing since the 2000s. This can be attributed to the adoption of effective EU regulation. Aquarium trade emerges as a lower but increasing pathway since the 2000s.   aquaculture marine and coastal non-indigenous species   MAR MAR003 003,Of the 1 416 marine non-indigenous species (NIS) in European Seas, 7% were introduced intentionally (via aquaculture and aquarium trade), while 93% invaded unintentionally. The main pathway for NIS introduction in European Seas is shipping (51%) followed by unintentional introductions via the marine Suez canal (37%), aquaculture related activities (17%) and, to a much lesser extent, aquarium trade (3%) and inland canals (2%) (Figure 1). However, it should be underlined that these percentages are only a best estimate because the introduction pathway is often uncertain. Previous studies have also shown that the most prominent invasion pathways are shipping and aquaculture activities (Streftaris et al., 2005). An exception to this general trend is the Mediterranean Sea, where the dominant invasion pathway (or vector) is the Suez Canal, which enables Red Sea species to migrate into the southeastern Mediterranean Sea and vice-versa. This phenomenon is also known as Lessepsian migration. Hull fouling is thought to have been the vector of introduction for many algal species (Mineur et al., 2007). A further analysis on the availablePan-European data shows that species introduced with hull fouling seem to dominate those associated with ballast water by 58% and 42% respectively of ship mediated introductions. This is also in agreement with other analysis (Gollasch, 2007). Trends in pathways of introduction (Figure 2) show that the rate of ship mediated NIS and those introduced via corridors have been increasing since the 1990s, while the rate of species introduction via aquaculture activities (imported and accidentally introduced with contaminants) is decreasing since the 2000s (Figure 3). However, to a lesser extent, aquarium trade emerges as a growing pathway in the past decade. Following the issue of biological invasion awareness, which was raised in the 1970s, a significant reduction in the main pathways of introduction is observed in the 1980s, except for shipping. Species introduced via the Suez Canal clearly reduced in the 1980s, but increased abruptly in the 1990s, following the deepening/widening of the Suez Canal. The decrease in aquaculture introductions can be attributed to the adoption of a specific EU regulation in 2007, showing management measures can be effective if properly implemented. This shows measures to prevent or control NIS introductions need to be stepped up. In addition, given that it is impossible to eradicate widely spread species, interception or closure of new pathways, following an integrated approach, seems to be the only effective strategy for reducing the spread of alien species and their future impacts."
"assessment  Trends in marine non-indigenous species   Available data shows that the seas around Europe currently harbor 1 416 non-indigenous species (NIS), almost 81% (1 143) of which have been introduced after 1950. These consist mostly of invertebrates (approx. 63%).   The rate of new introductions of NIS is continually increasing with 323 new species recorded since 2000 at pan-European level.   An increase in NIS introductions is observed for all regional seas. The most affected seas are in the Mediterranean, in particularin the Aegean-Levantine Sea. In this regionover 160 new species have been recorded from 2000 to 2010.   marine and coastal non-indigenous species  MAR MAR002 002,The seas around Europe harbor 1 416 non-indigenous species (NIS), almost 81% (1 143) of which have been introduced since 1950 (Figure 1). This information is also broken down by regional sea level (Figure 3). This is a current best estimate at Pan-European level, since many species have not yet been recorded. NIS consist primarily of invertebrates (~63%) - mostly crustaceans and molluscs, followed by primary producers (~25%)  marine plants and algae, and vertebrates (~12%) - mostly fish. The rate of new introductions of NIS is continually increasing with 323 new species reported since 2000 at Pan-European level (Figure 2). Of these, 287 were reported between 2001 and 2010, while 36 new NIS have been reported in the last three years (2011-2014). The latter is clearly an underestimate since there is usually a considerable time lag between the introduction of a NIS and its recording (i.e. in the order of a few years). At regional sea level (Figure 4), the rate of new introductions of NIS between 2001-2010 was highest in the Aegean-Levantine Sea (~ 17 species per year), followed by the Ionian Sea and the Central Mediterranean Sea (~ 8 species per year), the Western Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea (both with ~ 7 species per year), the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast (~ 5 species per year), the Adriatic Sea and the Greater North Sea ( both with ~ 4 species per year). The lowest rates were recorded in the Celtic Sea and Baltic Sea (~ 2 and 1 species per year, respectively). This trend continued in the 2011-2014 period, with the highest number of NIS observed in the Aegean-Levantine Sea (25 species), followed by the Adriatic and Celtic seas (13, 11 species respectively), the Ionian Sea and the Central Mediterranean Sea, Western Mediterranean Sea, and the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast with seven species each, the Greater North Sea and Baltic Sea with three new NIS each, whereas no new species were discovered in the Icelandic Sea."
"assessment  Aquaculture production     Marine aquaculture production is increasing in Europe, mostly due to salmon production in Norway. Other types of production are relatively stable since the early 2000s. All aquaculture production in the EU-28 has been equally stable.   In 2012, by far the most cultivated species in Europe was Atlantic salmon, followed by mussels, rainbow trout, European sea bass, gilthead sea bream, oysters and carps, barbels and other cyprinids.   Finfish production accounts for the increase in European aquaculture, while shellfish production has been slowly decreasing since 1999. Aquatic plants production has been emerging since 2007.     freshwater aquaculture marine and coastal   CSI CSI033 MAR MAR008 033 008,Overview of aquaculture production in Europe European aquaculture production has been rapidly increasing since the early 1990s, mainly due to the expansion of marine production(Figure 1). Only the marine sector has experienced a significant increase, while freshwater and brackish water production levels have not varied significantly.Aquaculture production in the EU-28 appears to be stagnant, in particular since 1999, when marine production stabilised. Between 2012 and 2002, marine aquaculture increased by 62% in Europe, compared to 3% in the EU-28 (Figure 3). Brackish water production decreased over the same period, by 43% at European level and 51% for the EU-28. Freshwater production also decreased most markedly in the EU-28 where it fell by 25%, compared to 1% in Europe overall. The biggest European producers are Norway(nearly 45% of the total European production), followed by Spain, France, United Kingdom, Italy, Turkey and Greece (Figure 2). These seven countries account for 86% of all aquaculture production in Europe. Norways production is due to the farming of Atlantic salmon, which accounts for about 94% of Norways total production. Spain is next with its production dominated by blue mussels followed by France with its production dominated by the Pacific cupped oyster (Crassostrea gigas). Turkish production consists mainly of trout, sea bream and sea bass.Atlantic salmon (51%), mussels (16%), trout (rainbow) (13%), sea bream (5%), sea bass (5%), oysters (3%) and cyprinids (3%) are the major species cultivated across Europe (figure 4 and figures 5-7 show production trends by environment).While Europe's production of marine finfish continues to grow, shellfish production has been slowly decreasing since 1999. Aquatic plants production has been emerging since 2007 (figure 8). Marine and brackish water production relative to coastline length The environmental pressures exerted by aquaculture are not uniform. The level of local impact will vary according to production scale and techniques, as well as the hydrodynamics and chemical characteristics of the region. In 2012, Spain (34), Norway (24), Netherlands (22), Malta (22) and Italy (13) had the highest mariculture(marine and brackish waters) production (measured in tonnes per km of coastline) in proportion to the length of coastline (figure 9). Interestingly the ranking in 2008 was Spain (31), France (27), Netherlands (20), Norway (16) and Italy (15) tonnes per km of coastline, revealing the increased production in Norway and Malta and the decrease in production in France. Turkey, with 10 tonnes per km of coastline, closely follows the above mentioned countries. Sweden (0.16), Finland (0.34) and Iceland (0.8) tonnes per km of coastline come bottom of the list. It should be noted that these figures simply follow those of mariculture production. These trends do not take into account the pressure exerted by different production systems (intensive, extensive or even closed systems) or the introduction of better and more efficient management techniques."
"assessment  Fishing fleet pressure    The EU fishing fleet displays strong regional differences in terms of its composition, but it is mostly made up of small vessels (59%). There has been a marked decrease in fishing fleet capacity (i.e. number of vessels)  between 2004 and 2001 , during which time small vessels decreased at an annual rate of approximately 1% and large vessels at 7% .     Most of the EU fishing effort is deployed by large vessels (74%) with mobile gears, of which the majority (61%) disturbs the seafloor. The decrease in capacity has been followed by a decrease in the effort of large vessels only (over 7% between 2004-2011), while the effort of small vessels has increased by approximately 5%. This is reflected in an overall shift towards gear with less impact on the seafloor.      The observed change of EU fishing effort and the shift towards gear with less impact is indicative of an overall decrease in fishing pressureand impact in European seas between 2004 and 2011.     fisheries marine and coastal  CSI CSI034 MAR MAR009 034 009,Fishing fleet capacity and effort The EU fishing fleet displays strong regional differences in terms of its composition. Small vessels constitute the majority of the fleet in the Mediterranean and Black Sea, and to a lesser extent those in the Baltic Sea, the Bay of Biscay and Western Waters regions(Figure 1). This is linked to recent changes in EU fishing fleet capacity (in terms of number of vessels) observed over the period 2004-2011 (Figure 2). Overall, fishing fleets decreased at a rate between approximately 1% per year for small vessels and more than 7% per year for large vessels (assuming that task specific engagement per vessel remains constant). The strong decrease in large vessels is observed across all regions (Black Sea not included in the analysis). The number of small vessels also decreased in the Baltic and Mediterranean Sea regions. Together with the Bay of Biscay, these are the three regions where there has been an overall net decrease in fishing fleet capacity in terms of number of vessels. Although small vessels compose most (59%) of the EU fishing fleet, fishing effort is largely deployed by large vessels (74%) (Figure 3).The amount of fishing effort also differs considerably between regions. Effort exerted by large vessels dominates in every region except for the Black Sea.Most of the effort is deployed in the deep sea, which is also the largest region, followed by the North Sea. The least explored regions are the Bay of Biscay and the Baltic Sea.The observed trends in EU fishing fleet capacity, together with the shift towards smaller vessels, have also led to similar changes in terms of effort. Between 2004 and 2011, an almost 5% per year increase in the fishing effort deployed by small vessels was observed while that of large vessels decreased by more than 7% for the same period. A comparison of the regional differences in capacity and effort clearly illustrates the weak relationship between the two. The Mediterranean fleet contributes 37% of the total EU capacity in terms of number of vessels, but only 14% of the EU effort. In contrast the deep sea region contributes only 18% of the total EU capacity, but 28% of the total EU effort. Deployment of fishing gear and impact on the seabed Most of the fishing effort (74%) uses mobile gear, of which the majority (61% of the effort) disturbs the sea floor (Figure 4).Bottom trawl and seine are the most common types of gear, and are applied by 43% of the fishing effort, followed by gillnets, pots and traps (23%). Regional differences are also observed reflecting the composition of regional fleets. The use of beam trawl and dredge, which have a high impact on the seafloor, is highest in the regions where large vessels are more common (i.e. in particular in the North Sea and the deep sea, followed by the western waters and Celtic Sea). These types of gear are only absent in the Black Sea and almost negligent in the Baltic Sea. On the other hand, the Black Sea is the only region where passive gear dominates over mobile gear.  In terms of change over time, between 2004 and 2011 (except for the Black Sea where data only became available from 2008 onwards), a decrease in the overall effort deployed by all types of gear is observed in the EU, in particular beam trawl and dredges (7.7%) and pelagic trawl and seines (7.2%) (Figure 5). At regional level, it is clear that there has been a marked decrease of effort deployed by bottom impacting gear across all regions, except for the Black Sea (bottom trawl/seines increased over 20% between 2008 and 2011) and in the Celtic Sea (pelagic trawl/seines increased 4.3%). An increase in more selective gear (in particular longlines) is also observed in the North Sea, Bay of Biscay, Western Waters and deep sea. Although the impact of technological improvements has to be taken into account (see Rijnsdorp et al 2006), the observed change of EU fishing effort and the shift towards gear with less impact on the seabed is indicative of a decrease in fishing pressureand impact in European seas between 2004 and 2011. These signs, however, need to be further quantified to understand the actual effects of this reduction of fishing effort on the ecosystem. References: Rijnsdorp, AD., Daan, N. Dekker, W. 2006.

"assessment  Status of marine fish stocks   Approximately 60% of commercial fish landings comes from stocks that are assessed with Good Environmental Status (GES) information. Strong regional differences exist, where the Mediterranean and Black seas remain poorly assessed.   Around 58% of the assessed commercial stocks are not in GES. Only 12% are in GES for both the level of fishing mortality and reproductive capacity.These percentages also vary considerably between regional seas.   The use of commercial fish and shellfish stocks in Europe, therefore, remains largely unsustainable.Nevertheless, important signs of improvement for certain stocks are being recorded in the North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea.   fish stocks fisheries good environmental status marine and coastal    CSI CSI032 MAR MAR007 032 007,Assessed vs non-assessed stocks Most European landings of commercial fish and shellfish stocks come from the North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic sea (86%) (Figure 1). Approximately 60% of European landings comes from stocks that are assessed - i.e. that have Good Environmental Status assessment information - although this is variable for the two analysed GES criteria on fishing mortality (F) and spawning stock biomass (SSB) (Figures 1 & 2). There is, however, a clear trend from north to south, with most of the landings coming from assessed stocks in the north (more than 90% in the Baltic sea) and less than 10% of the landings in some of the southern (Mediterranean and Black sea) regions. Status and trends of assessed fish stocks Of the 186 assessed stocks, around 40% come from the North-East Atlantic and Baltic Seas, and the remaining 60% from the Mediterranean and Black seas (although some tuna and tuna-like species have stocks in both the North-East Atlantic and Mediterranean seas)(Figure 3). Around 58% of the assessed commercial stocks in Europe,where the majority comes from the Mediterranean and Black Seas, are not in Good Environmental Status (GES). The remaining stocks are either partially or fully in GES. Thus, 20% of the stocks are fished at sustainableexploitation levels (i.e. F  FMSY), 10% have their reproductive capacityintact (i.e. SSB > SSBMSY)and only 12% are in GES for both criteria (Figure 3). These percentages vary considerably between regional seas: from all of the stocks meeting at least one of the GES indicators in some northerly regions (i.e. Baltic Sea, Barents Sea and Norwegian Sea), to none of the stocks in one southerly region (i.e. Adriatic Sea). The use of commercial fish and shellfish stocks in Europe, therefore, remains largely unsustainable, either because a large proportion of stocks are not assessed or because, for those assessed, only a small proportion is in Good Environmental Status for both criteria offishing mortality and spawning stock biomass. Nevertheless, important signs of improvement for certain stocks are being recorded in the North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea. This can be attributed to an overall decrease of the level of fishing pressure back to sustainable levels since the early 2000s (Figure 4). The status over time, based on 51 assessed stocks in the North-East Atlantic ocean and Baltic Sea, was estimated for a maximum of 41 stocks for both fishing mortality and reproductive capacity (Figure 4). It shows on average F increased over time from slightly above sustainable levels (i.e. MSY), until a maximum was reached in the late 1990s. At that time, fishing mortality was on average more than double the sustainable levels. It then followed a steep decline back towards sustainable levels. The increase in fishing mortality, until the late 1990s, resulted in a gradual decrease of the stocks reproductive capacity until the early 2000s. A minimum of just above the precautionary limitwas reached, indicating that, on average, reproductive capacity was at risk of being impaired. From the early 2000s onwards, the first signs of recovery have been visible."
"assessment  Chlorophyll in transitional, coastal and marine waters     Between 1985 and 2012, 7% of all stations in European seas that reported to the EEA showed decreasing trends in summer chlorophyll concentrations, whereas in 4% of the stations, increasing trends were found. In the majority of the stations (89%), no trends were observed.   Based on available data, chlorophyll concentrations, which are an indicator of eutrophication, are decreasing in the Greater North Sea, Bay of Biscay and Adriatic Sea, but increasing in many parts of the Baltic Sea. No trend assessment was possible for the Black Sea.     chlorophyll-a marine and coastal  CSI CSI023 MAR MAR006 023 006,Baltic Sea In 2012, the highest measured summer chlorophyll-a concentrations (> 11.4 g/l) were found in German, Polish and Latvian coastal waters. Low concentrations (< 2.2 g/l) were predominantly observed along the Swedish coast and in the open waters of the southern Baltic Sea (Figure 1). Trend analysis showed increasing concentrations in 6% (23) of Baltic Sea stations (Figures 2 and 3). These stations were located in offshore and coastal waters in the Baltic Proper, the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia. Decreasing concentrations were detected at 4% (15) of stations, mainly along the coast of Finland and in the western Baltic Sea. Greater North Sea In 2012, the highest summer chlorophyll-a concentrations (> 8.9 g/l) were mainly observed along the coast of the Netherlands, and some coastal locations in Belgium and Germany (Figure 1). These areas are also characterised by elevated concentrations of nutrients and frequent blooms of Phaeocystis globosa (OSPAR, 2008). According to OSPAR (2010), further action is needed to improve problem areas like the continental coast of the Greater North Sea. Low chlorophyll concentrations (< 1.3 g/l) were predominantly observed in the open waters outside the Netherlands and in the Kattegat (Figure 1). A significant number of stations (19%) showed a decreasing trend based on long time series data (> 10 years). These stations are generally located in transitional and coastal waters along the Belgian, Dutch and Swedish coasts. (Figures 2 and 3). Celtic Seas, Bay of Biscay and the Iberian coast High chlorophyll concentrations (> 5.1 g/l) were mainly observed in coastal stations along the Irish coast and in a few French locations (Figure 1). OSPAR (2008) has defined small coastal embayments and estuaries within the Celtic Seas, the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast as problem areas with respect to eutrophication. A decrease was observed in 9% of Atlantic stations in the coastal waters of France and Ireland (Figures 2 and 3). Mediterranean Sea Most of the chlorophyll concentrations measured in the Mediterranean Sea in 2012 were classified as low (< 0.16 g/l) and medium (0.16-2.7 g/l), with the exception of a few stations in Montenegro, in which the concentrations were considered as high (> 2.7 g/l). Most of the concentrations reported by Cyprus were found to be low (Figure 1). No offshore Mediterranean chlorophyll concentration data has been reported to the EEA for 2012. The open waters of the Mediterranean Sea are, however, poor in nutrients and thus summer chlorophyll-a concentrations are also low. The most eutrophic waters in the Mediterranean are along the northern coastline, but the eutrophication problem has also been increasing gradually over the last few decades in the southern shores of the sea (UNEP 2007). Harmful algal blooms have been observed commonly in northern coastal areas. These blooms have also consisted of dinoflagellates (e.g.DinophysisandAlexandrium), which can potentially cause different types of shellfish poisoning (Koukaras and Nikolaidis 2004, Bravo et al. 2008). Trends were evaluated for Croatia, France and Slovenia, for which sufficient time series data was available. In most locations, no significant trends were found, with the exception of a few locations along the Croatian coast and one transitional water station in the Gulf of Lyons where decreasing trends were found (Figures 2 and 3). Black Sea For the Black Sea, a limited number of stations were reported by Bulgaria in 2012. In these locations, the chlorophyll concentrations were found to be either low (< 0.94 g/l) or medium (0.94 - 10.6 g/l) (Figure 1). The time series was too short to perform a trend analysis."
"assessment  Nutrients in transitional, coastal and marine waters    Between 1985 and 2012, m ost stations in European Seas  that reported to the EEA showed no change in trends of concentrations of  Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) or  orthophosphate. In addition, a decrease in concentrations was observed for 14% and 13% respectively, while only a minority of stations showed an increase.   These trends mostly refer to stations in the northeast Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea, however, due to lack of reported data for other regional seas. A vailable data shows nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are decreasing in the southern North Sea which is an area with a recognised eutrophication problem. In the Baltic Sea, also affected by eutrophication, nitrogen concentrations are decreasing but phosphate concentrations show an increase at some stations.      oxidised nitrogen nitrite orthophosphate csi oxidized nitrogen nutrients ammonium water nitrate marine and coastal concentrations thematic assessments inorganic nitrogen no2 no3               CSI CSI021 MAR MAR005 021 005,Baltic Sea In 2012, the highest DIN concentrations (> 22.5 mol/l) were predominantly observed in coastal waters of Germany, Poland, Lithuania and Russia (Figure 1). High oxidised nitrogen concentrations (> 19 mol/l) coincided with locations with high DIN (Figure 2). Low concentrations of DIN (< 5.4 mol/l) were measured along the Swedish coast and in the Baltic Proper. Areas with high orthophosphate concentrations (> 1.1 mol/l) included the Gulf of Finland and certain coastal locations along the German and Polish coasts (Figure 3). Low phosphate concentrations (< 0.6 mol/l) were commonly observed in the Baltic Proper and Gulf of Bothnia. Between 1985 and 2012, DIN concentrations decreased in 7% (11) of monitoring stations and increased in 3% (5) of monitoring stations (Figures 4 & 7). When oxidised nitrogen (OxN) is considered, 7% (12) of monitoring stations showed a decreasing trend, as opposed to an increasing trend shown in 2% (2) of stations (Figures 5 & 8). In the majority of the stations (90%), no significant trend was observed for both DIN and OxN. The direct comparison of DIN and OxN trends is not possible since the number of stations for each variable differs. However, decreasing nitrogen trends were mainly detected in open water stations, Swedish and Danish coastal waters in the western Baltic Sea. Increasing DIN trends were observed in some coastal waters in the Gulf of Finland mainly. Orthophosphate concentrations decreased in 4% (6) of stations and increased in 9% (15) of stations (Figure 6). Increasing orthophosphate trends were mainly detected in coastal waters. Decreasing trends were observed mainly in the western Baltic Sea along the Danish and German coast (Figure 9). Greater North Sea In the Greater North Sea, the highest winter concentrations of DIN (> 64 mol/l) and orthophosphate (> 1.3 mol/l) in 2012 were observed in transitional and coastal waters along the Belgian, Dutch and German coast (Figures 1 & 3). Open sea stations showed predominantly low DIN (< 9.2 mol/l) and OxN (< 8 mol/l) concentrations (Figures 1 & 2). Long term (> 10 years) time series indicate that DIN concentrations are declining. In fact, a decreasing trend was observed in 27% (26) of stations of the North Sea, mainly located in transitional and coastal waters along the Belgian, Dutch and German coast. None of the stations showed an increasing trend (Figures 4 & 7). A similar trend was observed for orthophosphate, which decreased in 29% (34) stations of the Greater North Sea (Figures 5 & 8), predominantly in transitional and coastal waters of Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Increasing trends in orthophosphate were only recorded in one station. This positive development in nutrient reduction, in particular in phosphorus, can be attributed toimproved waste watertreatment, which led to a significant reduction of phosphorus loading in most North Sea countries in the period 1985 to 2005 (OSPAR 2008). Celtic Seas, Bay of Biscay and the Iberian coast In 2012, measurements of DIN (and OxN) concentrations were generally limited to Irish and British coastal waters, and some data for the coast of Spain (Figures 1 & 2). High concentrations of DIN (> 59 mol/l) were observed in coastal waters of Ireland and Great Britain, whereas the concentrations in the coastal stations of Spain were mainly classified as low (< 7 mol/l).  The coverage of coastal stations was much higher for orthophosphate than for nitrogen, in particular along the Bay of Biscay (Figure 3). Most orthophosphate concentrations were classified as low (< 0.4 mol/l) or medium (0.4  1.1 mol/l), with the exception of a few Irish coastal stations, in which the orthophosphate concentrations were found to be high (> 1.1 mol/l). Not enough time series data was available to evaluate trends in DIN concentrations in Atlantic waters. For oxidised nitrogen, no trends were observed at stations in Ireland. As for orthophosphate, no remarkable trends were observed except for a decreasing trend in three out of 24 French stations in the Bay of Biscay (Figures 6 & 9). Mediterranean Sea (combined assessment) Only a limited number of measurements were reported by Cyprus, Spain, Croatia and Slovenia. For this reason, the assessments for the regional seas within the Mediterranean sea were combined. Nutrient concentrations in the open Mediterranean Sea are extremely low and eutrophicationis only observed in some coastal waters (UNEP 2007). All of the DIN measurements were classified either as low (< 2.3 mol/l) or medium (2.3-27 mol/l) (Figure 1). High orthophosphate concentrations (> 0.5 mol/l) were observed in two coastal stations in Spain, close to the Strait of Gibraltar (Figure 3). There were only a few notable changes in nutrient concentrations as most stations showed no significant trends (Figure 3,4 & 7,8). However, the evaluation of trends was hampered by the limited number of measurements. Black Sea No data for winter means of nutrients in 2012 were available for the Black Sea. Due to lack of data, it was not possible to perform trend analyses. References:  HELCOM, 2009.

"hazardous-substances-in-marine-organisms-1  Hazardous substances in marine organisms   In 2012, the concentrations of the eight assessed hazardous substances were generally: Low or Moderate for  Hexachlorobenzene  (HCB) and lindane; Moderate for cadmium, mercury, lead,  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane  (DDT) and 6-Benzylaminopurine BAP; and Moderate or High for  polychlorinated biphenyl  (PCB).    A general downward trend was found between 2003 and 2012 in the North-East Atlantic for cadmium, lead, lindane, PCB, DDT and BAP, and also in the Baltic Sea for lindane and PCB. No trends could be calculated for the other regional seas.    hazardous substances sea marine and coastal   CSI CSI049 MAR MAR001 049 001,CADMIUMAssessment of sub-indicator: Summary:Concentrations of cadmium in recent years were generally classified as Moderate in mussels and fish of the North-East Atlantic, fish in the Baltic Sea, and mussels in the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. A general downward regional trend was detected in the North-East Atlantic, which gives some indication that conditions are improving (assessment based on results for 2003-2012). Cadmium is primarily produced as a byproduct of the extraction, smelting and refining of zinc and other non-ferrous metals (EEA, 2011). The main sources, at least in the North Sea, are from general waste/disposal and industrial activities (NSC, 2002). Sources of the metal in the environment include mining and production, the metal (including steel) and coating/electroplating industries, the production and deposition of nickel-cadmium batteries, the burning of fossil fuels, the use of phosphate fertilisers, waste incineration, leaching from waste deposits and, finally, the use of cadmium salts as a stabiliser and/or colouring agent. Cadmium is widely present at Low concentrations in the Earth's crust, but human activities have caused a general mobilisation of the metal in aquatic and terrestrial environments. Elevated levels of cadmium can be found in the sediment in estuarine and coastal waters of the Baltic Sea (HELCOM, 2010) and the North Sea (OSPAR, 2010). Re-suspension of hazardous substances can occur if sediments are disturbed or displaced by, for example, dredging (OSPAR 2009). There is also evidence of significant atmospheric transport (OSPAR, 2004). It is not needed for any organism (it is not essential) and the metal is highly toxic. The metal affects vital biological processes such as ion exchange, energy production and protein synthesis, mainly through interaction with the metabolism of essential trace metals such as zinc and calcium. In marine ecosystems, some seabird species (eating contaminated mussels) have been identified as possibly the most sensitive component through secondary poisoning (OSPAR 1996, 2004). Due to its environmental toxicity and threat to human health, cadmium is classified as a Priority Hazardous Substance under the Environmental Quality Standards Directive (2008/105/EC), which requires that all discharges, emissions and losses cease over time. The station-by-station overview of 2003-2012 concentrations of cadmium for mussels (both Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis) indicated that concentrations were generally Moderate and to a lesser degree Low. Elevated concentrations were often associated with estuaries for large rivers, in areas with point discharges (e.g. Srfjord, western Norway) and in some harbours. The areas from which mussels did not appear to be suitable for human consumption were found in 10 cases in France, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Romania (Figure 1). 312 temporal trends - 286 for mussels and 26 for fish - were statistically analysed on a station-by-station basis, out of a total of 406 datasets. Of these, only 69 (22.1%) were significant, 48 downwards and 21 upwards. Inputs have been decreasing in the North-East Atlantic (cf. EEA 2011). The regional assessment for this region indicated a general statistically significant downward trend. Moderate concentrations are in general decreasing for this region (Figure 1). Concentrations in one area with High concentrations (Srfjord, Norway) are decreasing. Considering all classes, most downward trends were found in Norway as well as Ireland and the United Kingdom. MERCURYAssessment of sub-indicator: Summary:Concentrations of mercury in recent years were generally classified as Moderate in mussels and fish of the North-East Atlantic and the Baltic Sea, and mussels in the Mediterranean. There is a majority of upward trends in the North-East Atlantic (assessment based on results for 2003-2012). The main anthropogenic sources of mercury are from general waste/disposal and industrial activities (EEA, 2011). It is still used in various products, e.g. batteries and electronics. Furthermore, low quantities in fossil fuels and municipal waste ensure continued emissions of mercury into the atmosphere. Mercury is subject to long-range transboundary transport (EEA, 2011). It has no known biological function. It is highly toxic and is considered one of the most dangerous metals in the aquatic environment due to it's toxicity and potential for bioaccumulation/biomagnification, particularly under anoxic conditions, which favour the transformation of inorganic mercury into organic forms. Organic forms of mercury affect the nervous system, whereas the inorganic forms affect a range of cellular processes. In marine ecosystems, organisms at the top of food chains, mainly seabirds and marine mammals have been identified as being most sensitive (through secondary poisoning) (OSPAR 2004). Mercury, as well as DDT (discussed below), is shown to be a major culprit for the decline in populations of predatory birds in the '60s and '70s. These populations have since recovered mainly because of restrictions on the discharge of mercury and the banning of DDT. There is a continuous microbial transformation of inorganic to organic mercury in the aquatic environment and mercury in, for example, fish is nearly all organic mercury. Methyl mercury is one of the few environmental contaminants that has been established as embryotoxic to humans. Elevated levels of mercury can be found in the sediment in estuarine and coastal waters of the Baltic Sea (HELCOM, 2010) and North Sea (OSPAR, 2010). Re-suspension of hazardous substances can occur if sediments are disturbed or displaced by, for example, dredging (OSPAR 2009).The Polar Regions are affected by long-range transported mercury, and the concentration in some marine mammals seems to have increased over the previous two decades (AMAP, 2011). The Arctic marine food web is often in focus regarding the risk of mercury to ecosystems. It is, however, important to acknowledge that the impacts of mercury are not only restricted to the Polar Regions. In warmer waters, predatory marine mammals may also be exposed to mercury levels that threaten health. Due to its environmental toxicity and threat to human health, mercury is classified as a Priority Hazardous Substance under the Environmental Quality Standards Directive (2013/39/EU), which requires that all discharges, emissions and losses cease over time. The station-by-station overview of 2003-2012 concentrations of mercury for mussels (both Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis) and fish indicated that concentrations were generally Moderate and, to a lesser degree, Low. High concentrations, i.e. concentrations that are not suitable for human consumption, were found in seven cases for mussels (six in areas of Italy and one station in Croatia) and three cases for fish (Denmark, United Kingdom and Norway). 401 temporal trends - 330 for mussels, 71 for fish - were statistically analysed on a station-by-station basis, out of a total of 501 datasets. of these, only 63 (15.7%) were significant, 32 down and 31 up (Figure 1). Inputs to the North-East Atlantic have remained about 50% below the 1990 average since 1995 (cf. EEA 2011). No statistically significant general trend was found for any region, however, an upward trend was found for Moderate concentrations in the Mediterranean Sea (Figure 1). Most downward trends (regardless of class) were found in the United Kingdom and Norway. Most upward trends were found only in the United Kingdom, Denmark and Norway. The one station with High concentrations and an upward trend was in the Netherlands. LEADAssessment of sub-indicator: Summary:Concentrations of lead in recent years were generally classified as Moderate in mussels and fish of the North-East Atlantic, Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. A regional downward trend was found for the North-East Atlantic(assessment based on results for 2003-2012).  Lead is widely distributed in the crust of the Earth, most commonly found with deposits of other metals like zinc, cadmium, silver and copper. The main anthropogenic sources are from general waste/disposal and industrial activities (NSC, 2002). There is evidence of significant atmospheric transport (OSPAR, 2004). Lead is non-essential and toxic. Lead has a high affinity for particles and is rarely found in high concentrations in seawater. Some algae are especially sensitive to lead (OSPAR 1996), but lead may affect aquatic species at different trophic levels. In vertebrates, lead predominantly accumulates in bone and blood. Exposure to high concentrations will cause decreased synthesis of hemoglobin and eventually anemia. Severe exposure to inorganic lead may cause encephalopathy and mental retardation. Exposure to high concentrations will also cause decreased synthesis of haemoglobin and eventually anaemia. The station-by-station overview of 2003-2012 concentrations of lead for mussels (both Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis) and fish indicated that concentrations were generally Moderate and to a lesser degree Low for the North-East Atlantic, the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black seas. (Figure 1). High concentrations, i.e. concentrations that are not suitable for human consumption, were found mainly along the North-West coast of Italy, Sardinia and the Spanish coast of the Bay of Biscay. 346 temporal trends - 333 for mussels, 13 for fish - were statistically analysed on station-by-station basis, out of 457 datasets. Of these, 63 (18.2%) were significant, 46 downwards and 17 upwards. Inputs have been decreasing in the North-East Atlantic (cf. EEA 2011). This is reflected in the general downward trend for mussels and fish for this region. Low and Moderate concentrations in the North-East Atlantic are, in general, decreasing (Figure 1). Upward trends were found where there were High concentrations at three stations in Italy as well as a station in Denmark. HCBAssessment of sub-indicator:  Summary:Concentrations of HCB in recent years were generally classified as Low or Moderate in the North-East Atlantic, the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. A general regional trend downwards was detected in the North-East Atlantic, which gives some indication that conditions are improving(assessment based on results for 2003-2012). HCB (hexachlorobenzene) is formed as a by-product, impurity, or intermediate in various manufacturing processes, including the production of chlorinated solvents and pesticides. HCB is also formed as a product of incomplete combustion in a variety of combustion and incineration processes. Control of HCB is hampered by its long range atmospheric transport from other regions. It was used as a biocide until 1965. Chronic exposure can be a health risk to humans. Persistent organic contaminants (e.g. HCB, lindane, PCBs and DDT) have low water solubility, high lipophilicity and are resistant to biodegradation. These properties lead to uptake and accumulation in the fatty tissues of living organisms, in some instances causing biomagnification through food chains. The highest concentrations of organic contaminants are, therefore, found in top predators, such as sea birds, marine mammals and polar bear (Bernhoft et al. 1997; Ruus et al. 2002). Adverse effects may comprise disruption of the immune system, disruption of hormone production or transport, impairment of reproduction, embryonic damage, cancer, or damage to the nerve system. The station-by-station overview of 2003-2012 concentrations of HCB (hexachlorobenzene) for mussels (both Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis) indicated that concentrations were generally Low or Moderate (Figure 1). High concentrations were found at 10 mussel stations (one in Italy, three on the North coast of Spain, three in the United Kingdom and three in Romania). High concentrations were also found at two fish stations (Norway and Estonia). 159 temporal trends - 118 for mussels, 41 for fish - statistically analysed on a station-by-station basis, out of 253 datasets. Of these, 20 (12.6%) were significant, 17 down and three up (Figure 1). A regional downward trend was found for the North-East Atlantic. Moderate concentrations in this region are decreasing (Figure 1). Only three upward trends were found; two in the Low class and one in the Moderate class. Considering that concentrations are generally Low or Moderate in the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea and North-East Atlantic, the predominance of no trends or downward trends is a positive signal. LINDANEAssessment of sub-indicator: Summary:Concentrations of lindane in recent years were generally classified as Low or Moderate in the North-East Atlantic, the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean. Regional downward trends were found in the North-East Atlantic and the Baltic Sea which are positive signs(assessment based on results for 2003-2012). Lindane or HCH (1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane), also known as benzenehexachloride (BHC), is a pesticide that is still used in parts of the world. Non-agricultural use of lindane includes use for wood preservation, as an insecticide, as rodenticide and for medicinal purposes (scab and louse ointments). Lindane is an irritant in humans and may affect mucus membranes, immune and nervous systems following exposure. Lindane is present in high concentrations in the fat of Arctic seals and polar bears. From the limited data available on acute and chronic toxicity, some crustacean species appear to be particularly sensitive to lindane (and of course insects in freshwater), whereas e.g. molluscs and algae do not appear to be very sensitive (OSPAR 1996, 2004). In addition to the general adverse effects related to persistent organic contaminants (cf. see text for HCB), lindane is also present in high concentrations in the fat of Arctic mammals (seals, polar bears). The station-by-station overview of 2003-2012 concentrations of lindane (gamma HCH) for mussels (both Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis) and fish indicated that concentrations were predominantly Low in the North-East Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea and Moderate in the Baltic Sea (Figure 1). High concentrations in mussels were generally found on the Italian west coast and secondarily the north coast of Spain and Brittany. 156 temporal trends - 125 for mussels, 31 for fish - were statistically analysed on a station-by-station basis, out of 253 datasets. Of these, 72 (46.2%) were significant, 68 downwards and 4 upwards (Figure 1). Inputs have been decreasing in the North-East Atlantic (cf. EEA 2011). Regional trend analysis indicated a general decrease in lindane in the North-East Atlantic as well as in the Baltic Sea. Low and Moderate concentrations in the North-East Atlantic are, in general, decreasing (Figure 1). The four stations with upwards trends were located on the Spanish coast of the Bay of Biscay; all of these with Low concentrations. PCBAssessment of sub-indicator: Summary:Concentrations of PCB in recent years were generally classified as Moderate or Low in the North-East Atlantic, Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Regional downward trends were found in the North-East Atlantic and the Baltic Sea which are positive signs(assessment based on results for 2003-2012). Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of theoretically 209 different compounds (congeners) of which 150-160 are found in the environment. It should be noted that the range of PCBs includes very different substances, both with regard to physio-chemical properties and with regard to their biological activity. A distinction is commonly made between the generally more carcinogenic 'dioxin-like' PCBs (non- and mono-ortho chlorinated) and the more immunotoxic 'bulky' PCBs (chlorinated in 2 ortho positions). All PCBs are man-made, but are now found all over Earth due to their persistence and relative volatility. PCBs have been previously widely used in electrical equipment, and also as a plasticiser and paint additive. In addition to the general adverse effect related to persistent organic contaminants (cf. see text for HCB), PCBs have extreme mobility and the ability to bioaccumulate and magnify in marine food webs, where long-lived animals at high trophic levels appear to be most at risk from PCBs. As for DDT, PCBs are thought to be involved in the observed reproductive problems of polar bears and possibly earlier morphological aberrations in Baltic seals (namely due to chemical pollution from the river Rhine in the 1980s; Reijnders 1986). PCBs have been associated with lymphocyte proliferation in seal pups, which can result in greater susceptibility to infection (Levin et al. 2005). PCBs have potentially endocrine-disrupting properties (EEA, 2011). Furthermore, suppression of immune system function (specifically natural killer cell activity) in seals fed Baltic Sea herring (also highly contaminated with PCBs) has been observed (Ross et al., 1996). There is also an indication of contaminant-associated suppression of antibody-mediated immunity in polar bears (Bernhoft et al., 2000). The station-by-station overview of 2003-2012 concentrations of PCB (sum of congeners 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180) for mussels (both Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis) and fish indicated that concentrations were generally Moderate or Low (Figure 1). Less than 8% of the stations had Low concentrations. High concentrations were found in every country that submitted data except Estonia, Croatia, Slovenia, Poland and Romania. It should be noted that High concentrations do not necessarily mean a risk to human health. 319 temporal trends - 250 for mussels, 69 for fish - were statistically analysed on a station-by-station basis, out of 404 datasets. Of these, 59 (18.5%) were significant, 45 downwards and 14 upwards (Figure 1). Inputs have been decreasing in the North-East Atlantic (cf. EEA 2011). Regional trend analysis indicated a general decrease in PCB in the North-East Atlantic as well as in the Baltic Sea. Moderate concentrations for these two regions are decreasing, however High concentrations in the Mediterranean are in general increasing (Figure 1). The 42 downward trends where High or Moderate concentrations were registered at stations in France, Denmark, Estonia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden. Ten of the eleven upward trends where High concentrations were registered were found in Italy. DDTAssessment of sub-indicator: Summary:Concentrations of DDT in recent years were predominantly classified as Moderate in the North-East Atlantic, Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. A general regional trend downwards was detected in the North-East Atlantic, which gives some indication that conditions are improving(assessment based on results for 2003-2012). DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) is a synthetic organochlorine insecticide that was first used to control insects that were vectors for human diseases at the end of World War II. After the war, it found a ready market in peacetime agricultural enterprise. All use of DDT was discontinued in western European countries around 1990, although heavy use was banned two decades earlier. However, in developing countries, the need for cheap insecticides (to control mosquitoes, and hence malaria) has kept DDT in use also in later years. Furthermore, in some areas, e.g. in fruit-growing areas in western Norway, there are recent inputs of DDT, probably due to leaching from buried waste or unused canisters. In addition, there is continued leaching from soil and river sediments in some areas. DDT has, over the past 50-60 years, been spread over the entire globe and is now found in all natural waters and organisms. In addition to the general adverse effects related to persistent organic contaminants (cf. see text for HCB), DDT and its derivates have been found responsible for eggshell thinning and consequent decline in populations of predatory birds in 60s and 70s, a situation that has since has improved, in part due the banning of DDT. There is also evidence that a metabolite of DDT (p,p-DDE) may have consequences for the reproduction of marine animals by affecting testosterone levels (Subramanian et al. 1987). The station-by-station overview of 2003-2012 concentrations of DDT (using pp'DDE as a surrogate for DDT) for mussels (both Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis) and fish indicated that concentrations were generally Moderate (Figure 1). Less than 9% of the stations had Low concentrations. High concentrations were found in every country that submitted data except Estonia, Finland, Croatia and Romania. It should be noted that High concentrations do not necessarily mean a risk to human health. 214 temporal trends - 179 for mussels, 35 for fish - were statistically analysed on a station-by-station basis out of 274 datasets. of these, 33 (15.4%) were significant, 24 down and 9 up (Figure 1). The regional trend for the North-East Atlantic indicated a general decrease. Moderate concentrations in this region are decreasing (Figure 1). Six of the eight stations with High concentrations and upwards trends were located on the West coast of Italy, the other two in a fjord on the West coast of Norway.  Benzo[a]pyrene (BAP) Assessment of sub-indicator: Summary:Concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene (BAP) in recent years were generally classified as Moderate in the North-East Atlantic, Baltic Sea and Mediterranean Sea. Generally there was a predominance of downward trends over upward trends and a regional downward trend was found in the North-East Atlantic (assessment based on results for 2003-2012). Benzo[a]pyrene (BAP) is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). Its metabolites are mutagenic and highly carcinogenic. It occurs naturally but concentrations can be excessive due to anthropogenic activities. Emissions to the atmosphere are far greater than other discharges. Hence, emission reduction measures need to focus upon combustion processes, including those related to the transport sector as well as coal- and wood-powered heating and electricity-generating plants (EEA 2011). The station-by-station overview of BAP for mussels (both Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis) indicated that concentrations were generally Moderate (Figure 1). Less than 3% of the stations had Low concentrations. The two stations with High concentrations were found in Spain and Norway. It should be noted that High concentrations do not necessarily mean a risk to human health. 113 temporal trends -all for mussels - were statistically analysed on a station-by-station basis, out of a total of 169. of these, only 17 (15.0%) were significant, 14 downwards and 3 upwards (Figure 1). The general trend in the North-East Atlantic is downward. Moderate concentrations in this region are decreasing (Figure 1). References   2013/39/EC.

Report of the 3rd workshop, The Hague 25-29 November 1996. ,This indicator covers the North-East Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. The assessment results show that concentrations are generally Low or Moderate for all eight hazardous substances(Figure 1). Cadmium, lead and mercury are found at low concentrations in the Earth's crust and occur naturally in seawater. HCB, lindane, PCB and DDT are synthetic substances that are not found naturally in the environment. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compound benzo(a)pyrene occurs naturally but, as with the other contaminants, human activities have caused a general mobilisation of these hazardous substances that can result in harmful effects in aquatic and terrestrial environments. In the marine environment, they accumulate in fish and shell fish, and because these, in return, are a food source for marine wildlife and humans the substances are moved to higher levels in the food chain. The contaminants are not needed for any organism (they are not essential) and are toxic. In humans long-term exposure or consumption of contaminated seafoods can be detrimental. For this reasonseven of the eight chemicalshave been banned from use (only BAP is not banned).The main sources, at least in the North Sea, are from general waste/disposal, burning of fossil fuels and industrial activities (NSC, 2002), including mining and production. The EEA has published a more thorough description of their sources and dangers to the environment (EEA 2011). This assessment is based on data reported to the EEA by EEA member countries where there are some issues with data availability and quality. The assessment therefore does not necessarily convey the uncertainty these problems cause. It also should be noted that the three-class system applied for assessing the concentrations of hazardous substances does not necessarily highlight where there is a risk to human consumption. The key assessment can be summarised as follows: The decrease in inputs to the North-East Atlantic since 1990 (EEA 2011) is reflected in the general decrease in concentrations for seven of the eight contaminants (i.e., cadmium, lead, HCB, lindane, DDT, PCB and BAP) in mussels and fish in this region, 2003-2012. This indicates that the measures and initiatives to reduce the input of these substances and to protect the marine environment are of some success. Abatement policies have also been in effect for the Baltic Sea and concentrations have, in general, decreased for lindane and PCB during the period 2003 to 2012. This indicated that abatement policies in this region were of some success. The assessment of the Mediterranean is based on contributions from four countries: Croatia, France, Italy and Slovenia. Policies to reduce pollution have been in effect here but no general regional trend was detected. An improvement in data reporting is needed to provide a better estimate of levels and trends for this sea. Data for the Black Sea concerned only concentrations of cadmium, lead, HCB and lindane in mussels from four stations in Romania. Concentrations were Moderate to High. No trends were discerned.

Data from the Black Sea were insufficient for this assessment. The results reveal that concentrations are generally Low or Moderate for all seven hazardous substances. Cadmium, lead and mercury are found at Low concentrations in the earth's crust and occur naturally in seawater. HCB, lindane, PCB and DDT are synthetic substances that are not found naturally in the environment.

This assessment is based on data reported to the EEA by EEA member countries where there is some lack of consistent or reliable data. The assessment does not necessarily convey the uncertainty these problems cause. It also should be noted that the three-class system applied for concentrations of hazardous substances in fish does not highlight those cases where there is a risk to human consumption. The key assessment can be summarized as follows:   The decrease in inputs to the north-east Atlantic since 1990 (EEA 2011) is reflected in the general decrease in concentrations for five of the seven contaminants (i.e., lead, HCB, lindane, PCB and DDE) in mussels and fish in this region. This indicates that the measures and initiatives to reduce the input of these substances and to protect the marine environment are of some success.     Abatement policies have also been in effect for the Baltic Sea and concentrations have in general decreased for lindane during the period 1998-2010 (Figure 1). This indicated that abatement policies in this region were of some success.      The assessment of the Mediterranean is based on contributions from four countries: Croatia, France, Italy and Slovenia. Policies to reduce pollution have been in effect here and regional time trends for mussels have been more effective for lindane where a general downward trend was detected compared to mercury and lead where a general upward trend was detected. An improvement in data reporting is needed to give a better basis for long-term trends can be estimated.      Data for the Black Sea concerned only 7 mussel stations for 2005 and 2007 but for methodological reasons no conclusions could be drawn for this region.  "
"assessment  Household expenditure on consumption categories with differing environmental pressure intensities   Between 1996 and 2012, trends in household spending patterns were mixed. The trend, however, is towards an increasing share of consumption categories with reduced environmental pressures per Euro spent. In addition, almost all consumption categories have also seen reductions in environmental pressure intensities.   Together, these two developments are likely to have caused a relative decoupling of environmental pressures from growth in household consumption expenditure.    household consumption soer2015 european coicop household expenditure soer2015     CSI CSI043 SCP SCP013 043 013,Over the period assessed, two main relative decoupling effects can be identified from changes in household consumption expenditure categories. First, there has been a shift in consumption expenditure from categories with high environmental pressure intensities (pressures per Euro spent) to ones with lower intensities due to changes in consumption patterns. Second, a reduction has been seen in the environmental pressure intensities of individual consumption categories. While the policy question addressed here is mainly concerned with changes in consumption patterns, this indicator can also be used to illustrate the second decoupling effect. Trends in consumption expenditure reveal a moderate shift in consumption expenditure patterns to less environmentally intensive types of goods and services. Interpretation of such shifts between consumption categories is not straightforward, however. For example, if a household saved money by buying cheaper food produced in a less environmentally friendly manner (and instead spent it on recreation, for example), this would not necessarily lead to less environmental pressures overall. Changes in spending patternswithina consumption category can, in turn, change the pressure intensity of that category. The distribution of expenditure (in current prices) between the 12 COICOP categories changed only slightly between 1996 and 2012 (Figure 1). This is unsurprising as a large majority of household expenditure is, in practice, fixed. However, there have been modest changes, with growth in the share of low impact expenditure categories such as on education, communication and health. However, there has also been a three percentage point growth in the share of household expenditure on housing and utilities  a high impact expenditure category. The economic downturn that started in 2008, as well as the fact that prices for this category increased more than average inflation, might have influenced this development.Meanwhile, the share of household expenditure used for transport, food, furnishings and equipment  also high impact consumption categories  has fallen. Per capita expendituremeasured in chain linked volumes (Figure 2) has grown in all consumption categories except alcoholic beverages, tobacco and narcotics, which actually fell 17%. The two most rapidly growing consumption categories, communications (which grew a staggering 208%) and recreation and culture (which grew 76%), are two of the categories with the lowest environmental pressure intensities (Figures 3-6). Health expenditure also grew by 47%, another low-intensity expenditure category. As expenditure on all categories (except alcohol, tobacco and narcotics) has either remained stable or increased between 1996 and 2012, the overall changes in spending patterns are likely to have had a relative, as opposed to an absolute, decoupling effect on environmental impacts caused by consumption. This is because pressures caused by consumption will have grown, but less rapidly than overall consumption expenditure. Figures 3-6 demonstrate that, almost without exception, all 12 consumption categories have seen reductions in environmental pressure intensities between 2000 and 2007. However, it should be noted that this could have been caused by improvements in the production processes of individual goods and services within each consumption category, but also by shifts in the products being purchased within each consumption category. For example, a shift from the use of private cars to trains will show up as a reduction in pressure intensity in the Transport COICOP category in Figures 3-6. It should be noted that other environmental pressures and impacts, such as biodiversity loss, emissions to water and soil and land use impacts due to European consumption, are at least as important in a consumption perspective, but such data is currently not available in a comparable format."
"assessment  Waste generation   European economic production and consumption have become less waste intensive, even after the economic downturn since 2008 is considered in the analysis.   From the production side, waste generation from manufacturing in the EU-28 and Norway declined by 25% in absolute terms between 2004 and 2012, despite an increase of 7% in sectoral economic output. Waste generation by the service sector declined by 23% in the same period, despite an increase of 13% in sectoral economic output.   Turning to consumption, total municipal waste generation in EEA countries declined by 2% between 2004 and 2012, despite a 7% increase in real household expenditure.   One of the objectives in EU waste policy is to reduce waste generation in absolute terms, within the overall goal to decouple economic growth from resource use and environmental impacts. Waste prevention efforts across Europe seems to contribute to the waste objectives; with considerable differences between the countries. Wider analysis across different economic sectors within and beyond EU borders will be needed in order to provide more comprehensive conclusions.  CSI CSI041 WST WST004 041 004,The waste hierarchy, the guiding framework in EU and national waste policies, gives the highest priority to waste prevention, followed by (preparing for) re-use, recycling, other recovery and disposal. The highest priority to waste prevention is also highlighted by the recent waste and resource efficiency policies and strategies at EU and national levels. Measuring waste prevention is a complex task. Quantifying waste prevention is difficult since it often amounts to measuring what is not there. For that reason, waste generation related to demographics or economic activity, as well as waste generation as such are considered the closest approximation for measuring quantitative waste prevention. European economic production and consumption is apparently becoming less waste intensive, even after the economic downturn since 2008 is factored into the analysis. European trend, however, masks differing developments across European countries. Production activities In EU-28 and Norway nearly half of the total waste, excluding major mineral wastes, was generated by the manufacturing and services sectors in 2012, while their contribution to the total gross value added (GVA) was predominant. For both sectors, generation of waste declined in spite of increased economic output over the period 2004-2012 (Figure 1). The most notable decline in waste generation was observed in the manufacturing sector with 25% expressed in absolute terms. In the same period its economic output increased by 7%, with the largest increase in the information and communication sector. In the same period, economic output from the services sector increased by 13%, while waste generation declined by 23%, expressed in absolute terms. It is considered that the services sector is less waste intensive than the manufacturing sector on average. As the waste intensity of the service sector (0.014 kg/EUR in 2012) was lower than for the manufacturing sector (0.12 kg/EUR in 2012), a shift to the services sector in the economy is a contributor to less waste generation. This improvement might be due to a combination of various factors: efficiency improvements in production processes and management, changes in the structure of the manufacturing sector, increase in activities in services sector and a shift towards less-intensive waste generating activities. According to the recent Environmental Indicator Report, EEA, 2014, the structure of production in Europe has changed in large part due to a shift of industrial production to regions of the world with lower labour costs in the past two decades. Trade liberalisation combined with lower labour costs and less regulation in many developing countries can act as driving forces for a shift towards the production of goods consumed in Europe to other regions of the world. Some sectors, including the metals, telecommunications, electrical, textiles, food and chemical sectors have been particularly affected by relocations since 2000. This development might have added to the decline in waste generation. The share of services in the EU economy has increased, with the largest growth in the information and communication services sector. The Report also concludes that many environmental pressures within Europe are decreasing, which is partially associated to the more eco-efficient production, but partially to the fact that resource extraction and the manufacturing of many intermediate goods and final consumer products have relocated elsewhere. Consumption activities In EEA-33, excluding Liechtenstein, generation of municipal waste slightly declined by 2% between 2004 and 2012, despite an observed increase in household consumption expenditure of 7% in real terms (Figure 1). Generation of municipal waste was in continuous decline since 2007; showing absolute decoupling from household expenditure between 2009 and 2011. Behind the overall declining trend, there is large diversity between the EEA countries. Albeit temporary recovery of household consumption expenditure, generation of municipal waste continues to decline for more than 6% between 2007 and 2012. It would require much more detailed data to find out if waste prevention policies in the countries have contributed to the decline in waste generation. Some countries have achieved a stabilisation of waste generation or even a reduction, while others follow a constant increase. One of the objectives in EU waste policy is to reduce waste generation and to decouple waste generation from economic growth and environmental impact. Implementation of relevant EU policies in combination with improved waste prevention efforts across Europe seems to contribute to the waste objectives. Nevertheless, in-depth analysis across different economic sectors will be needed in order to provide more comprehensive understanding of the presented trends. Waste collection methods (e.g. change in national reporting method over time), might also have played a role when interpreting waste generation trends. Reporting systems need further harmonization in order to ensure the figures reported by countries are comparable."
"freshwater-quality-assessment-published-may-2  Freshwater quality     Concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and ammonium have markedly decreased in European rivers in the period 1992 to 2012, mainly due to a general improvement in waste water treatment.     Similarly, concentrations of phosphate in European rivers more than halved over the period 1992 to 2012. The decrease in river orthophosphate is due to the measures introduced by national and European legislation, in particular the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, which involves the removal of nutrients. Also the change to the use of phosphate-free detergents has contributed to lower phosphorus concentrations.   River nitrate concentrations have declined steadily from 2.7 to 2.1 mg N/l over the period 1992 to 2012. Agriculture is the largest contributor of nitrogen pollution, and due to the EU Nitrate Directive and national measures, the nitrogen pollution from agriculture has been reduced and this is reflected in lower river nitrate concentrations.      More than half of the river and lake water bodies in Europe are reported to be in less than good ecological status or potential, and will need mitigation and/or restoration measures to meet the Water Framework Directive objective of all water bodies having good status by 2015.        ecological potential ecological status freshwater quality lakes ammonium nitrate rivers bod phosphorus         SEBI SEBI016 016,Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and ammonium are key indicators of organic pollution in water. BOD shows how much dissolved oxygen is needed for the decomposition of organic matter present in water. Concentrations of these parameters normally increase as a result of organic pollution caused by discharges from waste water treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Severe organic pollution may lead to rapid de-oxygenation of river water, high concentrations of ammonia and the disappearance of fish and aquatic invertebrates. Some of the year-to-year variation can be explained by variations in precipitation and runoff. The most important sources of organic waste load are: household wastewater; industries such as the paper or food processing industry; and silage effluents and manure from agriculture. Increased industrial and agricultural production in most European countries after the 1940s, coupled with a greater share of population being connected to sewerage systems, initially resulted in increases in the discharge of organic waste into surface water. Over the past 20 to 30 years, however, the biological treatment (secondary treatment) of waste water has increased, and organic discharges have consequently decreased throughout Europe. See also CSI 024: Urban waste water treatment. In European rivers, the concentrations of oxygen demanding substances (BOD) have been decreasing throughout the period 1992 to 2012, in total, BOD concentration decreased by 1.6 mg/l from 1992 to 2012 (reduction of 2.9% per year). A significant decrease is evident at 62% of the more than 500 river stations, with an additional 6% of stations showing a marginally decreasing trend. On the other hand, a significantly increasing BOD trend has been recorded at just 3% of stations, with marginally increasing BOD at an additional 1% of stations. Over the 21 years from 1992 to 2012, the average ammonium concentration in European rivers decreased by 231 g N/l. The average yearly decrease is 11.6 g N/l (-3.5% per year). A significantly decreasingconcentration trend has been observed at 59% of the stations, with an additional 5% of stations showing a marginally decreasing trend, and only a few river stations showing an increasing ammonium concentration over the period 1992 to 2012. The decrease is mainly due to improved sewage treatment resulting from the implementation of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive and national legislation. The economic downturn of the 1990s in central and eastern European countries also contributed to this fall, as there is an ongoing decline in pollution from manufacturing industries. Further information is available in the Oxygen consuming substances in rivers (CSI 019/WAT 002) indicator. Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes.  Average concentrations of orthophosphate in European rivers have decreased markedly since 1992. At 52% of the river stations there has been a decline in orthophosphate concentration since 1992, while there has been an increase at only 9% of the stations. For lakes there has been a decline in total phosphorus concentrations since 1992 at 40% of the stations, while there has been an increase at 14% of the stations. This decrease reflects the success of legislative measures to reduce emissions of phosphorus such as those required by the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD) and a reduction in the phosphate content of detergents. At European level, river nitrate concentrations have declined steadily over the period 1992 to 2012. The trend is the same for the time period 2000 to 2012. Overall, there has been a decrease in river nitrate concentrations at 44% of the stations, while there has been an increase at 13% of the stations. Agriculture is the largest contributor of nitrogen pollution and, as a result of the EU Nitrate Directive and national measures, nitrogen pollution from agriculture has been reduced. This is reflected in lower river nitrate concentrations. Further information is available in the Nutrients in freshwater (CSI 020/WAT 003) indicator.  Ecological status or potential is an expression of the quality of the structure and functioning of surface water ecosystems. The main objective of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) states that all surface waters should be in good or high ecological status by 2015. The current status classification is the baseline from which the improvements objective of the WFD is measured. Overall, more than half of the total number of classified river and lake water bodies in Europe are reported to have less than good ecological status/potential. All these water bodies, therefore, need management measures to restore their ecological status or potential to fulfil the WFD objective. The number and percentage of water bodies in less than good ecological status or potential in different water categories is as follows (see also Fig. 2) rivers: 51 300 (56%) and lakes: 6 500 (44%).  The main reason that lakes are in a better condition than rivers is that about two thirds of the reported lake water bodies are in Sweden and Finland, where the population density and agricultural pressure is relatively low. However, lakes are also generally reported to have better status than rivers within EU Member States. The worst ecological status or potential in river and lake water bodies are reported in north-western Europe such as River Basin Districts (RBDs) in Northern Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium (Flanders), where more than 90% are reported to be in less than good ecological status or potential. Other problem areas are in Poland, southern Germany, Czech Republic, southern England, northern France and Hungary, as well as several single RBDs in other Member States, where 70-90% of freshwater bodies are reported to be in less than good status or potential. The pressures reported to affect most surface water bodies are pollution from diffuse sources, in particular agriculture, causing nutrient enrichment. Hydromorphological pressures also affect many surface water bodies resulting in altered habitats.  Further information on the state of Europe's freshwater can be found in SOER2015 Freshwater quality and SOER2015 Hydrological systems and sustainable water management.,Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and total ammonium concentration have decreased in European rivers over the period 1992 - 2005, corresponding to the general improvement in wastewater treatment. BOD and ammonium concentrations are generally highest in eastern, southern and south-eastern European rivers. The largest declines in BOD are evident in the rivers of western Europe, while the biggest drops in ammonium are apparent in eastern European countries. Concentrations of BOD and ammonium are key indicators of the organic matter and oxygen content of water bodies. They normally increase as a result of organic pollution due to discharges from waste water treatment plants, industrial effluent and agricultural run-off. Severe organic pollution may lead to rapid de-oxygenation of river water along with increased ammonium levels and the consequent disappearance of fish and aquatic invertebrates. The most important sources of organic waste load are household waste water, discharges from industries such as paper production or food processing and occasional silage or slurry effluents from agriculture. Increased industrial and agricultural production, coupled with a greater percentage of the population being connected to sewerage systems, initially resulted in increased discharge of organic waste into surface water across most European countries after the 1940s. Over the past 15 to 30 years, however, the biological treatment of waste water has increased and organic discharges have consequently decreased throughout Europe. Nutrient levels in freshwaters are decreasing. The average nitrate concentration in European rivers has decreased approximately 10 % since 1998, from 2.8 to 2.5 mg N/l, reflecting the effect of measures toreduce agricultural inputs of nitrate. Nitrate levels in lakes are in general much lower than in rivers but there has also been a 15 % reduction of the average concentration in lakes. Agriculture is the largest contributor of nitrogen pollution. Due to the EU Nitrate Directive and national measures the nitrogen pollution from agriculture has, however, been reduced in some regions during the last 10 - 15 years. European air emissions of nitrogen oxides have gone down by one-third over the last 15 years and the deposition of nitrogen on inland surface waters has also declined. Phosphorus concentrations in European rivers and lakes generally decreased during the last 14 years, reflecting the general improvement in wastewatertreatment and reduced phosphate content of detergents over this period. In many rivers the reduction started in the 1980s. During the past few decades there has also been a gradual fall in phosphorus concentrations in many European lakes. The decrease is due to nutrient removal measures introduced by national and European legislation particularly the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. As treatment of urban wastewater has improved and many waste water outlets have been diverted away from lakes, point-source pollution is gradually becoming less important. Agricultura linputs of phosphorus are still significant and need increased attention to achieve a good status in lakes and rivers. Improving groundwater quality is also important as it can be a source of nitrate in rivers thereby adversely affecting associated river systems, lakes, wetlands and dependent terrestrial ecosystems. At the European level, annual mean nitrate concentrations in groundwater have remained relatively stable since the mid-1990s following an increase during the first half of the 1990s.

"setting-the-scene  Setting the scene  soer2015 global megatrends     Why are global megatrends important for Europe?   Europe is bound to the rest of the world through multiple systems, enabling two-way flows of materials, financial resources, innovations and ideas. As a result, Europe's ecological and societal resilience will be significantly affected in coming decades by a variety of global megatrends  large-scale, high impact and often interdependent social, economic, political, environmental or technological changes. This report analyses 11 megatrends that are considered to be of key importance for Europe's long-term environmental outlook. It builds on the analysis initiated as part of the EEA's report  The European environment  state and outlook 2010  (SOER 2010; EEA, 2010).   Many global trends have significant consequences for Europe. For example, demographic, economic or geopolitical developments elsewhere can influence the availability and price of natural resources and energy in Europe. Increasing environmental pollution in other world regions likewise contributes to direct environmental and human harm in Europe. For instance, although European emissions of ozone precursor gases have declined significantly in recent decades, measured concentrations of ground-level ozone have not fallen at most ground monitoring stations (EEA, 2014a). There is evidence that this is partly due to the long-range transport of precursor gases from other parts of the world (HTAP, 2010).   Conversely, Europe contributes to environmental pressures in other parts of the world. Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe contribute to climate change impacts elsewhere and potentially far into the future. Globalised supply chains mean that European consumption contributes to pressures on ecosystems and communities in other areas of the globe, for example through threats to global freshwater quality and quantity, and the degradation of habitats and landscapes (Tukker et al., 2014).   This report explores how global developments may impact Europe, particularly the European Union (EU), and its environment. A global-to-European perspective is relevant for European environmental policymaking because Europe's systemic environmental challenges and response options are increasingly shaped by global drivers. Similarly to other advanced economies, Europe's relative size and influence on the global economy is expected to decline in coming decades. This changing global setting presents both challenges and opportunities.       The development of some global megatrends and related impacts over coming decades is becoming better understood. However, many uncertainties remain, associated with multiple drivers and change factors that unfold differently across world regions and over time. Global megatrends can also be perceived in contrasting ways by different societal groups and stakeholders. Continued global population growth, for example, can be seen as either a boost or a burden for economic development; urbanisation can be perceived as a source of growing pressures on ecosystems, or as an opportunity for more resource-efficient lifestyles.   These uncertainties notwithstanding, it is clear that 'business as usual' is no longer a viable development path for Europe. Current lifestyles in Europe and other developed regions put excessive pressures on the environment (Figure 0.1). Furthermore, as a growing global middle class increasingly adopts the resource-intensive consumption patterns of advanced economies, the total environmental burden is rapidly moving beyond globally sustainable limits (Rockstrm et al., 2009). This represents a growing threat to future advances in living standards and increasingly raises questions about the fairness of the wealthy imposing highly disproportionate burdens on the global ecosystem.   These trends underline the need for action to reconfigure systems of production and consumption so that they operate within planetary limits and thereby ensure the well-being of current and future generations. In Europe, as elsewhere, efforts to manage environmental pressures, economic development and human well-being need to overcome the short-termism currently dominating political and economic thinking and embrace long-term, integrated, global perspectives instead.       Figure 0.1:Correlation of ecological footprint (2008) and the human development index (2012)         Source:  Global Footprint Network, 2012; UNDP, 2014a.  National footprint accounts 2008 and Human Development Index (HDI)       Note: The Human Development Index is calculated using three components: education, life expectancy at birth and wealth. It is expressed as a value between 0 and 1, from less to most developed countries. The Ecological Footprint measures how much land and water area a population requires to produce the resources it consumes and to absorb its waste. The world biocapacity is the global productive area available on Earth (it decreases as population grows).     The next section aims to illustrate some of the ways that together the 11 global megatrends analysed in subsequent chapters of this report may impact Europe in coming decades, focusing on the ability of Europeans to meet their basic resource needs (Figure 0.2). The analysis is indicative rather than comprehensive, focusing on selected resources and assuming a business-as-usual situation based on current policies. It aims to trigger reflections on the possible implications of global megatrends for Europe.           Figure 0.2 Impacts of global megatrends on European resource systems               Source: EEA.                 The final section of this chapter identifies potential policy responses to influence the megatrends or manage their impacts on the European environment.   Implications of global megatrends for Europe's ability to meet its resource needs   The resources that societies rely on to meet their basic needs can be classified into four major categories: food, water, energy and materials (EEA, 2013b). In addition, ecosystems are essential to ensure the availability and quality of these resource categories, as well as providing a range of other ecosystem services that shape human health and well-being. The 11 megatrends differ in their impacts on the various resource categories, both in terms of their magnitude and the directness of their effects.   Food   Meat consumption is expected to increase by more than 70% globally between now and 2050 if current lifestyles and diet patterns remain unchanged (FAO, 2012b). Most of the increased demand is expected to occur outside Europe, and will strongly increase the pressure on global ecosystems through conversion of natural habitats into agricultural land. Conservative estimates suggest that global terrestrial biodiversity will decline by at least another 10% by 2050 (OECD, 2012b), and that soil degradation and water erosion will cause large-scale losses of valuable agricultural land. In addition, global food security is expected to be compromised by increasingly adverse impacts on agricultural yields from climate change and by increasing levels of pollution, the latter particularly in Asia.   Europe relies to a considerable extent on imports to meet domestic demand for food, in particular vegetables, fruit, seafood, coffee, tea and cocoa (Eurostat, 2011). The global developments described above could impact Europe directly through food-price increases or more indirectly through environment- and poverty-induced human immigration. These effects could be aggravated by interactions with other global megatrends. In particular climate change and the increasing global pollution load may adversely and directly impact the amount and quality of food produced on European territory.       Water   Globally, the availability of sufficient good-quality freshwater is increasingly threatened by population growth and increasing consumption, combined with adverse impacts from climate change (Murray et al., 2012). Even if water is used more efficiently, the absolute agricultural intensification needed to meet the world's growing food and feed demand could lead to severe water stress in many world regions in the coming decades (Pfister et al., 2011). Developments projected to occur outside Europe, such as strongly increased drought frequency due to climate change (for example in the Middle East and North Africa) or increasing levels of water pollution (for example in China), might be felt indirectly in Europe through price shifts and related economic impacts, or increased requests to contribute to large-scale international financial assistance.   Climate change and global pollution levels also exert direct pressures on European freshwater quantity and quality. Drought and resulting water scarcity related to climate change are expected to increase considerably in southern Europe, where 80% of national water abstraction is already used for agricultural irrigation (EEA, 2013b). In contrast, western and northern Europe are likely to face increased flood damage (Rojas et al., 2012). Moreover, the transboundary transport of pollutants emitted outside Europe is anticipated to play an increasing role in the future, with potentially adverse impacts for European freshwater quality, such as water acidification (HTAP, 2010).   Energy   As Europe is heavily dependent on fuel imports for its energy supply, its access to energy resources is significantly influenced by global population and economic trends. World energy demand is projected to increase by 3040% over the coming 20 years (IEA, 2013). Due to the globalised nature of energy resource flows combined with the prominent role of subsidies in the energy sector, changes in economic power blocs, trade agreements, or geopolitical conflicts are likely to have large impacts on Europe.   European energy supply is expected to be increasingly affected by climate change, for example by decreasing the availability of cooling water for nuclear generation due to longer periods with low river-flows and increased river water temperatures. The European energy system also has strong links with pressures on global ecosystems, in particular in relation to bioenergy production. Bioenergy-crop farming to meet renewable energy demands in developed countries, including in Europe, is one of the main drivers of habitat destruction and tropical deforestation, and its associated global water footprint is projected to increase tenfold by 2030 (Gerbens-Leenes et al., 2012). The expansion of bioenergy-crop production can create significant trade-offs and potential competition with increasing global food demand, as well as causing displacement and other social impacts on small-scale farmers in developing countries (German et al., 2011).       Materials   Global demand for materials has increased tenfold since 1900 (Krausmann et al., 2009), and is projected to double again by 2030 (SERI, 2013). Countries in developing regions, notably China and India, account for a rising proportion of global trade flows and material resource use. Growing global competition for resources represents a major concern for Europe since it is structurally dependent on imports for many key resources  for example 58% of metal ores consumed in the EU-28 in 2013 were imported.   There are particular concerns about access to certain 'critical raw materials', which have limited deposits in Europe or are absent altogether. World production of these materials is often monopolistic in character, with a single country, frequently China, in control of the global market. This raises concerns about future resource access and prices, in particular because global demand for materials such as niobium, gallium and other rare Earth metals is projected to grow by more than 8% annually in the coming five to ten years (EC, 2014d). Many emerging and prominent green technologies, including photovoltaics, wind turbines, hybrid and electric cars, are currently dependent on these critical raw materials. Access to certain materials could therefore have an important impact on the long-term transition of the European energy sector away from fossil fuel dependency (EC, 2014d).   Ecosystems   The interplay of environmental pressures from intensifying global use of food, water, energy and materials is apparent at the landscape scale. Models consistently project global ecosystem depletion and biodiversity loss to continue or accelerate under all existing policy scenarios (Leadley et al., 2010). Many people in developing countries rely heavily on their local environment to meet their basic needs (TEEB, 2010), meaning that continued ecosystem destruction could drive significantly increased migration. Ultimately, the destruction of ecosystems in other parts of the world is likely to increase the environmental pressure on European ecosystems.       More direct pressures on European ecosystem resilience derive from urbanisation, in particular from landscape fragmentation due to urban sprawl and expanding transport infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2006, industrial areas and infrastructure in Europe expanded by 45%, residential areas grew by 23%, but population increased by only 6% (EEA, 2013b). Moreover, European terrestrial ecosystems are expected to be increasingly affected by drought, wildfires, floods, glacier melt, or species extinctions due to climatic changes expected in the decades ahead. Marine ecosystems are projected to suffer from the combined effects from temperature increases, ocean acidification and sea level rise. Although significant reductions in European pollution levels have been achieved, severe problems persist, such as the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems due to high nutrient concentrations originating from sources such as agriculture and urban waste water systems.   Responding to global megatrends  challenges and opportunities for Europe   As the examples in the previous section illustrate, the boundaries between developments in Europe and other parts of the world are growing more blurred. Europeans are increasingly affected by changes in distant regions some very sudden, others unfolding over decades. Policy planning and strategic decision-making must, therefore, reflect the long-term and global contexts. That means finding ways to produce sufficient food, water, materials and energy to meet the needs of a growing global population, while maintaining ecosystem resilience and services.   Acknowledging the long-term and global context in strategic planning   Several recent global and European initiatives have embraced the need for long-term, global, and strategic risk assessment. For example, the European Strategy and Policy Analysis System (ESPAS) has assessed the long-term political and economic environment facing Europe over the next 20 years, and Europe's policy response options (ESPAS, 2012). It emphasised that Europe and the world are experiencing a period of accelerated change, in particular with respect to power, demographics, climate, urbanisation and technology.       Similarly, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has identified ten global risks of the highest concern for business. Four of these  concerning water, food, climate change responses and extreme weather events  relate directly to the environment (WEF, 2014). Environmental themes likewise appear prominently in the 17 proposed Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2014a) that have been drafted pursuant to the UN's Rio+20 outcome.   Increasingly, European strategic policy processes are also incorporating long-term and global perspectives. For example, to guide short- and medium-term actions, the EU's 7th Environment Action Programme (EU, 2013) sets out a 2050 vision that Europe should 'live well within the planet's ecological limits'. It acknowledges that 'global systemic trends and challenges, related to population dynamics, urbanisation, disease and pandemics, accelerating technological change and unsustainable economic growth add to the complexity of tackling environmental challenges and achieving long-term sustainable development'. It further recognises that 'many environmental challenges are global and can only be fully addressed through a comprehensive global approach'.   Two approaches to addressing global megatrends   Global megatrends are, by their nature, a manifestation of a vast number of processes and changes across the world. Faced with shifts of this character, Europeans have two main clusters of response options. First, they can seek to shape global change in ways that mitigate and manage risks, and create opportunities. This could be achieved, for example, through unilateral and multilateral efforts to mitigate environmental pressures or facilitate trade, or through using foreign aid mechanisms to invest in education and poverty alleviation.   Second, they can find ways to adapt to global trends. This could take the form of seeking to anticipate and avoid harm by increasing the resilience of social, environmental and economic systems. It could involve restoring damaged ecosystems or correcting social impacts that have already occurred. Or it could involve exploiting opportunities that arise as a result of the changes, such as the commercial opportunities associated with innovation, expanding global markets and prosperity.       European policy measures   These two clusters of responses are already emerging to some degree in recent European environmental policy initiatives, notably in efforts to increase resource efficiency and create a low-carbon society. The EU's Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011b) and its Roadmap for moving to a competitive low-carbon economy (EC, 2011a) include visions and targets stretching as far ahead as 2050, emphasising the need for long-term transformation of Europe's systems of production and consumption.   In accordance with these long-term goals, the EU's Raw Materials Initiative (EC, 2008, 2014b) and the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials (EC, 2012a) under the EU'sInnovation Union Flagship Initiative (EC, 2010a) aim to reduce the EU's import dependency by boosting resource efficiency, substitution and recycling. Efficiency improvements can augment Europe's economic resilience to global trends by lessening its vulnerability to uncertain supplies and volatile prices. At the same time, they can help mitigate Europe's contribution to escalating global resource demand; boost competitiveness by reducing production costs; and drive innovation in green sectors which are likely to grow in importance globally in coming decades.   Similarly, European climate and energy policy includes adaptation measures, such as the EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change (EC, 2013a), alongside efforts to enhance energy efficiency and mitigate carbon emissions both within Europe and across the world. The EU is a vigorous proponent of a robust global regime to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and has played a leading role through its emissions reductions pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol and its own unilateral targets for 2020 and 2030 (EC, 2009b, 2014a). Alongside these measures, European energy technology policy pursues a Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan) to accelerate the development of low carbon technology (EC, 2010b).   Policies also have an important role to play in financing the research and innovation needed to reconfigure European systems of production and consumption. With nearly EUR 80 billion of funding available over seven years  20142020, the EU's Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Horizon 2020) aims to foster scientific excellence and industrial leadership, and address societal challenges such as food security, climate action and resource efficiency (EC, 2015a).       Overcoming the gaps in global governance   While Europe has made some progress in enhancing resource efficiency and reducing environmental pressures, it is clear that individual governments or regional blocs face significant challenges in influencing global trends. As Held (2006) notes, 'the collective issues we must grapple with are of growing extensity and intensity and, yet, the means for addressing these are weak and incomplete'.   This observation certainly applies to management of the global environmental commons, for example in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or preserve public goods such as biodiversity and carbon sinks such as forests. But the same problem is also apparent in other areas requiring collective and collaborative global action, such as in meeting basic human needs by, for example, preventing poverty, conflict and global infectious diseases, and in enforcing global rules, for example regarding toxic waste disposal, intellectual property rights, regulation of finance and taxation of multinational companies. In essence, the globalisation of economic, social, technical and environmental flows has not been matched by the emergence of effective global governance mechanisms.   Strengthening global governance will partly require that governments reinforce rule-based forms of governance based on international institutions, laws and enforcement mechanisms. For Europe, obvious priorities in 2015 include the adoption of a robust global climate change agreement, and the Sustainable Development Goals as part of a post-2015 development agenda. There is also scope for the EU to extend the reach of its own regulations beyond Europe by taking advantage of commercial incentives for harmonisation of production standards across the world. This process is illustrated by the continuing adoption of EU 'Euro' emissions standards for road vehicles in Asian countries (EEA, 2014b) and the emulation of Europe's REACH legislation on chemicals in countries such as China (EC, 2006).       While regulatory and market-based tools have a clear role to play in addressing the challenges that have accompanied globalisation, decision-making processes at the global scale are frequently slow and complex, and enforcement mechanisms are often lacking. These limitations, as well as the opportunities presented by recent technological and social innovation, are driving the emergence of more participatory network governance approaches, based on more informal institutions and instruments. For example, non-governmental organisations and businesses play a growing role in developing, promoting and monitoring standards that influence the environmental and socio-economic impacts of production and consumption.   Crucially, responding to the weaknesses of governance across the world requires action at all scales  from intergovernmental processes to individual citizens. Cities and other subnational levels of government are increasingly engaged in cross-border networking and governance, as illustrated by the Covenant of Mayors (CM, 2014). Consumers and shareholders can also influence production practices across the world through their purchasing choices and investment decisions.   Enhancing the knowledge base to support transitions   Improving Europe's responses to global megatrends also depends on credible information on possible future developments and choices in the face of global risks and uncertainties. Better information is needed to mainstream long-term and global perspectives into policy. Increased use of foresight methods, such as horizon scanning, scenario development and visioning could strengthen long-term decision-making by bringing together different perspectives and disciplines, and developing systemic understanding. Impact assessments of the European Commission (EC, 2015b) and EU Member States, for example, could be enhanced if they were systematically required to consider the long-term global context.   Foresight methods could also enhance the usefulness of model-based quantitative projections and provide a platform for collaboration across government departments. Participatory approaches to scenario assessments could help increase the legitimacy and robustness of alternative options and pathways. Including forward-looking assessments and indicators in regular reporting on the state of the environment could likewise improve understanding of future trends and uncertainties.     Europe has many opportunities to improve the knowledge base for long- term decision-making and planning. In addition, a key condition for making better decisions under conditions of uncertainty is that robust information is complemented by appropriate political support and institutional capacity.   In times of economic and financial crisis, Europe should not lose sight of its long-term vision of 'living well within the planet's limits'. Investments aimed at economic recovery should be environmentally sustainable and should reflect the changing global context. As recently acknowledged by a Task Force on European investment potential, investing in areas such as resource efficiency, eco-innovation, the bio-economy and management of resource- and climate-related risks is critical for Europe's long-term growth prospects, contributing to competitiveness, prosperity and well-being (EC, 2014e)., Why are global megatrends important for Europe? Europe is bound to the rest of the world through multiple systems, enabling two-way flows of materials, financial resources, innovations and ideas. As a result, Europe's ecological and societal resilience will be significantly affected in coming decades by a variety of global megatrends  large-scale, high impact and often interdependent social, economic, political, environmental or technological changes. This report analyses 11 megatrends that are considered to be of key importance for Europe's long-term environmental outlook. It builds on the analysis initiated as part of the EEA's report The European environment  state and outlook 2010 (SOER 2010; EEA, 2010). Many global trends have significant consequences for Europe. For example, demographic, economic or geopolitical developments elsewhere can influence the availability and price of natural resources and energy in Europe. Increasing environmental pollution in other world regions likewise contributes to direct environmental and human harm in Europe. For instance, although European emissions of ozone precursor gases have declined significantly in recent decades, measured concentrations of ground-level ozone have not fallen at most ground monitoring stations (EEA, 2014a). There is evidence that this is partly due to the long-range transport of precursor gases from other parts of the world (HTAP, 2010). Conversely, Europe contributes to environmental pressures in other parts of the world. Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe contribute to climate change impacts elsewhere and potentially far into the future. Globalised supply chains mean that European consumption contributes to pressures on ecosystems and communities in other areas of the globe, for example through threats to global freshwater quality and quantity, and the degradation of habitats and landscapes (Tukker et al., 2014). This report explores how global developments may impact Europe, particularly the European Union (EU), and its environment. A global-to-European perspective is relevant for European environmental policymaking because Europe's systemic environmental challenges and response options are increasingly shaped by global drivers. Similarly to other advanced economies, Europe's relative size and influence on the global economy is expected to decline in coming decades. This changing global setting presents both challenges and opportunities.   The development of some global megatrends and related impacts over coming decades is becoming better understood. However, many uncertainties remain, associated with multiple drivers and change factors that unfold differently across world regions and over time. Global megatrends can also be perceived in contrasting ways by different societal groups and stakeholders. Continued global population growth, for example, can be seen as either a boost or a burden for economic development; urbanisation can be perceived as a source of growing pressures on ecosystems, or as an opportunity for more resource-efficient lifestyles. These uncertainties notwithstanding, it is clear that 'business as usual' is no longer a viable development path for Europe. Current lifestyles in Europe and other developed regions put excessive pressures on the environment (Figure 0.1). Furthermore, as a growing global middle class increasingly adopts the resource-intensive consumption patterns of advanced economies, the total environmental burden is rapidly moving beyond globally sustainable limits (Rockstrm et al., 2009). This represents a growing threat to future advances in living standards and increasingly raises questions about the fairness of the wealthy imposing highly disproportionate burdens on the global ecosystem. These trends underline the need for action to reconfigure systems of production and consumption so that they operate within planetary limits and thereby ensure the well-being of current and future generations. In Europe, as elsewhere, efforts to manage environmental pressures, economic development and human well-being need to overcome the short-termism currently dominating political and economic thinking and embrace long-term, integrated, global perspectives instead.   Figure 0.1:Correlation of ecological footprint (2008) and the human development index (2012)  Source: Global Footprint Network, 2012; UNDP, 2014a.National footprint accounts 2008andHuman Development Index (HDI)  Note: The Human Development Index is calculated using three components: education, life expectancy at birth and wealth. It is expressed as a value between 0 and 1, from less to most developed countries.The Ecological Footprint measures how much land and water area a population requires to produce the resources it consumes and to absorb its waste. The world biocapacity is the global productive area available on Earth (it decreases as population grows). The next section aims to illustrate some of the ways that together the 11 global megatrends analysed in subsequent chapters of this report may impact Europe in coming decades, focusing on the ability of Europeans to meet their basic resource needs (Figure 0.2). The analysis is indicative rather than comprehensive, focusing on selected resources and assuming a business-as-usual situation based on current policies. It aims to trigger reflections on the possible implications of global megatrends for Europe.    Figure 0.2 Impacts of global megatrends on European resource systems     Source: EEA.       The final section of this chapter identifies potential policy responses to influence the megatrends or manage their impacts on the European environment. Implications of global megatrends for Europe's ability to meet its resource needs The resources that societies rely on to meet their basic needs can be classified into four major categories: food, water, energy and materials (EEA, 2013b). In addition, ecosystems are essential to ensure the availability and quality of these resource categories, as well as providing a range of other ecosystem services that shape human health and well-being. The 11 megatrends differ in their impacts on the various resource categories, both in terms of their magnitude and the directness of their effects. Food Meat consumption is expected to increase by more than 70% globally between now and 2050 if current lifestyles and diet patterns remain unchanged (FAO, 2012b). Most of the increased demand is expected to occur outside Europe, and will strongly increase the pressure on global ecosystems through conversion of natural habitats into agricultural land. Conservative estimates suggest that global terrestrial biodiversity will decline by at least another 10% by 2050 (OECD, 2012b), and that soil degradation and water erosion will cause large-scale losses of valuable agricultural land. In addition, global food security is expected to be compromised by increasingly adverse impacts on agricultural yields from climate change and by increasing levels of pollution, the latter particularly in Asia. Europe relies to a considerable extent on imports to meet domestic demand for food, in particular vegetables, fruit, seafood, coffee, tea and cocoa (Eurostat, 2011). The global developments described above could impact Europe directly through food-price increases or more indirectly through environment- and poverty-induced human immigration. These effects could be aggravated by interactions with other global megatrends. In particular climate change and the increasing global pollution load may adversely and directly impact the amount and quality of food produced on European territory.   Water Globally, the availability of sufficient good-quality freshwater is increasingly threatened by population growth and increasing consumption, combined with adverse impacts from climate change (Murray et al., 2012). Even if water is used more efficiently, the absolute agricultural intensification needed to meet the world's growing food and feed demand could lead to severe water stress in many world regions in the coming decades (Pfister et al., 2011). Developments projected to occur outside Europe, such as strongly increased drought frequency due to climate change (for example in the Middle East and North Africa) or increasing levels of water pollution (for example in China), might be felt indirectly in Europe through price shifts and related economic impacts, or increased requests to contribute to large-scale international financial assistance. Climate change and global pollution levels also exert direct pressures on European freshwater quantity and quality. Drought and resulting water scarcity related to climate change are expected to increase considerably in southern Europe, where 80% of national water abstraction is already used for agricultural irrigation (EEA, 2013b). In contrast, western and northern Europe are likely to face increased flood damage (Rojas et al., 2012). Moreover, the transboundary transport of pollutants emitted outside Europe is anticipated to play an increasing role in the future, with potentially adverse impacts for European freshwater quality, such as water acidification (HTAP, 2010). Energy As Europe is heavily dependent on fuel imports for its energy supply, its access to energy resources is significantly influenced by global population and economic trends. World energy demand is projected to increase by 3040% over the coming 20 years (IEA, 2013). Due to the globalised nature of energy resource flows combined with the prominent role of subsidies in the energy sector, changes in economic power blocs, trade agreements, or geopolitical conflicts are likely to have large impacts on Europe. European energy supply is expected to be increasingly affected by climate change, for example by decreasing the availability of cooling water for nuclear generation due to longer periods with low river-flows and increased river water temperatures. The European energy system also has strong links with pressures on global ecosystems, in particular in relation to bioenergy production. Bioenergy-crop farming to meet renewable energy demands in developed countries, including in Europe, is one of the main drivers of habitat destruction and tropical deforestation, and its associated global water footprint is projected to increase tenfold by 2030 (Gerbens-Leenes et al., 2012). The expansion of bioenergy-crop production can create significant trade-offs and potential competition with increasing global food demand, as well as causing displacement and other social impacts on small-scale farmers in developing countries (German et al., 2011).   Materials Global demand for materials has increased tenfold since 1900 (Krausmann et al., 2009), and is projected to double again by 2030 (SERI, 2013). Countries in developing regions, notably China and India, account for a rising proportion of global trade flows and material resource use. Growing global competition for resources represents a major concern for Europe since it is structurally dependent on imports for many key resources  for example 58% of metal ores consumed in the EU-28 in 2013 were imported. There are particular concerns about access to certain 'critical raw materials', which have limited deposits in Europe or are absent altogether. World production of these materials is often monopolistic in character, with a single country, frequently China, in control of the global market. This raises concerns about future resource access and prices, in particular because global demand for materials such as niobium, gallium and other rare Earth metals is projected to grow by more than 8% annually in the coming five to ten years (EC, 2014d). Many emerging and prominent green technologies, including photovoltaics, wind turbines, hybrid and electric cars, are currently dependent on these critical raw materials. Access to certain materials could therefore have an important impact on the long-term transition of the European energy sector away from fossil fuel dependency (EC, 2014d). Ecosystems The interplay of environmental pressures from intensifying global use of food, water, energy and materials is apparent at the landscape scale. Models consistently project global ecosystem depletion and biodiversity loss to continue or accelerate under all existing policy scenarios (Leadley et al., 2010). Many people in developing countries rely heavily on their local environment to meet their basic needs (TEEB, 2010), meaning that continued ecosystem destruction could drive significantly increased migration. Ultimately, the destruction of ecosystems in other parts of the world is likely to increase the environmental pressure on European ecosystems.   More direct pressures on European ecosystem resilience derive from urbanisation, in particular from landscape fragmentation due to urban sprawl and expanding transport infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2006, industrial areas and infrastructure in Europe expanded by 45%, residential areas grew by 23%, but population increased by only 6% (EEA, 2013b). Moreover, European terrestrial ecosystems are expected to be increasingly affected by drought, wildfires, floods, glacier melt, or species extinctions due to climatic changes expected in the decades ahead. Marine ecosystems are projected to suffer from the combined effects from temperature increases, ocean acidification and sea level rise. Although significant reductions in European pollution levels have been achieved, severe problems persist, such as the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems due to high nutrient concentrations originating from sources such as agriculture and urban waste water systems. Responding to global megatrends  challenges and opportunities for Europe As the examples in the previous section illustrate, the boundaries between developments in Europe and other parts of the world are growing more blurred. Europeans are increasingly affected by changes in distant regions some very sudden, others unfolding over decades. Policy planning and strategic decision-making must, therefore, reflect the long-term and global contexts. That means finding ways to produce sufficient food, water, materials and energy to meet the needs of a growing global population, while maintaining ecosystem resilience and services. Acknowledging the long-term and global context in strategic planning Several recent global and European initiatives have embraced the need for long-term, global, and strategic risk assessment. For example, the European Strategy and Policy Analysis System (ESPAS) has assessed the long-term political and economic environment facing Europe over the next 20 years, and Europe's policy response options (ESPAS, 2012). It emphasised that Europe and the world are experiencing a period of accelerated change, in particular with respect to power, demographics, climate, urbanisation and technology.   Similarly, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has identified ten global risks of the highest concern for business. Four of these  concerning water, food, climate change responses and extreme weather events  relate directly to the environment (WEF, 2014). Environmental themes likewise appear prominently in the 17 proposed Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2014a) that have been drafted pursuant to the UN's Rio+20 outcome. Increasingly, European strategic policy processes are also incorporating long-term and global perspectives. For example, to guide short- and medium-term actions, the EU's 7th Environment Action Programme (EU, 2013) sets out a 2050 vision that Europe should 'live well within the planet's ecological limits'. It acknowledges that 'global systemic trends and challenges, related to population dynamics, urbanisation, disease and pandemics, accelerating technological change and unsustainable economic growth add to the complexity of tackling environmental challenges and achieving long-term sustainable development'. It further recognises that 'many environmental challenges are global and can only be fully addressed through a comprehensive global approach'. Two approaches to addressing global megatrends Global megatrends are, by their nature, a manifestation of a vast number of processes and changes across the world. Faced with shifts of this character, Europeans have two main clusters of response options. First, they can seek to shape global change in ways that mitigate and manage risks, and create opportunities. This could be achieved, for example, through unilateral and multilateral efforts to mitigate environmental pressures or facilitate trade, or through using foreign aid mechanisms to invest in education and poverty alleviation. Second, they can find ways to adapt to global trends. This could take the form of seeking to anticipate and avoid harm by increasing the resilience of social, environmental and economic systems. It could involve restoring damaged ecosystems or correcting social impacts that have already occurred. Or it could involve exploiting opportunities that arise as a result of the changes, such as the commercial opportunities associated with innovation, expanding global markets and prosperity.   European policy measures These two clusters of responses are already emerging to some degree in recent European environmental policy initiatives, notably in efforts to increase resource efficiency and create a low-carbon society. The EU's Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011b) and its Roadmap for moving to a competitive low-carbon economy (EC, 2011a) include visions and targets stretching as far ahead as 2050, emphasising the need for long-term transformation of Europe's systems of production and consumption. In accordance with these long-term goals, the EU's Raw Materials Initiative (EC, 2008, 2014b) and the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials (EC, 2012a) under the EU'sInnovation Union Flagship Initiative (EC, 2010a) aim to reduce the EU's import dependency by boosting resource efficiency, substitution and recycling. Efficiency improvements can augment Europe's economic resilience to global trends by lessening its vulnerability to uncertain supplies and volatile prices. At the same time, they can help mitigate Europe's contribution to escalating global resource demand; boost competitiveness by reducing production costs; and drive innovation in green sectors which are likely to grow in importance globally in coming decades. Similarly, European climate and energy policy includes adaptation measures, such as the EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change (EC, 2013a), alongside efforts to enhance energy efficiency and mitigate carbon emissions both within Europe and across the world. The EU is a vigorous proponent of a robust global regime to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and has played a leading role through its emissions reductions pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol and its own unilateral targets for 2020 and 2030 (EC, 2009b, 2014a). Alongside these measures, European energy technology policy pursues a Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan) to accelerate the development of low carbon technology (EC, 2010b). Policies also have an important role to play in financing the research and innovation needed to reconfigure European systems of production and consumption. With nearly EUR 80 billion of funding available over seven years  20142020, the EU's Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Horizon 2020) aims to foster scientific excellence and industrial leadership, and address societal challenges such as food security, climate action and resource efficiency (EC, 2015a).   Overcoming the gaps in global governance While Europe has made some progress in enhancing resource efficiency and reducing environmental pressures, it is clear that individual governments or regional blocs face significant challenges in influencing global trends. As Held (2006) notes, 'the collective issues we must grapple with are of growing extensity and intensity and, yet, the means for addressing these are weak and incomplete'. This observation certainly applies to management of the global environmental commons, for example in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or preserve public goods such as biodiversity and carbon sinks such as forests. But the same problem is also apparent in other areas requiring collective and collaborative global action, such as in meeting basic human needs by, for example, preventing poverty, conflict and global infectious diseases, and in enforcing global rules, for example regarding toxic waste disposal, intellectual property rights, regulation of finance and taxation of multinational companies. In essence, the globalisation of economic, social, technical and environmental flows has not been matched by the emergence of effective global governance mechanisms. Strengthening global governance will partly require that governments reinforce rule-based forms of governance based on international institutions, laws and enforcement mechanisms. For Europe, obvious priorities in 2015 include the adoption of a robust global climate change agreement, and the Sustainable Development Goals as part of a post-2015 development agenda. There is also scope for the EU to extend the reach of its own regulations beyond Europe by taking advantage of commercial incentives for harmonisation of production standards across the world. This process is illustrated by the continuing adoption of EU 'Euro' emissions standards for road vehicles in Asian countries (EEA, 2014b) and the emulation of Europe's REACH legislation on chemicals in countries such as China (EC, 2006).   While regulatory and market-based tools have a clear role to play in addressing the challenges that have accompanied globalisation, decision-making processes at the global scale are frequently slow and complex, and enforcement mechanisms are often lacking. These limitations, as well as the opportunities presented by recent technological and social innovation, are driving the emergence of more participatory network governance approaches, based on more informal institutions and instruments. For example, non-governmental organisations and businesses play a growing role in developing, promoting and monitoring standards that influence the environmental and socio-economic impacts of production and consumption. Crucially, responding to the weaknesses of governance across the world requires action at all scales  from intergovernmental processes to individual citizens. Cities and other subnational levels of government are increasingly engaged in cross-border networking and governance, as illustrated by the Covenant of Mayors (CM, 2014). Consumers and shareholders can also influence production practices across the world through their purchasing choices and investment decisions. Enhancing the knowledge base to support transitions Improving Europe's responses to global megatrends also depends on credible information on possible future developments and choices in the face of global risks and uncertainties. Better information is needed to mainstream long-term and global perspectives into policy. Increased use of foresight methods, such as horizon scanning, scenario development and visioning could strengthen long-term decision-making by bringing together different perspectives and disciplines, and developing systemic understanding. Impact assessments of the European Commission (EC, 2015b) and EU Member States, for example, could be enhanced if they were systematically required to consider the long-term global context. Foresight methods could also enhance the usefulness of model-based quantitative projections and provide a platform for collaboration across government departments. Participatory approaches to scenario assessments could help increase the legitimacy and robustness of alternative options and pathways. Including forward-looking assessments and indicators in regular reporting on the state of the environment could likewise improve understanding of future trends and uncertainties.  Europe has many opportunities to improve the knowledge base for long- term decision-making and planning. In addition, a key condition for making better decisions under conditions of uncertainty is that robust information is complemented by appropriate political support and institutional capacity. In times of economic and financial crisis, Europe should not lose sight of its long-term vision of 'living well within the planet's limits'. Investments aimed at economic recovery should be environmentally sustainable and should reflect the changing global context. As recently acknowledged by a Task Force on European investment potential, investing in areas such as resource efficiency, eco-innovation, the bio-economy and management of resource- and climate-related risks is critical for Europe's long-term growth prospects, contributing to competitiveness, prosperity and well-being (EC, 2014e)."
"oxygen-consuming-substances-in-rivers-7  Oxygen consuming substances in rivers   Concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total ammonium have decreased in European rivers in the period 1992 to 2012 (Fig. 1), mainly due to general improvement in waste water treatment.   soer2010 csi trend freshwater quality bod5 ammonium water rivers thematic assessments freshwater          CSI CSI019 WAT WAT002 019 002,Introduction Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and ammonium are key indicators of organic pollution in water. BOD shows how much dissolved oxygen is needed for the decomposition of organic matter present in water. Concentrations of these parameters normally increase as a result of organic pollution caused by discharges from waste water treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Severe organic pollution may lead to rapid de-oxygenation of river water, high concentration of ammonia and disappearance of fish and aquatic invertebrates. Some of the year-to-year variation can be explained by variation in precipitation and runoff. The most important sources of organic waste load are: household wastewater; industries, such as paper or food processing; and silage effluents and manure from agriculture. Increased industrial and agricultural production in most European countries after the 1940s, coupled with a greater share of the population connected to sewerage systems, initially resulted in increases in the discharge of organic waste into surface water. Over the past 15 to 30 years, however, the biological treatment (secondary treatment) of waste water has increased, and organic discharges have consequently decreased throughout Europe. See also CSI 024: Urban waste water treatment. Present concentrations per countrySee the WISE interactive maps for information displayed by countries on BOD in rivers and ammonium in riversIn 2012 (or the latest reported year), countries with an average BOD concentration in the lowest category (less than 1.4 mg/l) are Slovenia (1.0 mg/l), the United Kingdom (1.2 mg/l), France (1.3 mg/l) and Ireland (1.4 mg/l). In 2012 (or the latest reported year), countries with an average ammonium concentration in the lowest category (less than 40 g/l) are Norway (11 g/l), Finland (26 g/l), the United Kingdom (32 g/l), Sweden (39 g/l), Slovenia (40 g/l) and Ireland (40 g/l). Overall trend in BOD and total ammonium  In European rivers, oxygen demanding substances have been decreasing throughout the period 1992 to 2012 (Figure 2). Total BOD concentration decreased by 1.6 mg/l from 1992 to 2012. By using the filter in figure 2 the river BOD trends for the individual countries are illustrated. The average yearly decrease in BOD is 0.08 mg/l (-2.9 % per year). A significant decrease is evident at 62% of river stations, with an additional 6% of stations showing a marginally decreasing trend (see Rivers - BOD - statistical analysis). On the other hand, a significantly increasing BOD trend is recorded at only 3% of the stations, with marginally increasing BOD at an additional 1% of the stations. Countries where more than 60% of the stations show a negative trend in BOD concentrations are Ireland (100%), Luxembourg (100%), Slovenia (92%), Slovakia (87%), France (81%), the United Kingdom (75%), Denmark (74%), Austria (66%), Bulgaria (66%) and Lithuania (63%). Likewise, the relative trend calculation for ammonium shows that the average ammonium concentration decreased by 231 g N/l in the period 19922012 (Figure 3). By using the filter in figure 3, the river ammonium trends for the individual countries are illustrated. The average yearly decrease is in ammonium is 11.6 g N/l (-3.5 % per year). Significantly decreasing concentration trends have been observed at 59% of the stations, with an additional 5% of stations showing a marginally decreasing trend (see Rivers - ammonium - statistical analysis). A significantly increasing trend is evident at 3% of stations and a marginally increasing trend at 1% of stations. Countries where more than 60% of the stations show a negative trend in ammonium concentrations are Luxembourg, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Slovenia and the United Kingdom (all 100%), Germany (92.6%), Lithuania (88.5%), Ireland (75%), Poland (75%), France (71.7%), Bulgaria (71.6%), Belgium (70.4%), Norway (70%) and Austria (66%). The decrease is mainly due to improved sewage treatment resulting from the implementation of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive and national legislation. The economic downturn of the 1990s in central and eastern European countries also contributed to this fall, as there is an ongoing decline in pollution from manufacturing industries. This suggests that either further improvement in waste water treatment is required or that other sources of organic pollution, for example from agriculture, require greater attention, or both. BOD and total ammonium time series and trends per geographical region  Link: BOD concentrations in rivers in different geographical regions of Europe The largest absolute decrease of BOD from 1992 to 2012 has occurred in southeastern European rivers (61%), where concentrations are at their lowestlevel to-date. They are still, however, the highest in Europe (about 3.1 mg O2/l). The largest yearly decrease is evident in western Europe (3.4% per year). Concentrations in northern European rivers (represented by rivers of Finland only) are the most stable (less than 2 mg O2/l), with an average yearly decrease of 0.8%. The largest proportion of rivers with a negative BOD trend is in western Europe. Since BOD records are traditionally low in the north, the decreasing trends are less pronounced there. However, the share of rivers with an increasing trend is relatively high both in the north and the east. Link: Ammonium concentrations in rivers in different geographical regions of Europe The decreasing trend of ammonium from 1992 to 2012 is largest in southeastern (5.0 % per year on average) and western European (4.5 % per year on average) rivers. This is followed by a similarly decreasing trend in the eastern Europe (3.7 % per year on average). Concentrations in northern European rivers are stable, where the smallest decrease, of 1% per year on average, is observed. The concentrations in eastern European rivers, as assessed for the period 1992 to 2012 (around 80 g N/l), are significantly lower than those in the previous assessment (made in 2012, for the period 1992-2010: around 200 g N/l). The reason is that in the 1992 to 2010 assessment, data for 96 monitoring stations in Poland were included, whereas in the 1992 to 2012 assessment, only four stations in Poland were included. Monitoring stations in Poland had an important impact on the assessment of the indicator for the eastern European geographical region as a whole. The same difference can be observed for the southern European region due to the larger number of river monitoring stations in Spain, the only stations representing southern Europe (82% decrease in the 1992 to 2012 period, compared to a 20% decrease in the 1992 to 2010 period) included in the assessment. Southeastern and western European rivers also saw a significant decrease in ammonium concentrations (both around 75%), however, southeastern European rivers still have the highest ammonium concentrations in Europe (around 300 g N/l). BOD and total ammonium time series and trends per sea region Link: BOD concentrations in rivers in different sea regions of Europe The decreasing BOD trend is observed in all sea regions. It is largest in the Mediterranean Sea catchment, where it is decreasing on average by 4.4% per year. The decreasing trend is also strong in the Black Sea (3.6% per year on average), the Greater North Sea (including the Kattegat, and the English Channel; by 2.7% per year on average), and the Celtic Seas, Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast (by 2.8% per year on average). It is less pronounced in the Baltic Sea (by 0.9% per year on average). The present BOD is highest in the Black Sea (above 2 mg/l) and lowest in the Celtic Seas, Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast (less than 1.5 mg/l). Link: Ammonium concentrations in rivers in different sea regions of Europe Concentrations of ammonium in rivers are highest in the Black sea (142 g N/l) and the Greater North Sea regions (141 g N/l). Somewhat lower concentrations can be found in the Mediterranean Sea (134 g N/l). The Baltic Sea region has a lower record of 52 g N/l, while the Celtic Seas, Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast have 58 g N/l. The concentrations are by far the lowest in the region of the Arctic Ocean (5 g N/l). A trend comparison shows that concentrations are decreasing in all sea regions, with the largest decrease in the Celtic Seas, Bay of Biscay, Iberian Coast (5.7% average decrease per year), the Greater North Sea, including the Kattegat, and the English Channel (3.8%), the Black Sea (4.9%) and the Mediterranean Sea (3.5%). The decreasing trend is somewhat lower in catchments of the Baltic Sea (2.1% per year on average) and the Arctic Ocean (1.3%)."
"nutrients-in-freshwater-assessment-published-6  Nutrients in freshwater     Since 2005, average nitrate concentrations in European groundwater have declined and in 2011, the mean concentration had almost returned to the 1992 level.   The average nitrate concentration in European rivers declined by 0.03 milligrams per liter of nitrogen (mg N/l) (0.8%) per year over the period 1992 to 2012.   The decline in nitrate concentration reflects the effect of measures to reduce agricultural inputs of nitrate, as well as improvements in wastewater treatment.   Average orthophosphate concentration in European rivers has decreased markedly over the last two decades (0.003 milligrams per liter of phosphorous (mg P/l) or 2.1% per year).   Also, average lake phosphorus concentration decreased over the period 1992-2012 (0.0004 mg P/l, or 0.8% per year).   The decrease in phosphorus concentration reflects both improvements in wastewater treatment and the reduction of phosphorus in detergents.     soer2010 biodiversity csi nitrates trend nutrients phosphates freshwater quality orthophosphate lakes water rivers groundwater water quality nitrate thematic assessments freshwater total phosphorus phosphorus                   CSI CSI020 WAT WAT003 020 003,Present concentrations per country See also WISE interactive maps: Nitrates in groundwater by countries and WFD gw bodies Groundwater nitrate concentrations primarily reflect the relative proportion and intensity of agricultural activity. In 2012, 23 out of 32 countries had groundwater monitoring stations with an average concentration above the threshold Groundwater Quality Standard of 50 milligrammes of nitrate per litre (mg NO3/l) as laid down in the Groundwater Directive (2006/118/EC) [2]. Belgium and Spain had the highest proportion (more than 20%) of groundwater stations with an average concentration above the standard, but there was also a high proportion (10-20%) of groundwater stations above the standard in Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Montenegro, Netherlands and Portugal. Groundwater nitrate concentrations were generally low (most or all groundwater stations less than 10 mg NO3/l) in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Lithuania, Norway, Serbia, Sweden and the UK. Trends in groundwater nitrate concentration (see Fig. 2) There was a slight increase in average the annual mean nitrate concentration in European groundwater from 1992 to 1998. Since 2005, concentrations have declined again and in 2011, the mean concentration had almost returned to the 1992 level. By using the filter in figure 2, the groundwater nitrate trends for the individual countries are illustrated. Looking at individual groundwater bodies (GWBs) there is a wide variation in trends (see Groundwater - nitrate - statistical analysis), with 32% of the GWBs showing decreasing nitrate concentrations since 1992, while 28% of the GWBs showed increasing concentrations. The countries with the highest proportions of GWBs with significant decreasing trends were Netherlands, Portugal and Slovakia. These countries also had the largest annual decrease in concentrations. Geographical region time series and trends  Link: Nitrate concentrations in groundwater in different geographical regions of Europe There is marked variation in groundwater nitrate concentrations between different geographical regions of Europe. In Western Europe, the concentrations are high, and the levels have been fairly stable over the whole period, with similar proportions of decreasing and increasing trends, and about half the GWBs with no significant trend. The other regions are represented by far fewer GWBs. Results show that Northern Europe is at the other end of the scale, with low concentrations, but as for Western Europe, levels have been fairly stable over time. In Eastern Europe, the average concentration started declining after 1996, but increased again after 2003. However, since 2008, concentrations have declined, and have, since 2010, been at about the same level as at the start of the time series, and about 10 mg NO3/l lower than in Western and Southeastern Europe. In Southeastern Europe (only represented by Bulgaria), the concentration levels were high in the period 1997-2000. Disregarding this peak, there is still an overall increasing trend, with levels now higher than in Western Europe. However, as for Western Europe, the proportions of significantly increasing and decreasing trends were similar.,Nitrate in groundwater: There was a slight increase in average annual mean nitrate concentration in European groundwater from 1992-1998. Since 2005, the concentrations have declined again, and in 2011 the mean concentration had almost returned to the 1992 level. The shorter time series shows the same pattern, giving hardly any trend overall. However, this larger selection of groundwater bodies shows a somewhat higher average European concentration level.Nitrate in rivers: At European level, river nitrate concentrations have declined steadily over the period 1992-2012. The trend is the same for the time period 2000-2012, and the larger selection of stations shows a lower average concentration. Agriculture is the largest contributor of nitrogen pollution and, due to the EU Nitrate Directive and national measures, the nitrogen pollution from agriculture has been reduced in some regions over the last 10-15 years. This reduced pressure is reflected in lower river nitrate concentrations.Phosphorus in rivers. The average concentrations of orthophosphate in European rivers more than halved over the period 1992-2012. In many rivers the reduction started in the 1980s. The marked decline is evident also for the time period 2000-2012, but the average concentration is somewhat higher when including more river stations. The decrease in river orthophosphate is due to the measures introduced by national and European legislation, in particular the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive [1], which involves the removal of nutrients. Also, the switch to phosphate-free detergents has contributed to lower phosphorus concentrations.Phosphorus in lakes. During the past few decades, there has also been a gradual reduction in phosphorus concentrations in many European lakes. As treatment of urban waste water has improved, phosphorus in detergents is reduced, many waste water outlets have been diverted away from lakes and phosphorus pollution from point sources is gradually becoming less significant. However, diffuse runoff from agricultural land continues to be an important source of phosphorus in many European lakes. Moreover, phosphorus stored in sediment can keep lake concentrations high and prevent improvement of water quality despite a reduction in inputs.,Nitrate Present concentrations per country See WISE interactive maps: Nitrates in rivers Rivers draining land with intense agriculture or high population density generally have the highest nitrate concentrations. Rivers with nitrate concentrations exceeding 5.6 mg N/l in 2012 are found predominantly in northwest France, southeast United Kingdom and northern Spain. However, a high proportion (more than 20%) of rivers with concentrations exceeding 3.6 mg N/l are found in many other countries, particularly in Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Rivers in more sparsely populated or mountainous regions often have concentrations less than 0.8 mg N/l, e.g. Northern Europe, Scotland and Ireland, the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Apenninnes and the Massif Central, Corsica and large parts of the Balkans and Romania.Trends in nitrate concentration (Fig. 3) At European level, nitrate concentrations have declined steadily over the period 1992-2012. The trend is the same for the time period 2000-2012. Some of the year-to-year variation can be explained by variation in precipitation and runoff. By using the filter in figure 3, the river nitrate trends for the individual countries are illustrated.Overall there has been a decrease in river nitrate concentrations at 44% of the stations, while there has been an increase at 13% of the stations (see Rivers - nitrate - statistical analysis). The countries with the highest proportions of river stations with significant decreasing trends are Denmark and Germany. Denmark and Germany also had the largest annual decrease, along with Bulgaria and Latvia. Across Europe as a whole, there is a steady improvement in river nitrate concentrations, although it is still rather slow, reflecting the continued significance of agricultural nitrogen emissions.Geographical region time series and trends  Link: Nitrate concentrations in rivers in different geographical regions of Europe. There is a marked variation in river nitrate concentrations between regions, with western European rivers having 2-3 mg N/l higher concentrations than northern Europe, on average, and the remaining regions being somewhere in between. In eastern Europe there is hardly any trend, while nitrate concentrations are generally decreasing in the other regions (by 0.6%, 2.1% and 0.9% annually for northern, southeastern and Western Europe, respectively).Sea region time series and trends Link: Nitrate concentrations in rivers in different sea regions of Europe Nitrate concentrations in rivers vary markedly between the sea regions of Europe. The average nitrate concentration in rivers draining to the Greater North Sea is currently around 1-2 mg N/l higher than that in rivers feeding the Black Sea, the Celtic Seas, the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast, 2-3 mg N/l higher than the rivers feeding the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, and around 3.5 mg N/l higher than that of rivers draining to the Arctic Ocean. The difference compared to the other sea regions was even larger at the beginning of the time series.The Greater North Sea is the only sea region where there is a marked decreasing trend (0.05 mg N/l or 1.3% annual decrease and 60% strong declining trends). However, for the Arctic Ocean, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea regions there are markedly stronger decreasing than increasing trends, but here the number of stations with no or weak trends is larger. Phosphorus Present concentration per country. See also WISE interactive maps: Orthophosphate in rivers and Total phosphorus in lakes Relatively low concentrations of phosphorus in rivers and lakes are found in e.g. northern Europe (Norway, Sweden, and Finland), Scotland, Wales and Ireland, the western and French Pyrenees, large parts of southern France, the Alps, Corsica, and parts of the west Balkans and Romania, predominantly reflecting regions of low population density and/or high levels of wastewater collection and treatment. In contrast, relatively high concentrations (greater than 0.1 mg P/l) are found in several regions with high population densities and intensive agriculture, including: western Europe (south-eastern UK, Netherlands, Belgium, western Germany, northern France), southern Europe (north-eastern Spain and Italy, mid-Portugal), eastern and south-eastern Europe (Slovakia, Bulgaria, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Kosovo under UNSC Resolution 1244/99, Serbia, Turkey and parts of Romania). Given that phosphorus concentrations greater than 0.1-0.2 mg P/l are generally perceived to be sufficiently high to result in freshwater eutrophication, the observed high values in some regions of Europe are of particular concern.Trends in phosphorus concentration (see Fig. 4 and Fig. 5) Average concentrations of orthophosphate in European rivers have decreased markedly since 1992 (Fig. 4). Some of the year-to-year variation can be explained by variations in precipitation and runoff. At 52% of the river stations, there has been a decline in orthophosphate concentration since 1992, while there has been an increase at only 9% of the stations (see Rivers - phosphate - statistical analysis). For lakes, there has been a decline in total phosphorus concentrations, since 1992, at 40% of the stations, while there has been an increase at 14% of the stations (See Lakes - phosphorus - statistical analysis). By using the filter in figures 4 and 5, the river phosphate or lake phosphorus trends for the individual countries are illustrated. This decrease reflects the success of legislative measures to reduce emissions of phosphorus, such as those required by the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive [1] (UWWTD). The countries showing the strongest decreasing trends for lakes and/or rivers were Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. These are all countries with a large proportion of the population (more than 80%, except Latvia and Lithuania (70-80%)) connected to wastewater treatment (to a large extent tertiary), and with the exception of Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania and Switzerland, all these countries were supposed to comply with the UWWTD by 2005. There are also other countries with high treatment levels (all also with a compliance deadline in 2005), but where this has been the situation for some time, the expectation is for less of a trend in phosphorus concentrations (Finland, Sweden or where there are no consistent river or lake phosphorus data series Greece, Italy, Spain). Geographical region time series and trends  Link: Phosphorus concentrations in rivers (orthophosphate) in different geographical regions of Europe and Phosphorus concentrations in lakes (total phosphorus) in different geographical regions of Europe Northern Europe has markedly lower river orthophosphate concentrations than in the other regions of Europe. River orthophosphate concentrations have decreased in eastern and western Europe (48% and 66% decreasing trends, respectively). In northern Europe there have hardly been any changes, while in southeastern Europe the concentrations are highly variable, giving no clear trend overall. Lake total phosphorus shows a similar strong decrease for western Europe (54% strong decreasing trends), but the trend may be leveling out from 2005. There is virtually no trend in lake total phosphorus in northern and eastern Europe. Sea region time series and trends Link: Phosphorus concentrations in rivers (orthophosphate) in different sea regions of Europe Orthophosphate concentrations are generally lowest for rivers draining to the Baltic Sea and, in particular, the Arctic Ocean. For the other sea regions the concentration levels are currently fairly similar, but at the start of the time series, concentrations were highest for rivers draining to the Greater North Sea and the Celtic Seas, the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast. There are more strong decreasing than increasing trends in all regions except the Arctic Ocean, but the strongest decreasing trends are found in the Celtic Seas, the Bay of Biscay, the Iberian Coast and the Greater North Sea regions (73% and 54% strong decreasing trends, respectively).

"public-awareness-assessment-published-may-1  Public awareness   Understanding and awareness of biodiversity have increased slightly since 2007. Citizens are also more aware of the threats and challenges facing biodiversity, but change in levels of awareness is slow. In 2013, more than two-thirds of EU citizens had heard of biodiversity, but only 44% know the meaning of the word. This is, however, 10% more than in 2007.   62% of EU citizens (against 58% in 2010) very much agree that it is important to halt biodiversity loss because our well-being and quality of life is based upon nature and biodiversity (TNS, 2013).   biodiversity natura 2000  SEBI SEBI026 026,The latest Eurobarometer survey, published in 2013, showed that EU citizens are more aware of the term biodiversity and have better knowledge about biodiversity-related issues. 44% report having heard of the term biodiversity and know what it means, instead of 37% in 2010 and 35% in 2007. In 2013, only 26% had never heard of the term as opposed to 35% in 2007 (figure 1). This familiarity with the term biodiversity has increased in 18 Member States compared with the previous survey in 2010 (TNS, 2013). Nine in ten Europeans believe that the decline of forests, climate change, the endangering and disappearance of animals, the decline of natural habitats and the endangering of some plants are all serious problems (TNS, 2013). In 2013, 62% of EU citizens very much agreed that it is important to halt biodiversity loss because our well-being and quality of life is based upon nature and biodiversity. This proportion has increased slightly from 55% in 2007 to 58% in 2010 (TNS, 2013). 38% of people surveyed say they take personal action to try and combat biodiversity loss (TNS, 2013). The survey also reveals that most Europeans are unaware of what the EU is doing to save biodiversity: roughly three quarters of Europeans have not heard of the Natura 2000 network (73%). Only one in ten respondents (11%) have heard of the Natura 2000 network and know what it is, although this represents a slight increase over previous surveys (figure 2).  NOTES Flash Eurobarometer survey is part of a trend survey. Previous survey waves were published in 2010 and 2007 (Flash Eurobarometers No 290 and 219), and the current report presents comparative data between the three waves. In 2013, some 25 537 respondents from different social and demographic groups were interviewed, via telephone, in their mother tongue on behalf of the European Commission's DG Environment. Interviewees covered the population of the respective nationalities of the European Union Member States, resident in each of the 27 Member States and Croatia and aged 15 years and over. The basic sample design applied in all states is multi-stage random (probability).

"assessment-1  Forest: deadwood   Since 2000, an overall increase of deadwood has been observed in several countries, a sign of more biodiversity-friendly management practices, but also of large disturbances such as storms.   nature and biodiversity biodiversity deadwood forest    SEBI SEBI018 018,The quantity of deadwood in Europes forests has decreased significantly since the middle of the 19th century due to intense forest exploitation and the widespread burning of small wood and other debris. Since 2000, however, a small overall increase in this indicator has been observed (figure 1). This may be due to forest management practices that deliberately increase the amount of deadwood in managed forests either as a result of government policy or because of the establishment of requirements for forest certification. Large disturbances such as storms could also have contributed to the increase. Better reporting on deadwood must be noted, with 17 EEA countries providing data in 2010 against just eight in 1990. At national level, the average volume is variable across the European region (figure 2). Deadwood (coarse woody debris) is a proxy indicator for biodiversity, since it is a habitat for a wide array of organisms including vertebrates, invertebrates, lichens, bryophytes and fungi. Deadwood decomposition plays a key role in the recycling of nutrients and organic matter, as well as in providing a wide variety of (micro)habitats for plants and invertebrates, particularly insect species and other organisms. Deadwood in forests can be measured relatively easily. The amount of deadwood is thus a good indicator of the biodiversity value of a forest. Overall, deadwood in most European countries is nowadays generally low compared to natural conditions. However, many European countries have recently launched initiatives to increase the amount of deadwood, though not all increases are the result of biodiversity considerations. Disturbances such as storms, fires and insect outbreaks also produce deadwood. In some areas the accumulation of deadwood may not be desirable, for example where forest fires or the risk of insect pests (such as bark beetle plagues) is considered unacceptable, such as in Mediterranean coniferous plantations where deadwood must be removed to reduce the risk of fires. Although most countries legally require harvesting of extensive amounts of damaged trees, such as deadwood from recent storm damage, it has not been possible to completely remove the entire extent of deadwood produced by these disturbance events.

"forest-growing-stock-increment-and-4  Forest: growing stock, increment and fellings   The ratio of felling to increment is relatively stable and remains under 80% for most of the countries across Europe. This utilisation rate has allowed the forest stock to increase.   biodiversity nature and biodiversity forests forestry deadwood increment felling forest        SEBI SEBI017 017,The ratio of felling to increment is relatively stable and remains under 80% for most of the countries across Europe. This utilisation rate has allowed the forest stock to increase. As detailed in figure 1, the amount of wood felled has been less than that planted and added as incremental growth. This has allowed a build-up of the growing stock. The growing stock in Europe is increasing from a low level after clearances for agriculture and charcoal production in recent centuries. The area of forests in Europe probably reached its lowest level at the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th century. The ratio of felling to increment is expected to increase during the coming years. This is due to an expected increase in the demand for woody biomass as a renewable material energy source (Forest Europe, 2011). For 43 countries, growing stock and forest area were reported. The mean growing stock in Europe (excluding the Russian Federation) is 150 m3/ha, but it varies considerably between countries, from 15 m3/ha in Iceland to 346 m3/ha in Switzerland (Figure 2). High values can be explained mainly by ecological conditions in favour of tree growth, by the protection of forest areas, by silvicultural practices, and locally by forest harvesting difficulties (Forest Europe, 2011). This particular indicator addresses just one aspect of the sustainability of the forest sector. While maintaining felling below incremental production in the long run is a necessary condition for sustainability, from a biodiversity perspective it is not sufficient on its own. For a more comprehensive assessment, a complete set of forestry sector indicators is needed - such as the 35 indicators within six criteria used to report in the framework of Forest Europe. NOTES Growing stock is the stem volume of living trees."
"nationally-designated-protected-areas-assessment-3  Nationally designated protected areas   The total area of nationally-designated protected areas in Europe [1]  has increased over time and amounted to over 1,1 million square kilometres in 39 European countries in 2014. With more than 95 000 sites, Europe still has more protected areas than any other region in the world.   The total area of nationally designated protected areas currently covers about 21% of terrestrial territory and inland waters, although further expansion of the marine network is required to meet targets.       [1]  A Nationally designated area is an area designated by a national designation instrument based on national legislation. If a country has included the sites designated under the EU Birds and Habitats directive in its legislation, the Natura 2000 sites of this country are included in the figure.                    designated areas protected areas soer2015 cross-country comparisons soer2015 cdda biodiversity natura 2000       SEBI SEBI007 007,As shown in figure 1, the growth in nationally designated areas in 39 EEA countries has been exponential, even if it has been levelling off in recent years. The UN Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) 'Aichi'targets adopted in 2010 require countries to ensure that by 2020 at least 17% of their terrestrial and inland water areas and 10% of their coastal and marine areas (Aichi target 11) are conserved through a system of protected areas. In 2011, protected areas covered a relatively large part of Europe, with almost 21% of the EEA member countries and collaborating countries (EEA, 2012), so the region as a whole is in line with this target. However, designation of protected areas is not a guarantee of biodiversity protection. Therefore, beyond this quantitative analysis, specific information on site management and quality would help to complete the assessment of target 11. The expansion of protected areas and their role in protecting biodiversity have to be considered and assessed within the wider environment and in a climate change perspective. Europe has a high diversity of protected areas, which vary in size, aim and management approach. Analysis shows the most common IUCN categories of terrestrial protected areas amongst countries are national parks (designated as category II), habitat/species management areas (category IV) and protected landscapes/seascapes (category V). Categories IV and V are the most common marine protected areas (Figure 2). Europe has a large number but relatively small size of protected areas. Approximately 90% of sites are less than 1 000 hectares (ha). This reflects the high pressure on land use, arising from agriculture, transport and urban development. Large-scale nature reserves under category Ib and II occur mostly in countries with a low population density, such as Norway, Iceland, Finland and Sweden. It is difficult to compare other categories across countries because of the interpretation differences that exist. This is particularly true for category V, which comprises areas that are highly variable in character and management. The two most important European networks of protected areas areNatura 2000 and the Emerald Network. Natura 2000 covers 18% of Europe's land and 4% of its marine waters, with 52 million ha designated as Special Protected Areas (SPAs) under the Birds Directive and 65 million ha as Sites of Community Importance (SCIs) under the Habitats Directive.[4] The Emerald Network currently includes 37 sites designated by Switzerland, with Norway soon to add 600 sites. The degree of overlap between Natura 2000 and national designations illustrates the extent to which countries have made use of their nationally designated areas to underpin Natura 2000 and to what extent Natura 2000 sites extend beyond national systems. There are different patterns amongst countries, as some Natura 2000 sites nearly always overlap with national designations. In others, there is little overlap (Figure 3). Natura 2000 sites mostly overlap with nationally designated sites under IUCN categories I to IV, which aim to protect ecological processes and biodiversity. However, they also overlap with IUCN categories V and VI, particularly in mountainous regions, supporting the idea that Natura 2000 is not restricted to nature reserves but also serves the broader principle of conservation and sustainable use."
"assessment-1  Ecosystem coverage   Between 2000 and 2006 the highest absolute increase in ecosystem coverage occurred in transitional woodland, mostly at the expense of woodland and forest. A decrease was observed in vulnerable ecosystems such as wetlands, heathland and sparsely vegetated land. Agricultural land coverage also decreased, with the majority of changes caused by urbanisation and intensification of agriculture, affecting, particularly, grassland and agricultural mosaics. Urban areas continued to increase dramatically. Rivers, lakes and coastal areas increased to a minor extent.      land cover ecosystem biodiversity   SEBI SEBI004 004,Figure 1 shows changes in land cover between 2000 and 2006. The largest absolute changes occurred between forests and transitional woodland with a net decrease of forest of more than 2 million hectares. These changes are caused either by the lack of traditional management activities or natural disasters like fire, wind or pest outbreaks. The majority of changes observed on agricultural land were due to urbanisation and particularly affected grassland and agricultural mosaics. The highest rates of abandonment of land can be observed for grasslands. The shifts between the agricultural ecosystems show the ongoing intensification process. Grasslands were losing against all other agricultural ecosystems and agricultural mosaics were transformed into cropland. The dominant change process is still urbanisation, similar to the 1990-2000 period (Figure 2). More than 110 000 hectares per year were converted into urban land. This occurred mainly on agricultural land (>75%). Croplandcontributes the highest share (45%) to newly developed urban land. The highest net losses (besides forest) still occur in one of the most vulnerable ecosystems  the inland wetlands (mire, bog and fens) (Figure 3). The major change (>85%) happened as conversion into transitional woodland (almost 50%) or conversion into cropland (36%). The total gain for cropland is minor compared to total stocks of cropland, but the loss for inland wetlands is substantial."
"abundance-and-distribution-of-selected-2  Abundance and distribution of selected species   Since 1990, common bird populations have decreased by around 12% in 27 European countries. The decline of common farmland birds was more pronounced at 30%, whereas common forest birds declined by 8%.   Grassland butterflies have also declined dramatically (50%) since 1990 in 19 European countries and this reduction shows no sign of levelling off.   biodiversity soer2015 population trends butterflies biodiversity components birds soer2015 european       SEBI SEBI001 CSI CSI050 001 050,Despite a slow levelling off of the downward trend in bird populations, populations of all common birds in Europe, including common farmland and forest species, (Fig. 1) have declined since 1990. It should be borne in mind, however, that significant losses had already happened before this date. The initial steeper decline in farmland bird populations was associated with increasing agricultural specialisation and intensity in some areas, and large-scale marginalisation and land abandonment in others. The challenge now is to deploy the Birds Directive conservation measures, amongst others, widely enough to help populations recover on national and European scales.    In spite of year-to-year fluctuations, grassland butterflies are declining severely; their populations have decreased by 50% and there is no sign of levelling off, indicating a dramatic loss of grassland biodiversity (figure 2). The main driver behind the decline of grassland butterflies is the change in rural land use: agricultural intensification where the land is relatively flat and easy to cultivate, abandonment in mountains and wet areas - mainly in Eastern and Southern Europe. Agricultural intensification leads to uniform grasslands, where the management is so intensive that grassland butterflies can only survive in traditionally farmed low-input systems, as well as in nature reserves and marginal land such as road verges and amenity areas (EEA, 2013).     NOTES An increase in the population index means that there are more species with increased populations than those with decreased populations: it does not necessarily mean that the population of all species has increased. This situation may be due to an expansion of some species (typically, generalists) at the expense of other species (typically, specialists). It must also be noted that populations fluctuate on a yearly basis. In the absence of information on abundance, information on the distribution of species can help assess species status. However, at European level, this type of information is still weak for other groups of species. FURTHER INFORMATION  European Bird Census Council (EBCC): www.ebcc.info.

"future-prosperity-depends-on-bolder  Europe's environment 2015: Future prosperity depends on bolder steps in policy, knowledge, investments and innovation  soer soer2015 state of the environment natural capital sustainability resource efficiency health transitions         Europe's environment and climate policies have delivered substantial benefits, improving the environment and quality of life, while driving innovation, job creation and growth. Despite these gains, Europe still faces a range of persistent and growing environmental challenges. Addressing them will require fundamental changes in the systems of production and consumption that are the root cause of environmental problems.    These are some of the key messages from the European Environment Agency's five-yearly assessment ' The European environment – state and outlook 2015 ' (SOER 2015), published today. SOER 2015 is an integrated assessment of Europe's environment. It also includes assessments and data at global, regional and country levels, as well as cross-country comparisons.   EU policies have delivered substantial benefits   Today, Europeans enjoy cleaner air and water, less waste is sent to landfill and more resources are recycled. However, Europe remains a long way from achieving the objective of 'living well within the limits of the planet' by 2050, as set out in the  7th Environment Action Programme . Although we use natural resources more efficiently than previously, we are still degrading the resource base that we rely on in Europe and across the world. Problems such as biodiversity loss and climate change remain major threats.   Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: 'Our analysis shows that European policies have successfully tackled many environmental challenges over the years. But it also shows that we continue to harm the natural systems that sustain our prosperity. While living within planetary limits is an immense challenge, there are huge benefits in responding to it. Fully using Europe's capacity to innovate could make us truly sustainable and put us at the frontier of science and technology, creating new industries and a healthier society.'   SOER 2015 highlights the need for more ambitious policies to achieve Europe's 2050 vision. It also stresses the need for new approaches that respond to the systemic nature of many environmental problems. For example, external pressures, including global megatrends, can counteract specific policies and local environmental management efforts. In addition, many environmental challenges are closely linked to systems of production and consumption that support numerous jobs and livelihoods and changes to these systems create diverse costs and benefits. Moreover, efficiency improvements are often negated by increased consumption.   The report concludes that although full implementation of existing policies will be essential, neither the environmental policies currently in place, nor economic and technology-driven efficiency gains, will be sufficient to achieve Europe's 2050 vision.   Need to transform key systems   Addressing the complex challenges facing Europe will require more ambitious policies, alongside better knowledge and smarter investments, aimed at fundamentally transforming key systems such as food, energy, housing, transport, finance, health and education. It will necessitate strategies and approaches aimed at mitigating pressures and avoiding potential harm, restoring ecosystems, correcting socio-economic inequities, and adapting to global trends such as climate change and resource depletion.   Dr Bruyninckx continued: 'We have 35 years to ensure that we live on a sustainable planet by 2050. This may seem like a distant future, but to achieve our goal, we need to act now. We need our actions and investments to be even more ambitious and more coherent. Many of the decisions we make today will determine how we are going to live in 2050.'    SOER 2015: selected facts and trends    Natural capital     EU policies have reduced pollution and have significantly improved the quality of Europe's air and water. However, continued ecosystem degradation threatens Europe's economic output and well-being.    Biodiversity continues to be eroded. Sixty percent of protected species assessments and 77% of habitat assessments recorded an unfavourable conservation status. Europe is not on track to meet its 2020 target of halting biodiversity loss.    Fresh water quality has improved over recent years, however, around half of Europe's freshwater bodies are unlikely to attain 'good ecological status' in 2015.   Marine and coastal biodiversity is a particular area of concern. Pressures include sea floor damage, pollution, invasive alien species and acidification. Overfishing has decreased in the Atlantic and Baltic, but the Mediterranean shows a more negative picture, with 91% of assessed stocks overfished in 2014.   Less than 6% of Europe's farmed area was used for organic agriculture in 2012, with large differences between countries.   Looking ahead, climate change impacts are projected to intensify pressures and impacts and the underlying drivers of biodiversity loss are expected to persist.     Resource efficiency      Domestic resource consumption was 16.7 tonnes per person in 2007, declining to 13.7 tonnes in 2012, partly due to the collapse of the construction industry in some countries.    Waste management has improved in recent years, with less waste generated and less waste sent to landfill. Recycling rates increased in 21 countries between 2004 and 2012, while landfilling rates decreased in 27 out of 31 countries (for which data are available). EEA countries achieved an average recycling rate of 29% in 2012, compared to 22% in 2004.   Greenhouse gas emissions have decreased by 19% since 1990 despite a 45% increase in economic output. Fossil fuel use has declined, as have emissions of some pollutants from transport and industry.   The 2008 financial crisis and subsequent economic difficulties also contributed to the reductions in some environmental pressures. It remains to be seen whether improvements will be sustained.   Currently agreed policies are not sufficient for Europe to achieve its long-term environmental goals, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95%.        Health and well-being      Environmental policies have brought improvements in drinking water and bathing water quality, and have reduced exposure to key hazardous pollutants.    Air and noise pollution continue to cause serious health impacts in urban areas. In 2011, about 430 000 premature deaths in the EU were attributed to fine particulate matter while noise exposure contributes to at least 10 000 premature deaths due to heart disease each year.   The growing use of chemicals, particularly in consumer products, has been associated with an observed increase of endocrine diseases and disorders in humans.   Projected improvements in air quality are not expected to be sufficient to prevent continuing harm, while impacts resulting from climate change are expected to worsen.   The environment industry sector grew by more than 50% from 2000 to 2011, and is one of the few sectors to have flourished in terms of revenues and jobs since the 2008 financial crisis.        Notes to the editor   About the EEA    The European Environment Agency (EEA) is an agency of the European Union.

In addition, several international organisations have been involved in the peer review of the assessment. "
"trade  An increasingly multipolar world (GMT 6)  global megatrends global governance developing countries economic growth      Drivers   Structural convergence   Globally, economic power is shifting. Due to contrasting rates of growth, developing regions are gaining in importance and developed regions are becoming less dominant. These trends are linked to the process of structural economic development: the transition from agrarian societies, through industrialisation to service-based and knowledge economies.   In developed regions,  industrialisation  in the 19th and 20th centuries brought an unprecedented increase in economic output. Today, developing regions are undergoing the same transition but at much faster rates because they have been able to import and adapt existing approaches. In some countries, the process is already advanced; in 2012, the economic structure of East Asia and the Pacific was similar to the EUs in 1970 (Figure 1).   Figure 1: Structural breakdown of economic output in selected regions, 1970 and 2012 [2]           Data sources: World Bank World Development Indicators -  [a] ,  [b] and [c]  Note:  The graphs shows the contribution of service, industry and agriculture to aggregate economic output. The composition of regional groupings corresponds to World Bank definitions.  [3]     In contrast to the rapid growth in developing regions, structural and demographic factors have slowed growth in the advanced economies. The increasing contribution of services to economic output is important, since many branches of the service sector deliver modest productivity growth. [1] At the same time, lower birth rates mean that populations in many developed countries have stopped growing or started contracting, and labour forces are expected to decline further as the population ages ( GMT 1 ).   Factors affecting convergence   Trade liberalisation has contributed to the rebalancing of global economic output. Access to export markets promotes structural economic change because national production is no longer limited by domestic demand. Instead, a country can expand output of goods or services that it can produce relatively cheaply, thereby boosting aggregate productivity. In developing countries, that often means increasing labour-intensive manufacturing.   The average level of tariffs on manufactured products in industrialised countries has dropped from 4550 % in 1948 to an average of about 3 % in 2009. [4]  World exports grew at an average rate of 7.9% per year between 1990 and 2011, while global gross domestic product (GDP) increased by about 5.5 % (in nominal terms) annually. [2]    Foreign direct investment (FDI) also contributes to structural change because, in addition to financing accumulation of productive capital, it is associated with the diffusion of technologies, skills, institutions and management expertise. [5]  Some developing countries have facilitated technology transfer and the transition to post-industrial economic structures though major investments in education and health ( GMT 2 ).   While the processes of socio-economic development tend to cause economic productivity to converge across the globe, there are many uncertainties. Socio-political developments within  developing countries  for example democratic processes and growing income disparities  are very hard to anticipate, as are the effects of shortages of skilled labour due to demographic changes  migration and ageing, for example. In terms of international relations, uncertainty surrounds the ability of emerging countries to develop economic cooperation mechanisms. Perhaps most important are the risks of geopolitical instability and military conflict.   Trends   Declining dominance of advanced economies   Projections of global GDP underline the increased economic significance of today's developing and emerging economies. In 2000, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries accounted for less than 20 % of the global population but 77 % of its economic output, but this is projected to fall to 50 % in 2030 and 42 % in 2050 (Figure 2). The EUs share is projected to drop by around half between 2000 and 2050, falling from 28 % to 14 %. [6]    In the short term, the financial crisis and subsequent economic stagnation in advanced economies has accelerated the global convergence of living standards ( GMT 1 ). Even when steady growth returns to the EU, it is projected to be modest compared to the expansion in developing regions. By 2017, China is expected to have the world's largest economy, in purchasing-power parity (PPP) terms, although its share of global GDP is expected to wane slightly after 2045. India is likely to achieve similar growth, though from a significantly lower base, with its share of global economic output projected to rise from 4.3 % in 2000 to 18 % in 2050. [6]       Figure 2: Contribution of major economies to global GDP, 19962050 [6]            Source:  OECD Long-term Baseline Projections 2014      Trade and investment   The increasing importance of emerging countries is also apparent in world trade, with the larger advanced economies becoming less dominant in the three decades up to 2012 and China, in particular, emerging as a major exporter. Excluding intra-EU trade, the EU accounted for 15.4 % of global merchandise imports in 2012 and 14.7 % of exports. [7]  These figures were comparable to the contributions of the US (12.5 % of imports and 8.4 % of exports) and China (9.8 % of imports and 11.1 % of exports). In general, external trade plays a large role in the economic output of the emerging economies, since  agriculture  and manufactured goods are more easily traded than services.   Looking ahead, global trade flows are likely to continue evolving. There are also some indications that rising wages in China are weakening its competitive advantage in some sectors. Some labour-intensive manufacturing industries have already relocated to other Asian countries and more are likely to follow. [8][9]  So, while Chinas trade is likely to increase in absolute terms in coming decades, other countries may displace it in certain sectors.   The global economy has also become more balanced in recent decades in terms of investment flows. Foreign direct investment has expanded enormously, from 0.4 % of world GDP in the 1970s to 2.6 % in the 2000s. At the same time, advanced economies have become less dominant, with the combined contribution to global FDI of the US, EU-27, EFTA and Japan declining from almost 100 % in the early 1970s to 60 % in 2012. Motivated by a desire to secure access to resources, technologies, expertise and brands, [10]  Chinas outward investment has grown enormously in recent years, accounting for 12.1 % of global FDI in 2012.   Implications   Economic risks and opportunities for developed regions   Emerging economies have competitive advantages in low-skilled, labour-intensive production. This creates a competitive challenge for advanced economies, putting downward pressure on wages for low-skilled workers in Europe and other developed countries. [11]    At the same time, however, increasing prosperity in developing regions potentially offers a growing, wealthy customer base for exports in areas of European specialisation, such as scientific innovation and luxury brands. The global middle class defined as households with daily available funds of USD 10100 (PPP) per person  is projected to increase from 27 % of the world population of 6.8billion in 2009 to 58 % of more than 8.4 billion in 2030 ( GMT 2 ). The Asia-Pacific region is projected to provide much of this growth, accounting for 66 % of the total world middle-class population in 2030, up from 28 % in 2009. [12]  In addition to changing  consumption patterns , this is likely to bring with it evolving norms, attitudes and expectations, with potentially far-reaching implications for social cohesion and political systems. [13]    In the long term, continued economic progress in developing regions may cause their cost advantages to disappear, ultimately leading to the repatriation ('back-sourcing') of some production to today's advanced economies. Although these changes will expose advanced economies to increasing competition in areas in which they currently dominate, such as high-tech industries or financial services, the restructuring of emerging economies towards largely non-traded services as they become wealthier may alleviate some competitive pressure.   New actors and new challenges in global governance   Until relatively recently, coordination of the international economy was largely handled by the small group of structurally similar states that accounted for most global production. The financial crisis of 2008 exposed a changing reality. Today, choices by large emerging economies for example relating to the accumulation of foreign currency reserves can have major effects on the entire global economy.   The decline of the G7/G8 and the emergence of the G20 as the locus of global economic planning reflect this transition. Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, South Korea and Turkey, for example, now have a more important role in global  governance . China and India are already major economic powers with related global social and environmental impacts and responsibilities. Yet they have acquired this status when their average per person income levels are quite low. They therefore face a set of internal development challenges and demands that are quite different from advanced economies. [14]    The systemic importance of large emerging economies means that their engagement in international economic governance is essential. But the growing number and diversity of participants are also likely to make it harder to coordinate global activities and ensure economic stability. The EU will remain a powerful voice in these processes but its capacity to control external risks may decline.   The need for coordinated environmental governance is also growing as economic and social interactions intensify. Globalisation of trade flows has created economic benefits for exporting and importing countries but it also means that consumers are extremely unlikely to comprehend the full social and environmental implications of their purchases. National governments have very limited capacity to monitor or manage such impacts, in part because the international agreements that facilitate global trade prevent states from differentiating between imports based on production methods. [15]    To some extent, the harm associated with globalised supply chains may abate as growing prosperity in developing regions brings popular demand for improved local environmental and social protection. However, such advances may do little to curb pressures on the global environmental commons. At present, therefore, the international community lacks effective institutions to coordinate its response to complex globalised challenges such as   climate change   and international financial instability. This is creating demand for new forms of governance (  GMT 11  ).,Drivers Structural convergence Globally, economic power is shifting.

This is creating demand for new forms of governance (GMT 11)."
"ecosystems  Growing pressures on ecosystems (GMT 8)  global megatrends global pressures ecosystem services global global impacts       Drivers   Population, consumption, and economic growth   The past five decades have seen a rise in the global population to more than 7 billion people, and a concomitant industrialisation of agriculture ( GMT 1 ). [1]  About 2 % of the global land area is currently covered by cities and infrastructures. [2]  However, continued population growth and urbanisation ( GMT 2 ) might cause this to double by 2050. [2]  In addition, continued global economic growth ( GMT 5 ), accompanied by a rapidly growing global middle class  with resource-intensive, developed-world mobility and consumption patterns ( GMT 2 )  is likely to increase pressure on habitats and landscapes, particularly in regions with a high and direct dependence on natural resources for economic development, such as sub-Saharan Africa. [3]    Food and bioenergy   Dietary changes might override population growth as the major driver of global demand for land in the near future. [5]  Meat-based food requires about five times as much land per unit of nutritional value as its plant-based equivalent, [6]  and also has a higher water footprint which is, on average, 20 times higher for beef than for cereals. [7] Since the 1960s, global average meat consumption has almost doubled, from 23 kg per person to 42 kg, with the highest consumption in the US and Europe, while China and Brazil have recorded significant increases in the last 2030 years. [8]  Estimates suggest that global annual demand for meat products may increase by a further 76 % relative to 2005 to 455 million tonnes in 2050. [9]    A rapid expansion in land allocated to cultivating bioenergy crops ( GMT 7 ) could have significant ecological impacts, such as deforestation, nitrogen pollution ( GMT 10 ) and freshwater scarcity  the water footprint associated with bioenergy crops might increase ten-fold in the period 20052030. [10]  Mitigating associated pressures on ecosystems will depend on the development of bioenergy produced from agricultural and forestry residues that do not require additional land. [11]    Increases in crop yields due to efficiency gains are unlikely to compensate for the growing demand for both plant- and animal-based food, and  bioenergy . This could lead to a large-scale expansion of cropland, mostly at the expense of forest and grassland ecosystems, of 120500 Mha (million hectares) by 2050 on top of the current 1500 Mha of global cropland  10 % of the global land area. Furthermore, if loss of productive land to severe soil degradation and conversion to built-up areas is taken into account, cropland expansion could reach 850 Mha by 2050. [2]    Competition for land and water   Growing global competition for productive land and freshwater resources is apparent in the recent rapid increase in large-scale transnational land acquisitions, mostly in developing countries (Figure 1). Between 2005 and 2009, global land acquisitions by foreign investors totalled some 47 Mha, [12]  slightly more than the area of Sweden. As a consequence, large-scale commercial farming is expanding at the expense of smallholder farmers and their access to land and water - in particular in Africa and parts of Asia.   Population growth, demand for food and  climate change  are expected to create significant threats to freshwater availability. [13] Scenarios on global food demand for 2050 point to severe water stress in many regions, even if strong efficiency gains in its use are made. [14]  This implies a threat to both human water security and to the functioning of  ecosystems . Already today, around half of the world's major river basins, home to 2.7billion people, face water scarcity in at least one month a year, [15]  and water restrictions are projected to be further amplified by climate change ( GMT 9 ).   Figure 1: Transnational land acquisitions, 2005-2009 [12]           Data sources: Rulli et al., 2013 -  [a] and  [b]    Note:Please read reference  [16]  for additional information.    Trends   Terrestrial biodiversity   Some scenarios, including from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), consistently project a continued decrease of global biodiversity [3] (Figure 2). Towards the mid-21st century, habitat loss due to bioenergy-crop farming and climate change is expected to gain in significance as drivers of decrease. [3][17]  In a business-as-usual scenario for 2050, global terrestrial biodiversity measured as mean species abundance(MSA) is projected to decline further: from 68 % of the level that potential natural vegetation could support in 2010 to around 60 % in 2050. Strong losses may occur in, for example, in Japan/Korea, Europe, southern Africa, and Indonesia (Figure 2). These estimates may be conservative, as they exclude risks associated with transgressing possible ecosystem thresholds (Box 1) and the increasing spread of some  invasive alien species  because of climate change. [18]    Figure 2: Terrestrial mean species abundance, globally and for selected world regions, 20102050 [3]           Data source:  OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050    Note:  Please read reference  [19]  for additional information.     Box 1: Thresholds and tipping points  There is evidence that ecosystems may need to maintain a minimum quality in order to function effectively. Below critical thresholds, ecosystems may suddenly switch in character, no longer providing the same kind, or level, of services.  [20]   Thresholds, amplifying feedbacks and time-lag effects leading to tipping points make the impacts of global change on biodiversity hard to predict and difficult to control once they begin.    An area of particular concern in this regard is the Amazon basin, where recent research suggests that complex interactions between deforestation, fire and climate change could lead to a shift to savannah-like vegetation.  [21]  Global-scale impacts of such a shift would include a reduced carbon sink, increased carbon emissions, and the massive loss of biodiversity.  [21]   Some studies even suggest that a planetary-scale tipping point, implying radical changes in the global ecosystem as a whole, might be approaching.  [20]    Forests, drylands and wetlands    Demand for land has resulted in alarming tropical  deforestation  in recent decades. While overall global tropical deforestation remains high, some countries such as Brazil and Indonesia have slowed their rates. Mainly because of  afforestation  in temperate areas, some models project net global forest loss to halt after 2020. [3]  While plantations provide  ecosystem services  such as provisioning timber and carbon sequestration, they fall short of primary forests in delivering others, particularly forest biodiversity. Primary forests are projected to decrease steadily up to 2050, with the regions of most concern being Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and South East Asia. [11][22]    Likewise, drylands and wetlands are threatened by depletion and loss of biodiversity. Drylands cover about 40 % of the Earth's surface and host about 2 billion people, but their transformation into cultivated cropland continues at alarming rates, resulting in water stress and soil degradation. Very high rates of irreversible conversion of peatland and coastal wetlands such as mangroves for agriculture, forestry and infrastructure are also likely to continue. [11]    Marine ecosystems   In recent decades global marine ecosystems and their biodiversity have become increasingly threatened. In 2011, around 29 % of marine fish stocks were estimated as fished at a biologically unsustainable level and, therefore, overfished. In the same year, about 61 % were fully exploited and only 10 % held potential for increased harvesting. [23]  In addition to threats from overexploitation and nutrient pollution ( GMT 10 ), ocean warming and acidification are projected to pose serious and increasing risks ( GMT 9 ). Modelling of alternative marine fishery strategies up to 2050 indicates that marine catches and stocks will decline in the world's main fishing regions unless catches are reduced. [24]    Implications    Loss of ecosystem services    Global and regional assessments indicate that biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation will continue or accelerate under all policy scenarios considered. [21][25]  The drivers of biodiversity loss are likely to greatly outweigh the effects of any biodiversity protection measures. [25]  Ecosystem degradation erodes nature's ability to support human societies, [26]  as ecosystems provide a wide range of services [27][28]  and indeed escalating competition for food, water and other natural resources could foster regional instability, increasing risks of conflict.   The benefits of protecting ecosystems and their associated services often far outweigh the costs. [26][29]  However, market systems seldom convey the full social and economic values of ecosystem services.   Reduced climate change mitigation potential and adaptive capacity   The carbon captured by natural ecosystems is of global importance in efforts to mitigate climate change ( GMT 9 ). As global forest destruction currently contributes about 12 % of global carbon dioxide emissions annually, [30]  the efficient protection of natural habitats could contribute substantially to continued carbon storage. In view of this, an international financial mechanism for reducing  greenhouse gas emissions  from deforestation and forest degradation, REDD+, has been adopted. [31]    Ecosystem-based approaches that rely on ecosystems to buffer human communities against the adverse impacts of climate change would allow natural ecosystems to play an important role in  climate change adaptation . [32][33][34]  Mangrove forests and coastal marshes, for example, can reduce disaster risks along exposed coastlines. And as the climate changes and temperatures increase (GMT 9) the need for ecosystem-based adaptation will increase. [35]    Unequal distribution of impacts   The continued degradation of ecosystems and their services will create challenges, in particular for lower income groups in developing countries. It is estimated, for example, that non-market ecosystem goods and services account for 89 % of the total income of the rural poor in Brazil, 75 % in Indonesia and 47 % in India. Sustainable management of ecosystems and socio-economic development are thus intertwined. [26][36][37]    For Europe, the effects of continued ecosystem degradation on poverty and inequality elsewhere in the world may lead to increased immigration to Europe. In addition, failing to take advantage of ecosystem-based solutions to tackle climate change in other parts of the world may increase costs in Europe. And crucially, transgressing critical ecological tipping points could cause unprecedented environmental, social and economic problems in Europe and elsewhere.,Drivers Population, consumption, and economic growth The past five decades have seen a rise in the global population to more than 7 billion people, and a concomitant industrialisation of agriculture (GMT 1).[1] About 2 % of the global land area is currently covered by cities and infrastructures.[2] However, continued population growth and urbanisation (GMT 2) might cause this to double by 2050.[2] In addition, continued global economic growth (GMT 5), accompanied by a rapidly growing global middle class  with resource-intensive, developed-world mobility and consumption patterns (GMT 2)  is likely to increase pressure on habitats and landscapes, particularly in regions with a high and direct dependence on natural resources for economic development, such as sub-Saharan Africa.[3] Food and bioenergy Dietary changes might override population growth as the major driver of global demand for land in the near future.[5] Meat-based food requires about five times as much land per unit of nutritional value as its plant-based equivalent,[6] and also has a higher water footprint which is, on average, 20 times higher for beef than for cereals.[7]Since the 1960s, global average meat consumption has almost doubled, from 23 kg per person to 42 kg, with the highest consumption in the US and Europe, while China and Brazil have recorded significant increases in the last 2030 years.[8] Estimates suggest that global annual demand for meat products may increase by a further 76 % relative to 2005 to 455 million tonnes in 2050.[9] A rapid expansion in land allocated to cultivating bioenergy crops (GMT 7) could have significant ecological impacts, such as deforestation, nitrogen pollution (GMT 10) and freshwater scarcity  the water footprint associated with bioenergy crops might increase ten-fold in the period 20052030.[10] Mitigating associated pressures on ecosystems will depend on the development of bioenergy produced from agricultural and forestry residues that do not require additional land.[11] Increases in crop yields due to efficiency gains are unlikely to compensate for the growing demand for both plant- and animal-based food, and bioenergy. This could lead to a large-scale expansion of cropland, mostly at the expense of forest and grassland ecosystems, of 120500 Mha (million hectares) by 2050 on top of the current 1500 Mha of global cropland  10 % of the global land area. Furthermore, if loss of productive land to severe soil degradation and conversion to built-up areas is taken into account, cropland expansion could reach 850 Mha by 2050.[2] Competition for land and water Growing global competition for productive land and freshwater resources is apparent in the recent rapid increase in large-scale transnational land acquisitions, mostly in developing countries (Figure 1). Between 2005 and 2009, global land acquisitions by foreign investors totalled some 47 Mha,[12] slightly more than the area of Sweden. As a consequence, large-scale commercial farming is expanding at the expense of smallholder farmers and their access to land and water - in particular in Africa and parts of Asia. Population growth, demand for food and climate change are expected to create significant threats to freshwater availability.[13]Scenarios on global food demand for 2050 point to severe water stress in many regions, even if strong efficiency gains in its use are made.[14] This implies a threat to both human water security and to the functioning of ecosystems. Already today, around half of the world's major river basins, home to 2.7billion people, face water scarcity in at least one month a year,[15] and water restrictions are projected to be further amplified by climate change (GMT 9). Figure 1: Transnational land acquisitions, 2005-2009[12]  Data sources: Rulli et al., 2013 - [a]and [b]Note:Please read reference [16] for additional information. Trends Terrestrial biodiversity Some scenarios, including from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), consistently project a continued decrease of global biodiversity[3](Figure 2). Towards the mid-21st century, habitat loss due to bioenergy-crop farming and climate change is expected to gain in significance as drivers of decrease.[3][17] In a business-as-usual scenario for 2050, global terrestrial biodiversity measured as mean species abundance(MSA) is projected to decline further: from 68 % of the level that potential natural vegetation could support in 2010 to around 60 % in 2050. Strong losses may occur in, for example, in Japan/Korea, Europe, southern Africa, and Indonesia (Figure 2). These estimates may be conservative, as they exclude risks associated with transgressing possible ecosystem thresholds (Box 1) and the increasing spread of some invasive alien species because of climate change.[18] Figure 2: Terrestrial mean species abundance, globally and for selected world regions, 20102050[3]  Data source: OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050Note: Please read reference [19] for additional information. Box 1: Thresholds and tipping pointsThere is evidence that ecosystems may need to maintain a minimum quality in order to function effectively. Below critical thresholds, ecosystems may suddenly switch in character, no longer providing the same kind, or level, of services.[20] Thresholds, amplifying feedbacks and time-lag effects leading to tipping points make the impacts of global change on biodiversity hard to predict and difficult to control once they begin.An area of particular concern in this regard is the Amazon basin, where recent research suggests that complex interactions between deforestation, fire and climate change could lead to a shift to savannah-like vegetation.[21]Global-scale impacts of such a shift would include a reduced carbon sink, increased carbon emissions, and the massive loss of biodiversity.[21] Some studies even suggest that a planetary-scale tipping point, implying radical changes in the global ecosystem as a whole, might be approaching.[20] Forests, drylands and wetlands  Demand for land has resulted in alarming tropical deforestation in recent decades. While overall global tropical deforestation remains high, some countries such as Brazil and Indonesia have slowed their rates. Mainly because of afforestation in temperate areas, some models project net global forest loss to halt after 2020.[3] While plantations provide ecosystem services such as provisioning timber and carbon sequestration, they fall short of primary forests in delivering others, particularly forest biodiversity. Primary forests are projected to decrease steadily up to 2050, with the regions of most concern being Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and South East Asia.[11][22] Likewise, drylands and wetlands are threatened by depletion and loss of biodiversity. Drylands cover about 40 % of the Earth's surface and host about 2 billion people, but their transformation into cultivated cropland continues at alarming rates, resulting in water stress and soil degradation. Very high rates of irreversible conversion of peatland and coastal wetlands such as mangroves for agriculture, forestry and infrastructure are also likely to continue.[11] Marine ecosystems In recent decades global marine ecosystems and their biodiversity have become increasingly threatened. In 2011, around 29 % of marine fish stocks were estimated as fished at a biologically unsustainable level and, therefore, overfished. In the same year, about 61 % were fully exploited and only 10 % held potential for increased harvesting.[23] In addition to threats from overexploitation and nutrient pollution (GMT 10), ocean warming and acidification are projected to pose serious and increasing risks (GMT 9). Modelling of alternative marine fishery strategies up to 2050 indicates that marine catches and stocks will decline in the world's main fishing regions unless catches are reduced.[24] Implications Loss of ecosystem services Global and regional assessments indicate that biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation will continue or accelerate under all policy scenarios considered.[21][25] The drivers of biodiversity loss are likely to greatly outweigh the effects of any biodiversity protection measures.[25] Ecosystem degradation erodes nature's ability to support human societies,[26] as ecosystems provide a wide range of services[27][28] and indeed escalating competition for food, water and other natural resources could foster regional instability, increasing risks of conflict. The benefits of protecting ecosystems and their associated services often far outweigh the costs.[26][29] However, market systems seldom convey the full social and economic values of ecosystem services. Reduced climate change mitigation potential and adaptive capacity The carbon captured by natural ecosystems is of global importance in efforts to mitigate climate change (GMT 9). As global forest destruction currently contributes about 12 % of global carbon dioxide emissions annually,[30] the efficient protection of natural habitats could contribute substantially to continued carbon storage. In view of this, an international financial mechanism for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, REDD+, has been adopted.[31] Ecosystem-based approaches that rely on ecosystems to buffer human communities against the adverse impacts of climate change would allow natural ecosystems to play an important role in climate change adaptation.[32][33][34] Mangrove forests and coastal marshes, for example, can reduce disaster risks along exposed coastlines. And as the climate changes and temperatures increase (GMT 9) the need for ecosystem-based adaptation will increase.[35] Unequal distribution of impacts The continued degradation of ecosystems and their services will create challenges, in particular for lower income groups in developing countries. It is estimated, for example, that non-market ecosystem goods and services account for 89 % of the total income of the rural poor in Brazil, 75 % in Indonesia and 47 % in India. Sustainable management of ecosystems and socio-economic development are thus intertwined.[26][36][37] For Europe, the effects of continued ecosystem degradation on poverty and inequality elsewhere in the world may lead to increased immigration to Europe. In addition, failing to take advantage of ecosystem-based solutions to tackle climate change in other parts of the world may increase costs in Europe. And crucially, transgressing critical ecological tipping points could cause unprecedented environmental, social and economic problems in Europe and elsewhere."
"green-economy  Green economy  green growth sustainability sustainable development eco-innovation systemic perspectives resource efficiency         Context      The concept of the green economy has emerged in recent years as a strategic priority for governments and intergovernmental organisations. [e.g.  1 ][ 2 ]  In Europe, it features prominently in a range of medium- and long-term EU programmes and strategies, including the Europe 2020 Strategy, [ 3 ]  the 7th Environment Action Programme, [ 4 ]  the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Horizon 2020) [ 5 ]  and sectoral policies in areas such as transport and energy.     Figure 1:Correlation of ecological footprint (2008) and the human development index (2012)         Source:  National footprint accounts 2008 and Human Development Index (HDI)  Note: Please read reference [6] for additional information.     The growing prominence of the green economy in EU policy reflects a recognition that the prevailing economic paradigm is inconsistent with Europes long-term development goals, encapsulated in the 2050 vision of living well within the planets limits. [ 4 ]  Across the world, the transition to high levels of human development has been achieved by adopting production and consumption patterns that put a disproportionate burden on the environment (Figure 1). As a result, some countries today live well, while others live within the limits of the planet. None do both.   A green economy is essentially one in which socio-economic systems are organised in ways that enable society to live well within planetary boundaries. The concept therefore has several dimensions. The first is a focus on increasingresource efficiency: identifying the innovations and approaches that enable society to extract maximum value from resources and minimise harmful emissions and waste.   Although essential, resource efficiency alone will not guarantee that natural capital stocks are maintained for future generations or that economic activity delivers acceptable living standards and social cohesion. Efforts to enhance resource efficiency must therefore be complemented with a focus onecosystem resilienceand onpeople's well-being. After all, an economic model that transcends ecosystem boundaries will not be sustainable in the long term; one that cannot provide decent jobs and earnings will not be politically or socially viable.   Trends    Resource efficiency   Europes resource efficiency has increased in recent years, alleviating some of the environmental pressures associated with economic production. For example, EU-28 greenhouse gas emissions have decreased by 19 % since 1990 despite a 45 % increase in gross domestic product. Fossil fuel use has also declined, as have emissions of some pollutants from  transport  and  industry . More recently, the EUs total resource use has declined by 19 % since 2007, less waste is being generated and recycling rates have improved in nearly every country.   These trends potentially mark important progress in Europes efforts to reconfigure its production-consumption systems but significant problems persist. European resource use and harmful emissions remain high in absolute terms. Some of the apparent efficiency improvements may partially reflect the relocation of material extraction and manufacturing to other parts of the world. And the level of ambition of existing environmental policy may be inadequate to achieve Europes long-term environment and climate objectives. For example, projected greenhouse gas emissions reductions are currently insufficient to bring the EU onto a pathway towards its target of reducing emissions by 8095% by 2050.   Environmental resilience and people's well-being   In addition, Europes recent progress in reducing environmental pressures has not always been matched by improved ecosystem resilience or reduced risks to people's health and well-being. For example, although water pollution is declining, most  freshwater  bodies across Europe are not expected to achieve good ecological status by 2015. Similarly, Europe is not on track to meet its overall target of halting  biodiversity loss  by 2020, even though some more specific targets are being met. Loss of  soil functions ,  land degradation  and  climate change  remain major threats to ecosystem resilience, undermining flows of environmental goods and services and therefore jeopardising the social resilience of communities reliant on them.   Turning to people's  health  and  well-being , there have been marked improvements in the quality of drinking water and bathing water and some reductions in hazardous pollutants. However,  air  and  noise  pollution continue to cause serious health impacts. In 2011, about 430000 premature deaths in the EU were attributed to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), [ 7 ]  while exposure to environmental noise is estimated to contribute to at least 10000 premature deaths due to coronary heart disease and strokes each year. [ 8 ]  Environmental impacts on human health and well-being are particularly pronounced in  urban settings  where multiple pressures coexist. Conversely, well planned urban areas providing easy access to natural, green environments can deliver substantial health and well-being benefits, including protection from the impacts of climate change. [ 9 ]    Environmental policies are also creating socio-economic opportunities and thereby contributing to the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. For example, employment in the environment industry sector, which produces goods and services that reduce environmental degradation and maintain natural resources, increased by 44 % between 2000 and 2011, while sectoral value added increased by 57 %. It has been one of the few economic sectors to have flourished in terms of revenues, trade and jobs since the 2008 financial crisis.   Response    The trends set out above indicate that although policy has delivered some important advances, Europe remains a long way from achieving the transition to a green economy.   In part this reflects the fact that the complex links between environmental and socio-economic systems can undermine efforts to reduce environmental pressures and related impacts. For example, technology-driven efficiency gains may be undermined by lifestyle changes or increased  consumption , partly because efficiency improvements can make outputs cheaper (the rebound effect). Policies and local management efforts can be counteracted by external pressures related to  global megatrends . Changing exposure patterns and human vulnerabilities, for example linked to urbanisation, can offset reductions in pressures. And the unsustainable systems of production and consumption that are responsible for many environmental pressures also provide diverse benefits, such as jobs and earnings, which can create strong incentives for sectors or communities to resist change.   The systemic, transboundary and long-term characteristics of the environmental challenges facing Europe indicate that neither environmental policies alone, nor economic and technology-driven efficiency gains will be sufficient to effect the  transition to a green economy . Rather, transition will require more fundamental changes in the global production-consumption systems that meet basic demands, such as for food, mobility, energy and shelter.    The 7th Environment Action Programme sets out four key pillars of an enabling framework for the transition to a green economy: implementation, integration, information and investments. In a green economy approach, the focus is on identifying synergies that enable economic, environmental and social objectives to be advanced concurrently.   For example, implementation of environmental regulations plays an important role in protecting ecosystems but can also contribute to enhancedresource-efficiency by incentivising companies to invest in eco-innovation. This in turn gives businesses a first-mover advantage toexport their innovationsabroad, thus generating earnings and jobs. Major EU engineering companies already earn up to 40 % of revenues from their environment portfolios, and this is set to increase. [ 10 ]  Similarly, taxing environmentally damaging activities can raise revenues, allowing governments to reduce taxes onlabour or reduce budget deficits. Combined with eliminating environmentally harmful subsidies, such fiscal reforms are essential in the transition to a green economy.   The green economy perspective provides a framework for integrating the environment into the policies of key economic sectors. For example, European policy on material resource use can be represented as a nested set of objectives (Figure 2). Whereas a  circular economy  focuses on optimising material resource flows by minimising waste, the green economy approach extends the focus to how water,  energy , land and biodiversity should be managed to secure ecosystem resilience and human well-being. The green economy also addresses wider issues, such as competitiveness and unequal exposure to environmental pressures and access to green spaces.   In addition, efforts to promote a renaissance of industry in Europe [e.g. 11 ] could form part of an integrated approach to managing production and  consumption  so as to ensure that efficiency improvements are secured across the supply chain.   Figure 2: The green economy as an integrating framework for policies on material use         Expanding the environmental knowledge base can support better implementation and integration of environment and climate policy, inform investment choices, and support long-term transitions. An expanded knowledge base also enables policymakers and businesses to take decisions that fully reflect environmental limits, risks, uncertainties, benefits and costs.   At present there is a gap between available, established monitoring, data and indicators and the knowledge required to support transitions. Addressing this gap requires investment in better understanding of systems science, forward-looking information, systemic risks, and the relationship between environmental change and human well-being. Accounting systems  both physical and monetary  are also important to inform policy and investment decisions, because getting the balance right between use, protection and enhancement of natural capital requires information on the current status of stocks and flows. [ 12 ][ 13 ]    Investment has an essential role in the transition to a green economy, in part because the systems that meet basic social needs such as water, energy and mobility rely on costly and long-lasting infrastructure.Investment choices can therefore have long-term implications for the functioning of these systems and their impacts, as well as for the viability of alternative technologies. Transitions depend in part on avoiding investments that lock in existing technologies, limit options, or hinder the development of substitutes.   Enormous amounts of capital are needed to finance infrastructure such as smart electrical grids, renewable energies, electrification of transport, and resource-efficient buildings. In addition to  fiscal reforms , innovative financing mechanisms, such as the project bond initiative of the European Commission and the European Investment Bank, socially responsible investments (SRI), green bonds and sovereign wealth funds (SWF), are potential tools for supplying the needed funds. [ 14 ]    Designing actionable, credible and feasible green economy pathways can put Europe at the frontier of science and technology. But effecting the needed transitions will demand ingenuity, creativity, courage and a greater sense of urgency.,Context The concept of the green economy has emerged in recent years as a strategic priority for governments and intergovernmental organisations.[e.g. 1][2] In Europe, it features prominently in a range of medium- and long-term EU programmes and strategies, including the Europe 2020 Strategy,[3] the 7th Environment Action Programme,[4] the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Horizon 2020)[5] and sectoral policies in areas such as transport and energy.

"economic  Continued economic growth? (GMT 5)  global megatrends economic growth economy     Drivers   Globally, countries are continually seeking ways to stimulate economic growth as a means of providing jobs and improving living standards. At the most basic level, economic output depends on population size and output per person; each has accounted for about half the global economic growth since 1700. [1]    While population growth is linked to fertility, mortality and migration rates (GMT 1), productivity has more complex determinants. Today it is understood to depend on the development of four key forms of capital: human (knowledge, skills and health); social (trust, norms and institutions); manufactured (machinery and infrastructure); and natural (resources and ecosystems). [2]    Often these capitals are complements, with the value of one dependent on the presence of another. For example, if natural resource wealth is not accompanied by effective state institutions, it can fuel corruption and weaken competitiveness, thereby undermining economic growth. [3]  Equally, investments that augment manufactured capital are likely to be counter-productive if they degrade essential environmental systems. As Daly has observed, 'what good is a sawmill without a forest?' [4]    Technological and social innovation plays a key role in the development of capital stocks, driving long-term growth. Examples include the development of tools and machinery, and aggregation of labour and businesses in urban settings, and the division of production processes into multiple stages handled by different workers. Such innovation increases productivity  enabling society to maximise the economic returns on finite inputs of labour and resources. Innovation is also at the core of structural economic change  the transition from largely agrarian economies through industrialisation to largely service-based structures.   As a result of innovation and investment, several of the capital stocks underpinning economic output have been increased markedly in recent decades. In developed countries, manufactured capital was worth 2.03.5 years of national income in 1970 but increased to 4.07.0 years of national income by 2010. [5]  Workforces also expanded. The global population of those aged between 15 and 64 tripled to 4.54 billion in the period 19502010. [6]  Education, skills and human health are also improving, particularly in developing regions (GMTs  1 ,  3 ). At the same time, however, natural capital is increasingly under pressure (GMTs  8 ,  9 ,  10 ).      Trends   The spread of global growth   Rapid economic growth is a comparatively recent phenomenon. Productivity increases were negligible before 1700, implying that economic output rose no faster than the very modest rate of population growth about 0.1 % annually. In the 18th century, however, the agricultural and industrial revolutions in Western Europe caused a fundamental shift, initiating a steady acceleration of economic growth. By the first half of the 20th century, average annual global GDP growth had reached 2 % and this rose to 4 % in the period 19502008. As a result, world economic output increased 25-fold in the period 19002008. [1]    Global growth in recent decades was made possible by the exceptionally rapid economic expansion in some very large developing countries, which were able to import knowledge, practices and technologies rather than going through the slower process of developing them domestically. China is the most important example  its economy grew by an average of 9.8 % per year in the period 19802013, doubling in size every seven years. [7]    The financial crisis of 2008 and subsequent economic turmoil had a major impact on economic growth globally. Developed regions were hit hardest. In 2013, for example, the EU's economic output was still 1 % below its 2007 level. [7]  Major developing countries including Brazil, Russia and South Africa also endured recessions, while others   notably China, India and Indonesia  faced an appreciable slow-down in growth.   Many emerging economies have since proven to be remarkably resilient, however, sustaining global growth despite stagnation is most advanced economies. In 20072013, India's GDP increased by 46% and China's by 68 %. [7]  As a result, the financial crisis greatly advanced the rebalancing of economic production across the world ( GMT 6 ).   Decelerating growth    Following the 2008 financial crisis, many uncertainties surround the short-term outlook for global growth. These include, for example, concerns about the quality of the domestic investment that have helped sustain China's growth since 2008, and worries about the prospects for continued economic integration in Europe, especially among the countries using the euro.   Although annual growth rates may remain volatile, however, the broad direction of global growth appears clearer in the medium and long term. World economic growth is projected to remain robust in coming decades as investment in human, social and manufactured capital enable other countries to follow in China's footsteps. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) projects that global GDP will almost triple in the years 20102050 (Figure 1).   In 2013, GDP per capita (PPP) in China stood at 22 % of the US level, while India's stood at 10 %. As those countries' huge populations continue to shift towards the systems of production and consumption present in today's advanced economies, the expansion in GDP is likely to dwarf even that achieved by the US during the past century. By 2050, India's economic output is projected to be just 14 % smaller than US economic output while China's is projected to be 40 % larger.   Global economic growth is expected to decelerate steadily in the coming decades, however, from a postcrisis peak of 4.3 % in 2017 to just under 2 % a year in 2050. Economic expansion in China is projected to slow particularly sharply, from an average of 7.9 % a year in 20102020 to 1.9 % in 20402050. Meanwhile, India is expected to become the fastest growing economy among Brazil, Russian, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa (BRIICS), with an average annual increase of 5.9 % in 20102050, although there too it is projected to slow to below 4 % by the end of the period. In the EU, demographic trends are projected to contribute to a fall in GDP growth, from 1.7 % a year in 2020 to 1.3 % in 2050.  [8]     Figure 1: Past and projected global economic output, 19962050             Data source: OECD  [8]    Long-term Baseline Projections 2014  Note: EU-OECD refers to the EU Member States that are also members of the OECD. These countries accounted for approximately 97 % of EU-28 GDP in 2012.    Implications   Poverty alleviation in developing regions   The combination of rapid economic growth in developing regions and much slower growth in advanced economies creates a mixture of opportunities and concerns.   While the link between GDP and human well-being is undoubtedly complex, it is clear that economic expansion delivers a range of important benefits for society. Growth plays an important role in determining household earnings and sustaining employment levels. Equally, economic performance shapes the revenues available to governments and, correspondingly, the resources available for public infrastructure and services such as education, healthcare and various forms of social security.   There is much evidence that economic growth in recent decades has delivered substantial improvements in living standards. The poverty gap  the proportion of the population living on less than USD 1.25 a day  fell globally, although the pace varied between regions. The fastest reduction was in the developing countries of east Asia and the Pacific, where the proportion fell from 35 % in 1981 to just 2.8 % in 2010. This performance contrasted sharply with the developing countries of subSaharan Africa, where the proportion increased from 22 % in 1981 to 26 % in 1996, before falling back to 21 % in 2010. [7]  Nevertheless, the percentage of the global community living on less than USD 1.25 a day fell from 47 % in 1990 to 22 % in 2010  a reduction of about 700 million people. [9]    Managing inequality and environmental degradation   Economic growth in both developing and developed regions is also associated with social and economic harm that threatens to undermine improvements in living standards. One key concern relates to the distribution of wealth and incomes. Although the rapid growth of developing regions is reducing inequality of living standards at the global scale, the trends within countries often show the opposite. For example, the shift away from planned economies in countries such as Russia and China has brought greater inequality, as has the explosion of executive salaries in the US and other advanced economies. [10][11]       Increased inequality has long been recognised as a potential side-effect of industrialisation, with wage disparities widening as a portion of the population moves from agricultural activities to more productive urban work. [12]  Later stages in structural economic change tend to see a convergence of rural and urban wages. Recent analysis suggests, however, that the sluggish growth in many advanced economies could augment inequality by leading to the accumulation and concentration of wealth. [13]  Technological advances may further augment inequality (GMT 4). Mitigating the inequities that can arise from economic growth trends is, therefore, a governance challenge at all stages of economic development.   Another concern relates to the links between the economic growth and environmental degradation. Although in many areas resource efficiency is increasing, the scale of economic activity globally is pushing resource use and emissions to higher absolute levels (GMTs  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 ), with potentially huge impacts on natural cycles. The interdependence of global environmental systems means that individual countries and regions, including Europe, are increasingly affected by action elsewhere.   While slower growth in the EU and elsewhere may alleviate environmental pressures, it also brings social and environmental risks. [14]  In some EU countries, an expected rise in dependents relative to the working population is likely to undermine labour tax revenues while boosting the demand for pensions and public health expenditure. [15]  And while the accumulating wealth that may accompany slow growth could provide an alternative tax base, governments face some difficulties in raising revenues from this source as liberalised financial markets enable investment and profits to shift to countries offering lower taxes. [13]  Taken together, these fiscal pressures could weaken investment in environmental protection and motivate governments to relax environmental standards in order to boost economic growth.   Moving beyond GDP   Worries about the social and environmental harm that can arise when governments focus too narrowly on economic growth have directed attention to the need for better measures of human well-being and economic robustness. Quality of life, it is argued, is shaped by numerous factors that are at most partially related to economic output. These include health, time with friends and family, access to resources and a pleasant living environment, education, social equity, leisure, political participation, and personal and economic security.   Equally important, GDP provides little indication of the status of the capital stocks that underpin output; indeed, focusing just on GDP growth actually creates incentives to deplete capital stocks because the returns are treated as income.   A number of processes have been initiated in recent years to develop better indicators of progress by integrating environmental and social components. These include the EU's Beyond GDP initiative, [16][17]  the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress initiated by the French government in 2008, [18]  the United Nations Human Development Index, [19]  and the OECD Better Life Index. [20]  Stiglitz et al. capture the current mood with the observation that 'the time is ripe for our measurement system to shift emphasis from measuring economic production to measuring people's wellbeing'. [21],Drivers Globally, countries are continually seeking ways to stimulate economic growth as a means of providing jobs and improving living standards. At the most basic level, economic output depends on population size and output per person; each has accounted for about half the global economic growth since 1700.[1] While population growth is linked to fertility, mortality and migration rates (GMT 1), productivity has more complex determinants. Today it is understood to depend on the development of four key forms of capital: human (knowledge, skills and health); social (trust, norms and institutions); manufactured (machinery and infrastructure); and natural (resources and ecosystems).[2] Often these capitals are complements, with the value of one dependent on the presence of another. For example, if natural resource wealth is not accompanied by effective state institutions, it can fuel corruption and weaken competitiveness, thereby undermining economic growth.[3] Equally, investments that augment manufactured capital are likely to be counter-productive if they degrade essential environmental systems. As Daly has observed, 'what good is a sawmill without a forest?'[4] Technological and social innovation plays a key role in the development of capital stocks, driving long-term growth. Examples include the development of tools and machinery, and aggregation of labour and businesses in urban settings, and the division of production processes into multiple stages handled by different workers. Such innovation increases productivity  enabling society to maximise the economic returns on finite inputs of labour and resources. Innovation is also at the core of structural economic change  the transition from largely agrarian economies through industrialisation to largely service-based structures. As a result of innovation and investment, several of the capital stocks underpinning economic output have been increased markedly in recent decades. In developed countries, manufactured capital was worth 2.03.5 years of national income in 1970 but increased to 4.07.0 years of national income by 2010.[5] Workforces also expanded. The global population of those aged between 15 and 64 tripled to 4.54 billion in the period 19502010.[6] Education, skills and human health are also improving, particularly in developing regions (GMTs 1, 3). At the same time, however, natural capital is increasingly under pressure (GMTs 8, 9, 10).  Trends The spread of global growth Rapid economic growth is a comparatively recent phenomenon. Productivity increases were negligible before 1700, implying that economic output rose no faster than the very modest rate of population growth about 0.1 % annually. In the 18th century, however, the agricultural and industrial revolutions in Western Europe caused a fundamental shift, initiating a steady acceleration of economic growth. By the first half of the 20th century, average annual global GDP growth had reached 2 % and this rose to 4 % in the period 19502008. As a result, world economic output increased 25-fold in the period 19002008.[1] Global growth in recent decades was made possible by the exceptionally rapid economic expansion in some very large developing countries, which were able to import knowledge, practices and technologies rather than going through the slower process of developing them domestically. China is the most important example  its economy grew by an average of 9.8 % per year in the period 19802013, doubling in size every seven years.[7] The financial crisis of 2008 and subsequent economic turmoil had a major impact on economic growth globally. Developed regions were hit hardest. In 2013, for example, the EU's economic output was still 1 % below its 2007 level.[7] Major developing countries including Brazil, Russia and South Africa also endured recessions, while others notably China, India and Indonesia  faced an appreciable slow-down in growth. Many emerging economies have since proven to be remarkably resilient, however, sustaining global growth despite stagnation is most advanced economies. In 20072013, India's GDP increased by 46% and China's by 68 %.[7] As a result, the financial crisis greatly advanced the rebalancing of economic production across the world (GMT 6). Decelerating growth  Following the 2008 financial crisis, many uncertainties surround the short-term outlook for global growth. These include, for example, concerns about the quality of the domestic investment that have helped sustain China's growth since 2008, and worries about the prospects for continued economic integration in Europe, especially among the countries using the euro. Although annual growth rates may remain volatile, however, the broad direction of global growth appears clearer in the medium and long term. World economic growth is projected to remain robust in coming decades as investment in human, social and manufactured capital enable other countries to follow in China's footsteps. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) projects that global GDP will almost triple in the years 20102050 (Figure 1). In 2013, GDP per capita (PPP) in China stood at 22 % of the US level, while India's stood at 10 %. As those countries' huge populations continue to shift towards the systems of production and consumption present in today's advanced economies, the expansion in GDP is likely to dwarf even that achieved by the US during the past century. By 2050, India's economic output is projected to be just 14 % smaller than US economic output while China's is projected to be 40 % larger. Global economic growth is expected to decelerate steadily in the coming decades, however, from a postcrisis peak of 4.3 % in 2017 to just under 2 % a year in 2050. Economic expansion in China is projected to slow particularly sharply, from an average of 7.9 % a year in 20102020 to 1.9 % in 20402050. Meanwhile, India is expected to become the fastest growing economy among Brazil, Russian, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa (BRIICS), with an average annual increase of 5.9 % in 20102050, although there too it is projected to slow to below 4 % by the end of the period. In the EU, demographic trends are projected to contribute to a fall in GDP growth, from 1.7 % a year in 2020 to 1.3 % in 2050.[8] Figure 1: Past and projected global economic output, 19962050  Data source: OECD[8] Long-term Baseline Projections 2014Note: EU-OECD refers to the EU Member States that are also members of the OECD. These countries accounted for approximately 97 % of EU-28 GDP in 2012. Implications Poverty alleviation in developing regions The combination of rapid economic growth in developing regions and much slower growth in advanced economies creates a mixture of opportunities and concerns. While the link between GDP and human well-being is undoubtedly complex, it is clear that economic expansion delivers a range of important benefits for society. Growth plays an important role in determining household earnings and sustaining employment levels. Equally, economic performance shapes the revenues available to governments and, correspondingly, the resources available for public infrastructure and services such as education, healthcare and various forms of social security. There is much evidence that economic growth in recent decades has delivered substantial improvements in living standards. The poverty gap  the proportion of the population living on less than USD 1.25 a day  fell globally, although the pace varied between regions. The fastest reduction was in the developing countries of east Asia and the Pacific, where the proportion fell from 35 % in 1981 to just 2.8 % in 2010. This performance contrasted sharply with the developing countries of subSaharan Africa, where the proportion increased from 22 % in 1981 to 26 % in 1996, before falling back to 21 % in 2010.[7] Nevertheless, the percentage of the global community living on less than USD 1.25 a day fell from 47 % in 1990 to 22 % in 2010  a reduction of about 700 million people.[9] Managing inequality and environmental degradation Economic growth in both developing and developed regions is also associated with social and economic harm that threatens to undermine improvements in living standards.

"climate  Increasingly severe consequences of climate change (GMT 9)  climate change impacts climate change consequences global megatrends     Drivers   The evidence is clear.  Climate change  is real, and it is largely caused by human activities, primarily  greenhouse gas emissions  from fossil fuel burning, but also from other activities such as  agriculture  and  deforestation . Through these activities, atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane or ozone have increased, causing the Earth to warm. Carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by about 40% since 1750, with most of the increase since the 1970s when global energy consumption started to increase strongly. [1]  Evidence from ice cores suggest that current carbon dioxide concentrations are higher than at any other time over the last 800 000 years. [2]    Recent progress in climate science allows for a clear attribution of the human contribution to changes in many components of the  climate system . [1]  It is extremely likely [ 3]  that most of the observed rise in global surface temperature since the mid-20th century was caused by increases in greenhouse gas emissions and other  anthropogenic  activities. It is also very likely that human influence has substantially contributed to increases in upper ocean temperatures, Arctic sea-ice loss, global mean sea-level rise and changes in the frequency and intensity of temperature extremes, such as heat waves, since the mid-20th century. [1]  There have been no significant long-term changes in the suns energy output that could have contributed to the observed climatic changes. [1]    Figure 1: Projected changes in average temperature, 20812100 relative to 19862005 for low-emission (left: RCP 2.6) and high-emission (right: RCP 8.5) scenarios. [1]           Data source:  IPCC (2013)      Trends   Observed changes    The Earths combined land and ocean surface temperature has warmed by 0.85 (0.651.06) C between 1880 and 2012, and the number of hot days and nights [4] has increased over most land areas. Multiannual and decadal variability caused by natural factors does not contradict this long-term global warming trend. Observed warming is accompanied by significant reductions in ice and snow cover across the world  the minimum summer extent of Arctic sea ice has decreased by about 40 % since 1979. [1]    Observed changes in  precipitation  show strong regional variations. In many regions, including Europe and North America, increases in either the frequency or intensity of heavy precipitation events have been observed. In contrast, climate records show an increased frequency and intensity of drought events in the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. [1]    Global sea levels have risen by about 20 cm since 1901 due to thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets. The rate of increase has risen from 1.7 mm for 19012010 to 3.2 mm for 19932010. [1]    Projected future changes [5]    By the late 21st century (20812100), global mean surface temperature is expected to increase by another 2.64.8 C compared to the reference period (19862005) if greenhouse gas emissions continue on a high trajectory (RCP 8.5; Figure 1, right). Strong emissions abatement could limit this to 0.31.7 C (RCP 2.6; Figure 1, left). [1]  To have a two-thirds chance of keeping the global mean surface temperature rise to below 2 C compared to the pre-industrial period, the target of the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC), cumulative carbon emissions since 1870 need to be kept below 1 000 gigatonnes, of which 515 gigatonnes were already emitted between 1870 and 2011. [1]    Figure 2: Projected change of global mean sea level (21 st  century) [1]            Data source:  IPPC (2013)  Note : The figure shows modelled global mean sea level rise over the 21st century relative to 1986-2005, derived from a combination of the   CMIP5   ensemble with process-based models, for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5.      As temperature increases, it is very likely that the number and intensity of hot extremes and heat waves will increase globally. Projected changes in precipitation vary significantly between regions. Mean precipitation is likely to decrease further in such regions as the Mediterranean and North Africa, in particular under a high-emission scenario. In contrast, more intense and frequent extreme precipitation events are very likely in most mid-latitude regions, in, for example, Europe and North America, and wet tropical regions.    Global ocean temperature in the upper 100 m is projected to increase by 0.62.0C by 2100, depending on the emissions scenario. Arctic sea-ice cover will continue to shrink, and, under a high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), the Arctic Ocean in September is likely to be almost ice-free before mid-century.   Global mean sea-level rise is projected to accelerate further, with an additional rise by 20812100 of 0.260.55m (RCP 2.6) or 0.520.98 m (RCP 8.5; Figure 2; 1). The rise will not stop in 2100, and even modest sustained warming of 2 C above pre-industrial levels is estimated to lead to sea-level rise of at least 4 m over of the following 2 000 years.  [6][7]      Implications  [8]      Drawing on a larger scientific knowledge base than ever before, the IPCC has concluded that continued global warming will increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible consequences in most world regions. [9]  However, risk reduction is possible through climate-change mitigation and adaptation (for details of the European context see  SOER2015 ). Mitigation is the only option for reducing the risk of large-scale climate change. Action taken now and in the next few decades will determine the severity of consequences in the second half of the 21st century and beyond, while the co-benefits of mitigation action, such as reductions in  air pollution , could be felt immediately.   Climate change mitigation and adaptation are also linked to other aspects of sustainable development, in particular the protection of biodiversity and food and energy security ( GMT 8 ). A recent study, for example, suggests that with rising populations ( GMT 1 ) and projected consumption levels ( GMT 2 ,  5  and  6 ), there will not be enough land to simultaneously conserve all remaining natural ecosystems, halt forest loss and switch to 100% renewable energy. [10]    Natural ecosystems and their services   The IPCC estimates that an increase in global temperature of up to 2C compared to preindustrial levels carries moderate risks in terms of global aggregate impacts on ecosystems. Unique and threatened systems including the Arctic sea-ice ecosystem, coral reefs and the Amazon forest, however, are at very high risk of severe consequences even at this level of warming. Under scenarios of stronger warming, a large share of terrestrial and freshwater species is very likely to face an increased risk of extinction, with associated extensive further losses of biodiversity and  ecosystem services .   Marine ecosystems such as coral reefs are projected to face substantial risks due to the combined effects of ocean warming, ocean acidification and local stressors  pollution and  eutrophication  ( GMT 10 )  in particular for medium- and high-emission scenarios. Moreover, a global redistribution of marine species is expected, with decreases in the catch potential of fisheries at tropical latitudes and associated implications for livelihoods.   Human well-being and economic activities   Throughout the 21st century, climate change is projected to slow the rate of  economic growth , increase inequality, erode food security and increase the displacement of people, particularly in low-income developing countries ( GMT 1 ). Risks are unevenly distributed and are greater for disadvantaged people regardless of their country's level of development. With continued sea-level rise, low-lying areas, developing countries, in particular, are very likely to increasingly experience severe impacts through coastal flooding and coastal erosion. Indeed, flood losses in 136 major coastal cities around the globe could total USD 1 trillion or more annually by 2050 unless protection is upgraded. [11]    Estimated impacts of climate changes on crop yields since 1960 show some regionally limited gains but mostly losses. Projections suggest increasingly negative impacts on global agricultural production throughout this century (see Figure 3). Global temperature increases of 4 C or more towards the end of the 21st century, combined with increased food demand, would pose significant risks for global food security. Agricultural productivity is particularly threatened in semi-arid regions where most currently irrigated areas are projected to face increased water needs. Increases in carbon dioxide concentrations also impact plant growth directly  while elevated carbon dioxide levels can increase plant photosynthesis, they decrease food quality by inhibiting nitrogen uptake. [12]    Impacts from climate change-related extreme events are projected to increase further with warming. Increased urban flood damage from extreme precipitation is a key climate-related risk in most world regions, including in Europe. Increased drought stress and associated water restrictions and wildfires are expected in southern Europe, Australia, and parts of Africa, Asia and North America. In many of these regions, increased risks to drinking-water quality are projected even when conventional water treatment is applied.   Increases in human health impacts due to extreme heat events and the spread of disease are expected in many regions, including Europe. [13][14][ SOER2015 ]    Figure 3: Projected change in global aggregate crop yields due to climate change (20102109) [9]           Data source:  IPPC (2014)  Note : Changes in crop yields are relative to late 20th century levels. The projections consider both low-emission and high-emission scenarios, tropical and temperate regions, and adaptation and no-adaptation cases. Data for each time frame sums up to 100 %.,Drivers The evidence is clear. Climate change is real, and it is largely caused by human activities, primarily greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning, but also from other activities such as agriculture and deforestation.

Increases in human health impacts due to extreme heat events and the spread of disease are expected in many regions, including Europe.[13][14][SOER2015] Figure 3: Projected change in global aggregate crop yields due to climate change (20102109)[9]  Data source: IPPC (2014)Note: Changes in crop yields are relative to late 20th century levels.

"competition  Intensified global competition for resources (GMT 7)  global megatrends resource use resource efficiency energy efficiency competition for resources       Drivers   Global demand for resources has increased substantially since the start of the 20thcentury, driven by a number of closely related trends. Across the world, countries have undergone structural economic change, shifting from agrarian societies, primarily reliant on biomass to meet energy and material needs, to urban, industrialised economies ( GMT 2 ). The technological advances that accompanied   economic development   have provided many more uses for resources, and greatly improved methods for locating and extracting them. Coupled with a quadrupling of the worlds population in the 20th century (  GMT 1  ), innovation has underpinned a 25-fold increase in economic output (  GMT 5  ), bringing radical changes in   consumption patterns  .    Looking ahead, the global population may increase by more than a third by 2050, reaching 9.6 billion. [1]  World economic output is projected to triple in the period 20102050. [2]  And the middle class may increase from 27 % of the world population of 6.8 billion in 2009 to 58 % of more than 8.4 billion in 2030. [3]    At the same time, however, some of the drivers of past increases in resource use could alleviate demand in the future. For example, continued structural economic change  away from industrialised systems and towards services and the knowledge economy could offer ways to decouple further economic growth from resource use. Similarly, a continued shift from diffuse rural living to compact urban settlements could translate into less resource-intensive lifestyles ( GMT 2 ).   Trends   Intensifying global demand    Global materials use is estimated to have increased almost ten-fold since 1900, accelerating from annual growth of 1.3 % in 19001949, to 2.6 % in 19501999, and 3.6 % annually in 20002009 (Figure 1). [4]   Developing regions  account for an increasing proportion of global resource use. Whereas Europe was responsible for 19 % of total resource extraction in 1980 and the US accounted for 18 %, by 2009 both had fallen to 10 %. Asias share increased from 41 % to 57 % over the same period.    Resource use tends to rise as countries develop economically. However, there is evidence that growth slows or ceases at high income levels, as a consequence of reduced investment in infrastructure, structural economic change, efficiency improvements and the relocation of some manufacturing to countries with lower labour costs.  [5]    Figure 1: Global total material use by resource type, 19002009 [4]            Data source:  Krausmann et al., 2009 (data updated in 2011)     International Monetary Fund analysis, for example, indicates that consumption of base metals and steel rises in step with per person gross domestic product (GDP) but reaches a saturation point at USD 15 00020000 (2000 PPP), except in countries, such as South Korea, where industrial production and construction continue to play a major role in economic growth. [6]     Consumption of energy resources follows a similar pattern. Cross-country analysis shows a strong correlation of energy use to economic output (Figure 2). Yet in many developed countries energy use has been stable for some decades, albeit at very different levels. In 2012, the citizens of EU-28 countries consumed roughly the same amount of energy as they did in the late-1970s. In the US, energy use per person has changed little in almost half a century, while GDP per person has more than doubled.    Figure 2: Correlation of energy consumption and GDP per person, 2011 [7]            Data source: World Bank World development indicators -  [a] ,  [b] and [c]  Note:  The graph shows the correlation of national per capita energy consumption and per capita GDP. The size of the bubbles denotes total population per country. All values refer to the year 2011.     While these trends indicate a huge improvement in energy efficiency , it is clear that advanced economies remain very resource intensive. If developing regions adopt similar systems of production and consumption it will have huge implications for global resource demand. For example, if the current global population increased average energy use to EU levels it would imply a 75 % increase in world energy consumption, while an increase to US levels would imply a 270% rise.   Projections of future resource use indicate that developing regions will drive up global resource demand in coming decades. The Sustainable Europe Research Institute (SERI) expects world resource use to double between 2010 and 2030.  [5]  The International Energy Agency projects that global energy consumption will increase by 31 % in the period 20122035, based on energy policies in place in early-2014.  [8]     Uncertain access to critical resources   While global demand for resources is set to grow significantly in coming decades, the outlook for supplies is more uncertain. Geographic concentration of reserves in a limited number of countries is a concern since it affords suppliers considerable influence over global prices and supplies, as illustrated by the influence of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries over global oil markets. Uncertainty regarding access to commodities increases if reserves are concentrated in politically unstable regions.   Certain  non-renewable resources  deserve particular attention because of their economic relevance, including their role in green-energy technologies. In 2014, the European Commission identified twenty critical raw materials, based on the risks of supply shortage and their economic importance to Europe. [9]  Global production of these materials is quite concentrated (Figure 3).   Figure 3: Proportion of global production of EU critical raw materials within a single country, 20102012 [9]            Data source:  European Commision 2014    Note:  The figure shows the 20 raw materials identified by the European Commission as being critical because of risks of supply shortages and their impact on the economy.     Identifying alternative resource streams   Uncertainty about resource supplies can create strong incentives for countries to identify other ways to meet their resource needs, either by locating new sources of traditional resources or identifying substitutes. For example, rising fossil fuel prices, coupled with state efforts to promote alternatives, have incentivised huge investment in  renewable energy  in recent years. Global investment rose from USD 40 billion in 2004 to USD 214 billion in 2013. Renewable power capacity, excluding hydropower, increased more than six-fold in this period. [10]    As well as facilitating a move towards other energy sources, technological advances have also boosted access to fossil fuels. Estimates of reserves evolve rapidly as new deposits are discovered and innovation allows previously unusable or unreachable reservoirs to be exploited, for example via deep water drilling and the extraction of shale gas and oil. Indeed, proven global reserves of oil and gas have increased substantially since 1980  faster than consumption of either resource. As a result, the number of years that proven oil reserves would last at current rates of consumption has increased from 30 to more than 50years. [11]    Implications    Insecure access to essential resources and price volatility are threats to economic development and living standards. Global commodity prices have spiked repeatedly in recent years, reversing long-term downward trends. [12]  Such uncertainty represents a clear risk to the European economy, which is dependent on imported resources, particularly metals and fossil fuels. [13]    In addition to economic risks, attempts to secure access to resources can foster insecurity and conflict. [14]  Tensions can arise in connection with competing claims over resource stocks or, less directly, as a result of attempts to restrict trade flows. As the World Trade Organization notes, 'in a world where scarce natural resource endowments must be nurtured and managed with care, uncooperative trade outcomes will fuel international tension and have a deleterious effect on global welfare. '[15]    Escalating resource use also imposes an increasing burden on the environment, through impacts related to resource extraction, use and disposal. Such impacts will increase if higher prices and growing concerns over scarcity induce countries to exploit sources such as tar sands that were previously deemed uneconomic.   Clearly, growing scarcity and rising prices also create strong incentives for private and public investment in research and innovation aimed at exploiting abundant or non-depletable resources, such as wind and solar energy. Governments can augment these incentives through  ecological fiscal reform   increasing the tax burden on resource use and pollution.   Innovation can also alleviate resource demands by increasing  efficiency  or reducing  waste , although such improvements can also make products cheaper, incentivising increased  consumption . For these reasons, reducing resource demand often requires a mixture of technological improvements and policy measures addressing consumption.   Moreover, technological innovations can also augment pressures on the environment by increasing access to non-renewable or polluting resources. For example, new sources of fossil fuels could weaken the momentum behind global efforts to boost efficiency and  mitigate climate change . In globalised markets, governments may have difficulty correcting market prices and pursuing ambitious  greenhouse gas  mitigation due to opposition from businesses and consumers. The result would be to delay the shift to cleaner alternatives and greatly increase harmful emissions.,Drivers Global demand for resources has increased substantially since the start of the 20thcentury, driven by a number of closely related trends.

"health  Changing disease burdens and risks of pandemics (GMT 3)  global megatrends human health pandemics diseases health impacts       Drivers    Environmental degradation ,  climate change , and increased  urbanisation , mobility and migration all influence public health, [1][2] for example by raising the risk of the global transfer of  infectious disease  and exposing people to environmental hazards ( GMTs 1 , 2 , 8 , 10 ). [3][4]  Elderly and poor people are particularly vulnerable.     Environmental health risks include  particulate matter ;  ozone ;  indoor air pollution ; unsafe water and sanitation; contamination from waste, including from research activities; exposure to chemicals, lead, mercury and other heavy metals; [3][5]  and  noise . Overall, 24 % of the global burden of disease and 23 % of premature deaths are attributable to environmental causes. [6]  Urban air pollution, especially ambient particulate matter and ozone, are set to become the main environmental cause of mortality worldwide by 2050. [7][8]  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) forecasts that the number of premature deaths from exposure to particulate matter in urban areas could more than double to 3.6 billion in 2050, most in China and India. Premature deaths from indoor air pollution, however, are likely to fall in coming years.  [6]   Ozone has a marked effect on   human health  (Figure 1) and is the most damaging air pollutant to vegetation, including crops.    Although economicgrowth and improved social conditions have reduced poverty, improved nutrition and widened access to safe drinking water, basic sanitation and education, they have encouraged unhealthylifestylesin the developed world and increasingly among the developing worlds rapidly growing middle class. As a result, non-communicable disease (NCD) and medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes, mental disorders and obesity, now outweigh communicable ones.  [9]     By 2011,global average life expectancy reached 70 in 2011  [12][13]  and is expected to rise to 75 by 20452050 ( GMT 1 ).  [10]  Older people, however, are more vulnerable to environmental hazards, spend more years living with injury and illness  [11]  and are susceptible to conditions of ageing, notably dementia.   Economic inequality,  poverty and food insecurity continue to affect health outcomes and shorten lives within and across countries . Today 1.2 billion people still live in extreme poverty while in 20112013, 842 million peoples did not get enough food to live active lives.  [14][15]        Rapid technological development creates both benefits and risks. Health services have and will benefit from bio-, nano- and information technologies (  GMT 4  ), but their novelty means that the effects of their application on human and  ecosystem  health are little understood. Their wastes and emissions are of particular concern  for example, while the individual effects of the increasing number of chemicals, including pesticides, are relatively well-known, their impacts in combination remain largely unknown.   [4]       Figure 1: World premature deaths due to urban pollution from particulate matter and ground-level ozone (20002050) [7]             Source: OECD environmental outlook to 2050 -  [a] and  [b]    Note:  BRIICS countries are: Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China, South Africa     Growing antibiotic resistance,  partly due to evolution though overuse and over prescription, and the widespread use of antibiotics in intensive animal rearing are also culpable, is increasingly of concern, but research is lagging. [4][16]  Concerns exist over the profitability of developing narrow-, rather than broad-spectrum drugs, and of a rich-country bias preventing medical spending that benefits the developing world.    Competition for global resources is expected to indirectly impact health. Continued exploitation of global fish stocks, for example, and increased ocean  acidification  could remove this critical food source from vulnerable populations  marine fish currently provide 6 % of global protein ( GMTs 9 , 10 ). [17]    Trends    Non-communicable disease. In 2008, NCDs accounted for 36 million premature deaths, and are likely to cause 55 million by 2030.  [18]   Long predominant in developed countries, NCDs became the leading disease burden in developing countries in 2010 (Figure 3).   Cardiovascular disease   and cancers are the biggest cause of mortality worldwide  [19]   and diabetes, to which the socially disadvantaged are most vulnerable, is projected to affect 471 million by 2035.  [20]   Senile dementia currently affects 44 million people and is projected to rise to 135million worldwide by 2050, with 96 million of them in developing countries.  [21]     Lifestyle NCDs are increasing but are preventable  tobacco accounts for almost 6 million premature deaths a year, projected to rise to 8 million by 2030; around 3.2 million annually are attributable to insufficient physical activity and about 1.7 million to low fruit and vegetable consumption. [22]     Currently 10 % of the worlds adults are obese, and, in 2012, more than 40 million children under the age of 5 were either overweight or obese. In developing countries with emerging economies, particularly in  urban areas , the rate of increase in these problems is 30 % higher than in developed ones. [23]       Communicable disease.In spite of the ongoing decline of communicable diseases (Figure 2), they still pose a significant threat to human health and international health security, especially in developing countries.  [26]  Even in developed countries, communicable diseases have not been completely eradicated, and in some cases their incidence is growing, mainly due to the emergence of drug-resistant disease strains. For example, tuberculosis has re-emerged in some developed countries where it had historically been reduced to very low levels.  [27]  In 2012, 8.6 million people globally were living with tuberculosis, and 1.3 million people died from it. In the same year, there were 35.3 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, and 1.7 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses, including 230 000 children. Due to better access to therapy, the number of new HIV infections and deaths due to AIDS is decreasing globally, while the number of people living with HIV/AIDS is increasing.  [28]     HIV/AIDS has received much attention in the developing world, but many developing countries face neglected tropical diseases, a group of parasitic and bacterial diseases such as dengue and leprosy. Vaccination programmes and other health responses for these diseases do exist, but they are often poorly and inadequately administered. Additionally, several contagious diseases persist despite the availability of an effective vaccine for over 50 years. One example is measles, a highly contagious disease that remains one of the leading causes of death among young children, particularly in developing countries.   Figure 2: The change in the global burden of disease and share of non-communicable diseases by world regions (19902030) [24][25]             Source: IHME  Global health data exchange database  (left panel); WHO Global health estimates -  [c] and  [d] (right panel) Note:  DALY refers to Disability Adjusted Life Years, defined by WHO as the sum of  Years of potential life lost due to premature mortality and the years of productive life lost due to disability.     Pandemics. Some infections have the potential to cause pandemics  made more likely by high levels of international travel and migration;  [29]   the ability of some viruses to mutate rapidly and jump from animals to humans; and antibiotic resistance.  [30]   The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that the world is 'ill-prepared to respond to severe pandemics  threatening public health emergency'.  [31]    Health inequalities. Although life expectancy and health have improved globally over the last decades, significant differences still exist between and within countries, urban and rural areas, and different income-level groups. Indeed, about 75 % of all premature deaths in 2010 occurred in developing countries.  [4]     Health care services also vary: there are 33 physicians per 10 000 people in Europe, 5.5in southeast Asia and 2.5 in Africa. The high cost of medical care is another cause for concern  WHO suggests that around 150 million people face financial ruin each year from having to pay for medical services. [32]     Implications    Changes in disease burden could strain health systems and costs, deepen inequalities and increase poverty. If current demographic, urbanisation and health trends continue ( GMTs 1 , 2 ) developing countries will have to deal with a multiple burden of NCDs, communicable disease and pandemics, especially in slums of burgeoning urban areas. [33]     The finances of developing countries may be threatened by NCDs  in countries in all income groups, productivity losses from NCDs are already greater than public health spending.In 2013, WHO warned that business-as-usual will increase productivity losses and health care costs everywhere, with the cost of inaction far outweighing that of taking action. [7][33]      In developed countries, costs related to ageing populations and health could increase fiscal pressure and affect social cohesion and well-being (  GMT 1  ). [34]     An integrated approach to health encompassing health inequalities, social, economic and environmental factors is key. Both WHO [33]  and the United Nation Development Programme [35]  agree that improving human development requires increased investment in health as well as infrastructure, education, and  governance .    With more than 70 % of people projected to live in cities by 2050, good governance in urban areas will benefit both the environment and public health. [3]  In rural areas, the interactions of wildlife, domesticated animals and human health pose growing risks of disease, which should be tackled by addressing the connections between them and ecosystem health. [36]     European countries  improved public health in recent decades, and have relatively strong social safety nets and public healthcare systems. Nonetheless, significant health inequalities remain within and across countries  and have increased since 2006 [37] , with poor families disproportionally affected by the recent economic crises. [4]    In Europe, including Russia, NCDs cause 86 % of premature deaths,  [38]  with ambient air and noise pollution and antibiotic resistance of particular concern.  [3][39]    The health impacts of  climate change  are of particular concern for the elderly and vulnerable [40]  while rising temperatures are also likely to bring new vector-borne diseases. [4]  These factors, coupled with the increasing cost of long-term care and the decline in informal care for the elderly, threaten the affordability of technical advances, unless the EU addresses the underlying causes of ill health, including the influence of an ageing population, globalisation and environmental degradation. [4][36][41],Drivers Environmental degradation, climate change, and increased urbanisation, mobility and migration all influence public health,[1][2]for example by raising the risk of the global transfer of infectious disease and exposing people to environmental hazards (GMTs 1,2,8,10).[3][4] Elderly and poor people are particularly vulnerable.

In developing countries with emerging economies, particularly in urban areas, the rate of increase in these problems is 30 % higher than in developed ones.[23]  Communicable disease.In spite of the ongoing decline of communicable diseases (Figure 2), they still pose a significant threat to human health and international health security, especially in developing countries.[26]Even in developed countries, communicable diseases have not been completely eradicated, and in some cases their incidence is growing, mainly due to the emergence of drug-resistant disease strains. For example, tuberculosis has re-emerged in some developed countries where it had historically been reduced to very low levels.[27]In 2012, 8.6 million people globally were living with tuberculosis, and 1.3 million people died from it. In the same year, there were 35.3 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, and 1.7 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses, including 230 000 children. Due to better access to therapy, the number of new HIV infections and deaths due to AIDS is decreasing globally, while the number of people living with HIV/AIDS is increasing.[28] HIV/AIDS has received much attention in the developing world, but many developing countries face neglected tropical diseases, a group of parasitic and bacterial diseases such as dengue and leprosy. Vaccination programmes and other health responses for these diseases do exist, but they are often poorly and inadequately administered. Additionally, several contagious diseases persist despite the availability of an effective vaccine for over 50 years. One example is measles, a highly contagious disease that remains one of the leading causes of death among young children, particularly in developing countries. Figure 2: The change in the global burden of disease and share of non-communicable diseases by world regions (19902030)[24][25]  Source: IHME Global health data exchange database (left panel); WHO Global health estimates - [c]and [d](right panel)Note: DALY refers to Disability Adjusted Life Years, defined by WHO as the sum ofYears of potential life lost due to premature mortality and the years of productive life lost due to disability. Pandemics.Some infections have the potential to cause pandemics  made more likely by high levels of international travel and migration;[29] the ability of some viruses to mutate rapidly and jump from animals to humans; and antibiotic resistance.[30] The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that the world is 'ill-prepared to respond to severe pandemics  threatening public health emergency'.[31] Health inequalities.Although life expectancy and health have improved globally over the last decades, significant differences still exist between and within countries, urban and rural areas, and different income-level groups. Indeed, about 75 % of all premature deaths in 2010 occurred in developing countries.[4] Health care services also vary: there are 33 physicians per 10 000 people in Europe, 5.5in southeast Asia and 2.5 in Africa. The high cost of medical care is another cause for concern  WHO suggests that around 150 million people face financial ruin each year from having to pay for medical services.[32] Implications  Changes in disease burden could strain health systems and costs, deepen inequalities and increase poverty. If current demographic, urbanisation and health trends continue (GMTs 1,2) developing countries will have to deal with a multiple burden of NCDs, communicable disease and pandemics, especially in slums of burgeoning urban areas.[33] The finances of developing countries may be threatened by NCDs  in countries in all income groups, productivity losses from NCDs are already greater than public health spending.In 2013, WHO warned that business-as-usual will increase productivity losses and health care costs everywhere, with the cost of inaction far outweighing that of taking action.[7][33] In developed countries, costs related to ageing populations and health could increase fiscal pressure and affect social cohesion and well-being (GMT 1).[34] An integrated approach to health encompassing health inequalities, social, economic and environmental factors is key. Both WHO[33] and the United Nation Development Programme[35] agree that improving human development requires increased investment in health as well as infrastructure, education, and governance. With more than 70 % of people projected to live in cities by 2050, good governance in urban areas will benefit both the environment and public health.[3] In rural areas, the interactions of wildlife, domesticated animals and human health pose growing risks of disease, which should be tackled by addressing the connections between them and ecosystem health.[36] European countries improved public health in recent decades, and have relatively strong social safety nets and public healthcare systems. Nonetheless, significant health inequalities remain within and across countries  and have increased since 2006[37], with poor families disproportionally affected by the recent economic crises.[4] In Europe, including Russia, NCDs cause 86 % of premature deaths,[38]with ambient air and noise pollution and antibiotic resistance of particular concern.[3][39] The health impacts of climate change are of particular concern for the elderly and vulnerable[40] while rising temperatures are also likely to bring new vector-borne diseases.[4] These factors, coupled with the increasing cost of long-term care and the decline in informal care for the elderly, threaten the affordability of technical advances, unless the EU addresses the underlying causes of ill health, including the influence of an ageing population, globalisation and environmental degradation.[4][36][41]"
"consumption  Consumption  socio-economy consumer behaviour sustainable consumption and production consumption patterns household consumption        Context    Global systems of production and consumption generate a complex mixture of environmental, social and economic costs and benefits  supporting livelihoods across the value chain, but also accounting for much of  humanity's burden on the environment. Managing the diverse impacts is a central challenge in the  transition to a green economy .   Efforts to monitor and manage society's pressures on the environment have tended to focus on production.   Yet there are good reasons for considering consumption inboth analysis and policy tobe of equal importance.     First, improving the  resource efficiency  of production may not, by itself, cause absolute reductions in resource use or impacts. This is because efficiency improvements tend to lead to lower production costs and prices, incentivising increased production and consumption (a process sometimes referred to as the 'rebound effect').    Second,  market prices often provide little indication to consumers and regulators about the environmental and social impacts that occur across complex globalised supply chains.  Additional measures are therefore needed to guide consumers towards more sustainable choices.   Third, while governments have limited ability to influence production processes in other countries, efforts directed at consumption can influence impacts across the entire l ife-cycle of products  and services.Measures targeting consumption therefore have the potential to extend the reach of government policy, influencing resource use and production phase impacts across the world.      Consumption is today recognised as a core concern in long-term environmental and development strategies.   Globally, governments at the Rio+20 Conference in 2012 adopted the '10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production'. The programmes set objectives and define activities and indicators, addressing issues such as sustainable lifestyles, education,  tourism  and buildings. [ 1 ]    In the EU, the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe [ 2]   provides a framework for policies addressing production and consumption, and defines milestones to be met by 2020, for example phasing out environmentally harmful subsidies by 2020.   More recently, the 7th Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) is the first EU policy to include goals on reducing environmental pressures caused by European consumption, including impacts outside EU borders. [ 3]        Trends   Consumption expenditure trends   Consumption consists of household final consumption expenditure (i.e. all purchases by resident households to meet their everyday needs) and government final consumption expenditure (i.e. goods and services provided to citizens and financed by tax revenues). This assessment focuses on   household consumption  , which accounts for approximately 60% of EU-28 gross domestic product (GDP), compared to about 20% for government consumption.    Household consumption expenditure in the EU-28, Iceland and Norway grew roughly in line with economic output in the period 19962012, increasing by 23% in real terms despite a slight fall following the economic crisis. EU-28 per capita household consumption expenditure was EUR 14500in 2012. [ 4 ]    Three broad consumption categories housingand utilities, mobility, and food account for approximately half of European household expenditure (Figure 1) and more than two-thirds of the direct and indirect  environmental pressures caused by household consumption . [ 5 ][ 6 ][ 7 ]  The EU prioritised these categories for action in the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe and the 7th EAP in view of their comparatively large life-cycle impacts.    Figure 1: Share of expenditure on household consumption categories        Europe'sglobal footprint   The resources and emissions caused during the production of products and services can be estimated using 'environmentallyextended input-output analysis'.According to this method, most of the global environmental pressures associated with EU-27 household consumption declined or grew less rapidly than household expenditure between 1996 and 2009. Only water use increased more than expenditure in this period (Figure 2).   The dominant cause of this  decoupling of pressures from expenditure was improved eco-efficiency in the production of goods and services, rather than changing consumption patterns . [ 5 ]       Figure 2: Environmental footprint of household purchases of goods and services        The growth in  greenhouse gas (  GHG)  emissions illustrated in Figure 2 contrasts with the decreasing trends for EU emissions calculated using production-based methods.  [8]   However, some uncertainties still remain with calculating the environmental pressures from consumption, and further development of tools and methodologies is needed.   While acknowledging these limitations, the data do indicate that an increasing proportion of the environmental pressures linked to European demand occurs in other parts of the world. In 1995, 13%of GHG emissions caused by EU domestic final demand (i.e. total consumption and investment expenditures) were released outside the EU during the production of goods exported to the EU. By 2008, this had risen to 24%(Figure3).Thefigures are higher for other pressures. [ 9 ]    Figure 3: Percentage of the EU footprint exerted outside EU borders        For some categories of goods and services a substantial proportion of final consumption is supplied directly by imported goods. Imports accounted for 87%of EU clothing expenditure in 2012, rising from 65%in 2005. Imports of electrical and electronic products accounted for 74%of EU consumption in 2012, up from 50%in 2007. Net imports of these products are somewhat lower but they are also increasing.  [ 9 ]        Measures that alter European consumption can influence related environmental pressures globally. However, such gains may be offset by increased pressures elsewhere if consumption-oriented approaches are not complemented by broader efforts to reorganise production-consumption systems. For example, reducing food waste can reduce demand for agricultural resources, alleviating associated environmental impacts. But it may also leave a consumer with extra resources to spend on other consumption categories, resulting in a form of rebound effect.  [ 10 ]     Prospects   Global economic output is projected to triple in the period 20102050, [ 11 ] implying greatly increased competition for resources. In this context, Europe will need to find ways to adapt its consumption patterns as part of broader efforts to alleviate environmental pressures. A variety of approaches exist to make consumption patterns more sustainable. Some are already firmly established in EU policy, such as the Ecodesign Directive, the Energy Labelling Directive,  [ 12 ]  the Ecolabel Regulation,  [ 13 ]  and the Green Public Procurement Communication.  [ 14 ]  The European Commission has also adopted a harmonised method to calculate the environmental performance of products and organisations.  [ 15 ]  This method will help deliver more credible information to all stakeholders, including consumers.    While these approaches are important, substantially reducing the European environmental footprint will require deeper changes in lifestyles, including in the size and location of dwellings, commuting patterns and diets. Government measures are only part of the solution in effecting such  transitions.  Consumption patterns  are shaped by multiple drivers, including income levels, prices and social norms. Producers play a crucial role in determining these factors, for example via innovation and advertising. Reshaping consumption therefore involves a complex interaction between governments, businesses and consumers.    Consumers can have a significant influence over production-phase impacts via their purchasing decisions, thereby incentivising corporate social responsibility and sustainable supply-chain management. Businesses can work towards transparent, sustainable supply chains and apply ecodesign and dematerialisation strategies in product design. They can also shape consumer choices via marketing and use of certification. [ 16 ]    Government policy at all levels can help incentivise social and technical innovation through the introduction of regulations and market-based incentives. For example, within the waste policy framework, bottom-up initiatives have emerged to enable waste prevention, repair and reuse. This has occurred via increased donation, sale and purchase of second-hand goods.     Collaborative consumption       initiatives are likewise proliferating in many European countries. Such approaches could reduce the resource-intensity of consumption by meeting consumer needs through leasing, product-service systems and sharing arrangements, rather than purchases. Shifting away from a logic of maximising product sales towards one of service provision can fundamentally alter the incentives driving product development, encouraging a greater focus on durability and reparability. [ 17 ][ 18 ]     There are many business opportunities within such new approaches, as well as opportunities to build social capital at the community level. [ 19 ]  Policies should enable and encourage initiatives with the highest potential to reduce overall environmental impacts from European consumption, and support up-scaling by developing favourable framework conditions. Structured monitoring of these innovations and their environmental effects, including possible rebound effects, will be crucial.,Context Global systems of production and consumption generate a complex mixture of environmental, social and economic costs and benefits supportinglivelihoods across the value chain, but also accounting for much of humanity'sburden on the environment.

"urban-world  Towards a more urban world (GMT 2)  global megatrends urban    Drivers    Growing global urbanisation is driven by developing-world  industrialisation , agricultural mechanisation, and environmental change, but above all by growth of the global population. Today there are 7 billion people, but 8.310.9 billion are expected by 2050, with a medium variant of 9.6 billion( GMT 1 ). [1]    Developed countries, searching for lower-cost production, increasingly source materials, products, components and services from the developing world. Just as trade and industry grew Europe's cities, developing-world suppliers are driving the growth of theirs. One industry attracts others, and workers, too, need products and services  building a virtuous cycle of development [2]   Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers suggest that as a city's population doubles, economic productivity increases by 130 %.  [3]   This is now occurring in Africa, Asia and Latin America.   As happened in the developed world, advanced, industrial agricultural techniques, requiring fewer but highly skilled workers, are now being applied in the developing world, reducing the size of the workforce, depressing wages and stimulating large numbers of rural people to seek livelihoods in towns and cities.  [4]      Environmental degradation , often linked to global, regional and national patterns of production and consumption ( GMT 10 ), increasingly fosters internal and international urban immigration from rural areas. This can be particularly severe in rural areas and societies with a direct dependency on local natural resources.SubSaharan Africa and parts of south-east Asia, where high population growth coincides with a direct dependency on forests, fisheries, freshwater, etc. may be particularly hard hit.  [5]     Trends   Although urban areas  [6]  cover just 2.8 % of the global land area, they are home to more than half the world's population  around 3.5 billion people.  [7]   In 1950, only around 700 million people lived in cities, while by 2050 about two-thirds of the world's expected population, probably 6.2 billion people, are projected to be urban (Figure 1). Between now and 2050, using the UN's median variant, the world's population is expected to rise by about 2.7 billion people, of whom 2.3 billion are projected to live in developing world urban areas, mostly Africa and Asia, swelling the population of developing world cities to 8.2 billion ( GMT 1 ). [8]   Urbanisation  can blur the divides between urban and rural areas, creating ever-larger and ever-more important peri-urban areas  [9]  , with their own range of specific characteristics, problems and opportunities.  [10]     Figure 1: Urban and rural population in developed and less developed world regions, 1950-2050 [8]            Source:  UN World urbanization prospects: The 2012revision     Currently, 80 % of North America's, South America and the Caribbean's population is urban;70 % in Europe, 40 % in Africa and 48 % in Asia.  [11][12]   However, the latter two regions are urbanising rapidly (Figure 2).   Africa presently has 400 million urban inhabitants, 11 % of the world's urban population, but by 2050 this is expected to rise to 2 billion, 32 %, with most of the growth happening in slums.  [11]         Asia presently has 1.8 billion people living in cities, 51% of the world's urban population, estimated to rise to 3.3 billion, 53 %, by 2050, mostly in the large cities of China and India.  [8][12]   But even allowing for the rapid pace of developing-world urbanisation, developed countries will become more urbanised by 2050, with rates of 86 % of their population urban, compared to 64 % in the developing-world (Figure 2). [11]    Figure 2: Urban trends by world regions, 1950-2050 [8]            Source:   UN World urbanization prospects: The 2012revision     Tokyo and New York were the only megacities, with more than 10 million inhabitants, in 1970; by 2014 there were 28, most of which were located in the global south; and, by 2030 there could be 41 globally.  [12]   Nonetheless, small and medium sized cities have always been the engine of urbanisation, and although the population of megacities is projected to double by 2025, the largest number of urban dwellers will live in cities of fewer than 500 000 people. Today, 12 % of the world urban population lives in megacities while about half live in these smaller cities. [12]    Urban density varies from 135 people per hectare in some developing countries, through 70 in most of developed ones to 28 in such land-rich countries as Australia, Canada and the US. In the next 30 years, a doubling of urban populations in developing countries is likely to triple the extent of built-up areas, [13]  while in developed countries, population increase, combined with a demand for more single-person houses, may result in competition for urban  green infrastructure . [14]    Urban areas currently generate around 80 % of world gross domestic product, with much of this held by the middle class, [15]  a group likely to grow by more than 170 % to 4.9 billion by 2030, with Asia accounting for 85% of the growth (Figure 3). These citizens have the resources to invest in human and physical capital, providing access to a wide range of goods and services, potentially alleviating insecurity associated with poverty ( GMT 3 ). [16]    Figure 3: Middle class consumption, 1965-2030 [16]            Source:    Development, Aid and Governance Indicators (DAGI)    Note:The 15 chosen EU countries are: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom. No Chinese data for 1965.    In the next 30 years, the doubling of urban populations in  developing countries  is likely to triple the extent of built-up areas.  [10]  This relative spatial inefficiency is linked to the fact that most future urbanisation is likely to be  informal settlements and slums  often with inadequate housing, safe drinking water, sanitation or waste disposal. Slums have always been a part of rapid urbanisation, but their current scale is unprecedented  almost 1 billion people live in them; in some African countries more than 90 % of urban residents. [17] If not addressed, the UN estimates that the number of slum dwellers will rise to 3 billion by 2050. [18]     Implications   Highly urbanised countries tend to have high levels of human development, [19]  but 6080 % of all resource consumption and energy use, while around half the world's  anthropogenic  carbon dioxide emissions and environmental/ecosystem degradation can be attributed to cities. [12][20][21][22]  Indeed, China's urban areas alone are projected to consume 20 % of the world's energy by 2030. [11]    If well managed, however, resource efficient cities can combine productivity increases and innovation with reduced environmental impacts as major cities tend to generate higher economic output at far lower per person  greenhouse gas emissions  [21][23]  and lower per person consumption of resources. Indeed UNEP [21]  suggests that dense, mixed-use urban settlements can be more resource-efficient than any other with similar levels of economic output. How this potential is used depends on  urban planning , as sprawl hinders cities in fulfilling their environmental and resource efficiency potential.   Poorly planned, dense urban settlements, however, bring congestion, overcrowding, pressure on infrastructure and the environment, and higher housing costs. [24]  The concentration of people and businesses can also significantly undermine health, making it easier for disease to spread ( GMTs 3 , 10 ).   The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) argues that population growth, increasing urbanisation, which raises dependency on food purchases, and changing diets are among the factors impacting global food demand, driving countries to seek resources elsewhere. [25]  Increased urbanisation and changing  consumption patterns  are also having a significant impact on the quantity and quality of water resources. [26]    Compact, densely populated cities are the most efficient and sustainable model for housing a rapidly growing population and the integrated management of urban activities and natural capital, green infrastructure and biodiversity facilitates future urban planning. The provision and maintenance of green spaces is key, as these provide regulating services, tackling  air pollution  and reducing flooding for example, encourage  biodiversity  and, if carefully planned, act as wildlife corridors as well providing cultural and recreational opportunities for people. [7][14]    City governance affects urbanisation. The most successful manages rapid growth at different spatial levels: adequate service provision, urban sprawl, spatial disparities, congestion, pollution,  climate change , social issues and distressed areas. Examples of good governance show the success of cities that go beyond the traditional issues of infrastructure management to include such broader elements as the knowledge and skills of workers, and the social capital needed to encourage innovation ( GMT 4 ). [26][27]    Europe   The interconnectedness of natural systems makes it inevitable that environmental impacts arising elsewhere in the world will affect Europe and its cities, especially  air pollution  and the rise in greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed, research suggests their increase in developing countries could offset Europe's efforts to  mitigate climate change . Moreover, because Europe is relatively resource poor, it is increasingly dependent on imports of fossil fuel, minerals and food, and vulnerable to competition for them ( GMTs 7 , 8 ). While the cities of northern Europe are likely to be relatively resilient to this, those in east and south are less so. [11]    As  urban development  is Europe's fastest-growing category of land-use change, with peri-urban areas growing at four faster then urban ones, [10] these issues suggest that Europe should embrace the integrated management of urban activities and natural capital, green infrastructure and biodiversity, as well as technological change, to sustain their competitiveness, foster agglomeration economies and increase  resource efficiency .,Drivers  Growing global urbanisation is driven by developing-world industrialisation, agricultural mechanisation, and environmental change, but above all by growth of the global population. Today there are 7 billion people, but 8.310.9 billion are expected by 2050, with a medium variant of 9.6 billion(GMT 1).[1] Developed countries, searching for lower-cost production, increasingly source materials, products, components and services from the developing world.

As happened in the developed world, advanced, industrial agricultural techniques, requiring fewer but highly skilled workers, are now being applied in the developing world, reducing the size of the workforce, depressing wages and stimulating large numbers of rural people to seek livelihoods in towns and cities.[4] Environmental degradation, often linked to global, regional and national patterns of production and consumption (GMT 10), increasingly fosters internal and international urban immigration from rural areas. This can be particularly severe in rural areas and societies with a direct dependency on local natural resources.SubSaharan Africa and parts of south-east Asia, where high population growth coincides with a direct dependency on forests, fisheries, freshwater, etc. may be particularly hard hit.[5] Trends Although urban areas[6]cover just 2.8 % of the global land area, they are home to more than half the world's population  around 3.5 billion people.[7] In 1950, only around 700 million people lived in cities, while by 2050 about two-thirds of the world's expected population, probably 6.2 billion people, are projected to be urban (Figure 1). Between now and 2050, using the UN's median variant, the world's population is expected to rise by about 2.7 billion people, of whom 2.3 billion are projected to live in developing world urban areas, mostly Africa and Asia, swelling the population of developing world cities to 8.2 billion (GMT 1).[8] Urbanisation can blur the divides between urban and rural areas, creating ever-larger and ever-more important peri-urban areas[9], with their own range of specific characteristics, problems and opportunities.[10] Figure 1: Urban and rural population in developed and less developed world regions, 1950-2050[8]  Source: UN World urbanization prospects: The 2012revision Currently, 80 % of North America's, South America and the Caribbean's population is urban;70 % in Europe, 40 % in Africa and 48 % in Asia.[11][12] However, the latter two regions are urbanising rapidly (Figure 2). Africa presently has 400 million urban inhabitants, 11 % of the world's urban population, but by 2050 this is expected to rise to 2 billion, 32 %, with most of the growth happening in slums.[11] Asia presently has 1.8 billion people living in cities, 51% of the world's urban population, estimated to rise to 3.3 billion, 53 %, by 2050, mostly in the large cities of China and India.[8][12] But even allowing for the rapid pace of developing-world urbanisation, developed countries will become more urbanised by 2050, with rates of 86 % of their population urban, compared to 64 % in the developing-world (Figure 2).[11] Figure 2: Urban trends by world regions, 1950-2050[8]  Source:UN World urbanization prospects: The 2012revision Tokyo and New York were the only megacities, with more than 10 million inhabitants, in 1970; by 2014 there were 28, most of which were located in the global south; and, by 2030 there could be 41 globally.[12] Nonetheless, small and medium sized cities have always been the engine of urbanisation, and although the population of megacities is projected to double by 2025, the largest number of urban dwellers will live in cities of fewer than 500 000 people. Today, 12 % of the world urban population lives in megacities while about half live in these smaller cities.[12] Urban density varies from 135 people per hectare in some developing countries, through 70 in most of developed ones to 28 in such land-rich countries as Australia, Canada and the US. In the next 30 years, a doubling of urban populations in developing countries is likely to triple the extent of built-up areas,[13] while in developed countries, population increase, combined with a demand for more single-person houses, may result in competition for urban green infrastructure.[14] Urban areas currently generate around 80 % of world gross domestic product, with much of this held by the middle class,[15] a group likely to grow by more than 170 % to 4.9 billion by 2030, with Asia accounting for 85% of the growth (Figure 3). These citizens have the resources to invest in human and physical capital, providing access to a wide range of goods and services, potentially alleviating insecurity associated with poverty (GMT 3).[16] Figure 3: Middle class consumption, 1965-2030[16]  Source: Development, Aid and Governance Indicators (DAGI)Note:The 15 chosen EU countries are: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom. No Chinese data for 1965. In the next 30 years, the doubling of urban populations in developing countries is likely to triple the extent of built-up areas.[10] This relative spatial inefficiency is linked to the fact that most future urbanisation is likely to be informal settlements and slums often with inadequate housing, safe drinking water, sanitation or waste disposal. Slums have always been a part of rapid urbanisation, but their current scale is unprecedented  almost 1 billion people live in them; in some African countries more than 90 % of urban residents.[17]If not addressed, the UN estimates that the number of slum dwellers will rise to 3 billion by 2050.[18] Implications Highly urbanised countries tend to have high levels of human development,[19] but 6080 % of all resource consumption and energy use, while around half the world's anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions and environmental/ecosystem degradation can be attributed to cities.[12][20][21][22] Indeed, China's urban areas alone are projected to consume 20 % of the world's energy by 2030.[11] If well managed, however, resource efficient cities can combine productivity increases and innovation with reduced environmental impacts as major cities tend to generate higher economic output at far lower per person greenhouse gas emissions[21][23] and lower per person consumption of resources. Indeed UNEP[21] suggests that dense, mixed-use urban settlements can be more resource-efficient than any other with similar levels of economic output. How this potential is used depends on urban planning, as sprawl hinders cities in fulfilling their environmental and resource efficiency potential. Poorly planned, dense urban settlements, however, bring congestion, overcrowding, pressure on infrastructure and the environment, and higher housing costs.[24] The concentration of people and businesses can also significantly undermine health, making it easier for disease to spread (GMTs 3,10). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) argues that population growth, increasing urbanisation, which raises dependency on food purchases, and changing diets are among the factors impacting global food demand, driving countries to seek resources elsewhere.[25] Increased urbanisation and changing consumption patterns are also having a significant impact on the quantity and quality of water resources.[26] Compact, densely populated cities are the most efficient and sustainable model for housing a rapidly growing population and the integrated management of urban activities and natural capital, green infrastructure and biodiversity facilitates future urban planning. The provision and maintenance of green spaces is key, as these provide regulating services, tackling air pollution and reducing flooding for example, encourage biodiversity and, if carefully planned, act as wildlife corridors as well providing cultural and recreational opportunities for people.[7][14] City governance affects urbanisation. The most successful manages rapid growth at different spatial levels: adequate service provision, urban sprawl, spatial disparities, congestion, pollution, climate change, social issues and distressed areas. Examples of good governance show the success of cities that go beyond the traditional issues of infrastructure management to include such broader elements as the knowledge and skills of workers, and the social capital needed to encourage innovation (GMT 4).[26][27] Europe The interconnectedness of natural systems makes it inevitable that environmental impacts arising elsewhere in the world will affect Europe and its cities, especially air pollution and the rise in greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed, research suggests their increase in developing countries could offset Europe's efforts to mitigate climate change. Moreover, because Europe is relatively resource poor, it is increasingly dependent on imports of fossil fuel, minerals and food, and vulnerable to competition for them (GMTs 7,8). While the cities of northern Europe are likely to be relatively resilient to this, those in east and south are less so.[11] As urban development is Europe's fastest-growing category of land-use change, with peri-urban areas growing at four faster then urban ones,[10]these issues suggest that Europe should embrace the integrated management of urban activities and natural capital, green infrastructure and biodiversity, as well as technological change, to sustain their competitiveness, foster agglomeration economies and increase resource efficiency."
"sweden  Sweden  country briefings     Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report     Sweden has environmental objectivesof three different kinds,a generational goal,milestone targets and quality objectives.The generational goal focuses environmental efforts on the recovery of ecosystems, conserving biodiversity and the natural and cultural environment, good human health, efficient materials cycles free from dangerous substances, sustainable use of natural resources, efficient energy use and patterns of consumption.   The 16 environmental quality objectives (box 1) should be achieved by 2020  [1]  .     Box 1. Sweden's environmental quality objectives   The Swedish parliament has adopted 16 objectives for environmental quality in Sweden     Reduced climate impact   Clean air   Natural acidification only   A non-toxic environment   A protective ozone layer   A safe radiation environment   Zero eutrophication   Flourishing lakes and streams   Good-quality groundwater   A balanced marine environment, flourishing coastal areas and archipelagos   Thriving wetlands   Sustainable forests   A varied agricultural landscape   A magnificent mountain landscape   A good built environment   A rich diversity of plant and animal life      Every four years, an in-depth evaluation is undertaken. The latest, in 2012, was conducted in collaboration with all relevant government agencies, together with stakeholder and environmental organisations.  [2]   In addition, an annual follow-up of the objectives  [3]  takes place which provides a basis for the Government's progress report to the Parliament, and also formes part of the background material for the Budget Bill.   Various tools are used to assess progress, including indicators that reflect trends in relation to the different objectives. The Environmental Objectives Portal is an on-line gateway to information about Sweden's environmental objectives and progress towards achieving them.  [4]         Key findings of the State of Environment report    Current state of the environment   For most of the environmental quality objectives the situation is complex, with positive trends for some components of them, but more negative trends for others. Certain emissions, e.g.of phosphorus, nitrogen, sulphur dioxide and lead, have been reduced to some extent, but in some areas the beneficial effects, for instance on air quality, acidification and eutrophication, are taking time to emerge. This is due to nature's slow capacity for recovery and the complex relationships between emissions and levels in the environment. Levels of some toxic pollutants are declining, but persistent ones are a major problem.   Global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) are rising, and future climate change will have negative implications for many of the environmental quality objectives. However, Swedish emissions continue to fall and preliminary data for 2013 [5]  show the lowest level since the 1990 base year (figure 1). While emissions of GHG have decreased in Sweden, emissions in other countries as a result of Swedish consumption have increased.   Figure 1: Greenhouse gas emissions, 1990-2013        Note:Total Swedish Greenhouse gas emissions, excl LULUCF and International Bunkers. Units  million tonnes CO 2 -equivalent. Preliminary data for 2013. Data source:  Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, 2014     Certain aspects of the environmental status of seas, lakes, watercourses and groundwaters, and of several terrestrial ecosystems, remain problematic, not least as regards eutrophication and biodiversity.   While the overall situation regarding the environmental quality objectives is negative, trends in the state of the environment vary from one objective to another. The goals with the most negative trends are 'Reduced Climate Impact', 'Thriving Wetlands', 'A Varied Agricultural Landscape' and 'A Rich Diversity of Plant and Animal Life'. The objectives 'Clean Air', 'Natural Acidification Only', 'Good-Quality Groundwater' and 'A Magnificent Mountain Landscape', on the other hand, show positive trends, albeit weak.      Conditions for meeting the objectives   An evaluation and assessment of external factors shaping progress, such as the world economy, political developments and EU decisions, as well as of the effects of policy instruments and measures, conflicts between policy areas and the influence of different agencies and stakeholders, requires a far-reaching analysis of complex relationships.At a more general levelthe most important background factors affecting progress towards the objectivesinclude a need for international policy instruments,common EU policies,a need for initiatives in other policy areas besides environmental policy, implementation of legislation, collaboration, and public agencies' resources for environmental action.   Another way of looking at the conditions for meeting the objectives is to study the underlying reasons why they are not being achieved. There are many such reasons;one is increased pressure on resources,having a negative impact via forestry, agriculture and energy production. High living standards and high levels of consumption affect both the situation in Sweden and the state of the environment abroad.     Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns       Parliamentary support and broad consensus are central to environmental work. The Cross-Party Committee on Environmental Objectivesadvises the Government on how theobjectives can be achieved and, in cooperation with agencies in the environmental objectives system, delivers proposals on strategies and milestone targets, policy instruments and measures in priority areas.   In 2015 the Government established an Environmental Objectives Council to strengthen the implementation of environmental policies. The Council is a platform for Heads of agencies that are strategically important for achieving environmental objectives.    Recent strategies from the government and strategies that are underway      In 2014 the Government adopted a strategy for biodiversity and ecosystem services  [6]  . The strategy has significance not only for many of theobjectives and the generational goal but also for the international Aichi targets adopted under the Convention on Biological Diversity, as well as the objectives of the EU biodiversity strategy.   In2013 the Government presented the strategyfor chemicals policy  [7]  . It is a strategy for how to achieve the environmental quality objective 'Non-Toxic Environment' as well as relevant parts of the generational goal.   In 2014 the Governmentinstructed the National Housing Board to develop a proposal for a strategy with milestones and measures to achieve theobjective 'A Good Built Environment' and the relevant parts of the generational goal.The task was reported in December 2014  [17]  .   In 2013 the Government instructed the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a proposal for a strategy with milestone targets, measures and instruments that will contribute to reaching theobjective 'A Magnificent Mountain Landscape'. The task wasreportedin June 2014 [8] .   In 2012 theCommittee on Environmental Objectives was tasked by the Government of drawing upa strategy for long-term sustainable land use and astrategy for a cohesive and sustainable water policy.A final report was presented inJune 2014 [9] .   The Milestone targets are intended to identify a desired social change and specify steps towards achieving the generational goal and one or more of the environmental quality objectives. They are to function as guidance to county administrative boards, government agencies, municipalities and the business sector on important priorities for continuing environmental action.Milestone targets can also be added to the environmental objectives system on the basis of goals adopted within the EU or by incorporating international agreements. As of March 2014 there are 24 adopted milestone targets, divided into five areas: climate, air pollution, dangerous substances, waste andbiodiversity  [10]  .    Country specific issues   The Government gives priority to efforts to reduce climate emissions, a toxic-free everyday environment, lakes and oceans, ecosystems and biodiversity.Below area few examples:   In 2015 the Government tasked the Committee on Environmental Objectives to propose a climate policy framework for Sweden [11] . This includes proposing a new long-term climate goal for Sweden's reduction of emissions of GHG by 2050 and a strategy with revised or new cost-effective and long-acting instruments and measures for different sectors of society. The task will be reported in February 2016.   The Government has instructed theChemicals Agency to produce an action plan for a toxic-free everyday environment  [12]  . This includesreporting on measures needed in the period 2011 - 2014 to reduce the risk faced by people in their everyday lives of being exposed to hazardous chemicals. Reducing the chemical risks in everyday life is a step towards attaining theobjective 'A Non-Toxic Environment'. The Government has decided to extend the work until 2020.   The Government proposed in2014 new regulations on the management of marine areas [13] . The purpose is to achieve a comprehensive ocean management in order to contribute to sustainable development of the oceans.One of the government decided milestones on biodiversity and ecosystem services  [10]  includes protection of the marine environment and the goal is to increase the protected areas by at least 570 000 hectares until 2020.   Anothermilestone on biodiversity and ecosystem services [10]  concerns the importance of biodiversity and the value of ecosystem services. It means that by 2018, the importance of biodiversity and the value of ecosystem services shall be widely known and integrated into economic standpoints, political considerations and other decisions in society where this is relevant and reasonably.   The aim of the recent w aste prevention programme  [14]  is to guide and inspire stakeholders so that environmental goals are achieved, so that less waste is generated and so that products are designed which contain no dangerous substances. There are four focus areas in the programme: food, textiles, electronics and construction & demolition. It contains eight objectives and 167 measures and complements the National Waste Plan  [15]  .    In an increasingly urbanized population experience from nature can lead to a greater understanding of nature's value for humans and for nature's own sake. In 2012 the Government presented objectives for outdoor recreation [16] . These are complementary to the environment quality objectives., Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report  Sweden has environmental objectivesof three different kinds,a generational goal,milestone targets and quality objectives.The generational goal focuses environmental efforts on the recovery of ecosystems, conserving biodiversity and the natural and cultural environment, good human health, efficient materials cycles free from dangerous substances, sustainable use of natural resources, efficient energy use and patterns of consumption.

"freshwater  Freshwater quality  water management water framework directive water pollution water quality freshwater environmental themes         Context      The continuing presence of pollutants in  Europe's waters  threatens aquatic ecosystems and raises concerns for  public health . Discharge from  urban wastewater  treatment, and industrial effluents and losses from farming, are the main sources for water pollution. For example,  agriculture causes widespread problems of  nutrient  enrichment in freshwater across Europe, despite recent improvements in some regions.   The main aim of European Union (EU) water policy is to ensure that throughout the EU, a sufficient quantity of good quality water is available for people's needs and for the environment. Since the first water directives in the 1970s, the EU has worked to create an effective and coherent water policy. The  Water Framework Directive (WFD) , which came into force in 2000, establishes a new framework for the assessment, management, protection and improvement of the quality of water resources across the EU.    EU Member States  should aim to achieve good status in all bodies of surface water and groundwater by 2015 unless there are grounds for exemption. Only in this case may achievement of good status be extended to 2021 or 2027 at the latest. Achieving good status involves meeting certain standards for the ecology, chemistry, morphology, and quantity of waters. In general terms, good status means that water shows only a slight change from what would normally be expected under undisturbed conditions (i.e. with a low human impact).   Water quantity and water quality are closely linked, and good ecological status depends as much on the quantitative water resource aspects as on its quality. In many locations, water demand often exceeds availability. Over-abstraction is causing low river flows, lower groundwater levels, and the drying-up of wetlands, which have detrimental impacts on freshwater ecosystems.  Climate change is projected to increase water shortages , particularly in the Mediterranean region. [ 1 ]    In 2010, EU Member States released 160 River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs), which contain plans for protecting and improving the water environment. The information in the RBMPs, together with other related sources of information, has been analysed to establish an assessment of the  status of and pressures affecting Europe's waters . Over the last few years,  European countries that are not EU Member States have developed similar river basin activities to those introduced by the Water Framework Directive .During 2015 EU Member States will finalise the second set of RBMPs. These will be the basis for an update of the status of Europe's waters and will illustrate progress in reducing pressures.      Key trends   Overall, more than half of the river and lake water bodies in Europe are reported to hold less than good ecological status or potential (Map 1). Ecological status is a criterion for the quality of the structure and functioning of surface water ecosystems. River water bodies are reported to have worse ecological status and more pressures and impacts than lakes.   The pressures reported to affect most surface water bodies are pollution from diffuse sources, in particular from  agriculture , causing nutrient enrichment. Hydromorphological pressures also affect many surface water bodies, mainly from hydropower, navigation, agriculture, flood protection and  urban development  resulting in altered habitats. A large proportion of water bodies have poor ecological status and are affected by pollution pressures, particularly in central and north-western European areas with intensive agricultural practices and high population density.   Map1: Proportion of classified river and lake water bodies in different River Basin Districts (RBD) holding less than good ecological status or potential          Source:  WISE WFD Database .    Many years of investment in the sewage system, and better wastewater treatment under the  Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive   t ogether with national legislation  have led to some remarkable improvements. Europe's waters are much cleaner today than they were 25 years ago when large quantities of untreated or partially treated urban and industrial wastewater were discharged into water.   Levels of oxygen-consuming substances (BOD5), ammonium, and phosphate decreased markedly in European rivers over the last two decades (Figure 1).   Figure 1: Changes in water quality variables during the last two decades          Modern-day agricultural practices often entail the intensive use of  fertilisers  and  manure , leading to high nutrient surpluses that are transferred to groundwater as well as surface water. About 25% of groundwater across Europe is classified as having poor chemical status, with nitrate being the primary cause. In European rivers, the nitrate concentration on average declined by 20% over the period 1992 to 2012 (Figure 1). This reflects the effect of measures to reduce agricultural inputs of nitrate at a European level (the Nitrates Directive) and at national level, as well as improvements in wastewater treatment.   The Bathing Water Directive and the Drinking Water Directive have, together with national measures, resulted in good  bathing water quality  and clean drinking water in Europe. Some sites (e.g. bathing waters polluted during heavy rain or some shallow wells) still have to improve their performance.    Hazardous substances in freshwater  resulting in poor chemical status can harm aquatic life and pose a risk to  human health  . The information provided in the RBMPs on chemical status is not sufficiently clear to establish a baseline for 2009. Hazardous substances are emitted to waters through a range of substances via many different pathways and from a variety of sources, including  industry  ,  agriculture  ,  transport  , mining and waste disposal, as well as from homes, where chemicals found in household products are discharged.  Pesticides  used in agriculture have been widely detected in surface water and groundwater. Mining, landfill sites, and contaminated land from historical industrial and military activities all exert a localised but significant  pressure upon waters in parts of Europe  .     If the morphology (structure) is degraded or the water flow (hydrology) is markedly changed, a water body with good water quality will not achieve its full potential as an   ecosystem  . For centuries humans have altered European surface waters (straightening and canalisation, disconnection of flood plains, land reclamations, dams, weirs, bank reinforcements, etc.) to facilitate agriculture and urbanisation and to produce energy and protect against flooding. There are several hundred thousand barriers and transverse structures in European rivers, and many water courses have had their seasonal or daily flow regimes changed. The WFD is the first piece of European environmental legislation that addresses hydromorphological modifications and their impacts on water bodies. The next RBMPs are obliged to include   measures to reduce hydromorphological pressures if they cause less than good ecological status  .    Prospects   The results from the first River Basin Management Plans showed that many European water bodies currently fail the WFD's objective of achieving good ecological and chemical status. In 2009, 43% of surface water bodies were in good or high ecological status, and in 2015, 53% of water bodies are expected to reach good ecological status. [ 2 ]  This is far from meeting the objective of good ecological status and only constitutes a modest improvement in ecological status.   To achieve good status, Member States will have to address the pressures affecting water bodies. Pollution is one pressure. Morphological changes, over-abstraction, and hydrological changes affecting water flow are others. While Member States are relatively clear about the types of pressures their river basins are encountering, precise information is missing on how these pressures will be addressed and to what extent the selected measures will contribute to the achievement of the environmental objectives in 2015.   Full implementation of the WFD throughout all sectors is needed to reduce the different pressures and to commit all users in a river basin to  focus on the achievement of healthy water bodies with good status . Although considerable success has been achieved in reducing the discharge of pollutants into Europe's waters in recent decades, challenges remain for urban and industrial wastewater and for pollution from agricultural sources. Wastewater treatment must continue to play a critical role in the protection of Europe's surface waters, and investment will be required to upgrade wastewater treatment and to maintain infrastructure in many European countries. Measures are needed to ensure the removal of emerging pollutants and to reduce storm water discharges.   Despite improvements in some regions, diffuse pollution from agriculture remains a major cause of the poor water quality currently observed in parts of Europe. Measures exist to tackle agricultural pollution and they need to be implemented. Full compliance with the Nitrates Directive is also required.  The new reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)  provides an opportunity to further strengthen water protection.   There are ample possibilities for improving  water management  through stringent and well-integrated implementation in order to achieve the objectives of the WFD. However, the next cycle of River Basin Management Plans, which will be agreed on in 2015, need to also take into account a wider consideration of  water resource management  as well as the  impacts of climate change .,Context The continuing presence of pollutants in Europe's waters threatens aquatic ecosystems and raises concerns for public health. Discharge from urban wastewater treatment, and industrial effluents and losses from farming, are the main sources for water pollution. For example, agriculturecauses widespread problems of nutrient enrichment in freshwater across Europe, despite recent improvements in some regions. The main aim of European Union (EU) water policy is to ensure that throughout the EU, a sufficient quantity of good quality water is available for people's needs and for the environment. Since the first water directives in the 1970s, the EU has worked to create an effective and coherent water policy. The Water Framework Directive (WFD), which came into force in 2000, establishes a new framework for the assessment, management, protection and improvement of the quality of water resources across the EU. EU Member States should aim to achieve good status in all bodies of surface water and groundwater by 2015 unless there are grounds for exemption. Only in this case may achievement of good status be extended to 2021 or 2027 at the latest. Achieving good status involves meeting certain standards for the ecology, chemistry, morphology, and quantity of waters. In general terms, good status means that water shows only a slight change from what would normally be expected under undisturbed conditions (i.e. with a low human impact). Water quantity and water quality are closely linked, and good ecological status depends as much on the quantitative water resource aspects as on its quality. In many locations, water demand often exceeds availability. Over-abstraction is causing low river flows, lower groundwater levels, and the drying-up of wetlands, which have detrimental impacts on freshwater ecosystems. Climate change is projected to increase water shortages, particularly in the Mediterranean region.[1] In 2010, EU Member States released 160 River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs), which contain plans for protecting and improving the water environment. The information in the RBMPs, together with other related sources of information, has been analysed to establish an assessment of the status of and pressures affecting Europe's waters. Over the last few years, European countries that are not EU Member States have developed similar river basin activities to those introduced by the Water Framework Directive.During 2015 EU Member States will finalise the second set of RBMPs. These will be the basis for an update of the status of Europe's waters and will illustrate progress in reducing pressures.  Key trends Overall, more than half of the river and lake water bodies in Europe are reported to hold less than good ecological status or potential (Map 1). Ecological status is a criterion for the quality of the structure and functioning of surface water ecosystems. River water bodies are reported to have worse ecological status and more pressures and impacts than lakes. The pressures reported to affect most surface water bodies are pollution from diffuse sources, in particular from agriculture, causing nutrient enrichment. Hydromorphological pressures also affect many surface water bodies, mainly from hydropower, navigation, agriculture, flood protection and urban development resulting in altered habitats. A large proportion of water bodies have poor ecological status and are affected by pollution pressures, particularly in central and north-western European areas with intensive agricultural practices and high population density. Map1: Proportion of classified river and lake water bodies in different River Basin Districts (RBD) holding less than good ecological status or potential  Source: WISE WFD Database. Many years of investment in the sewage system, and better wastewater treatment under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive together with national legislationhave led to some remarkable improvements. Europe's waters are much cleaner today than they were 25 years ago when large quantities of untreated or partially treated urban and industrial wastewater were discharged into water. Levels of oxygen-consuming substances (BOD5), ammonium, and phosphate decreased markedly in European rivers over the last two decades (Figure 1). Figure 1: Changes in water quality variables during the last two decades  Modern-day agricultural practices often entail the intensive use of fertilisers and manure, leading to high nutrient surpluses that are transferred to groundwater as well as surface water. About 25% of groundwater across Europe is classified as having poor chemical status, with nitrate being the primary cause. In European rivers, the nitrate concentration on average declined by 20% over the period 1992 to 2012 (Figure 1). This reflects the effect of measures to reduce agricultural inputs of nitrate at a European level (the Nitrates Directive) and at national level, as well as improvements in wastewater treatment. The Bathing Water Directive and the Drinking Water Directive have, together with national measures, resulted in good bathing water quality and clean drinking water in Europe. Some sites (e.g. bathing waters polluted during heavy rain or some shallow wells) still have to improve their performance. Hazardous substances in freshwaterresulting in poor chemical status can harm aquatic life and pose a risk tohuman health. The information provided in the RBMPs on chemical status is not sufficiently clear to establish a baseline for 2009. Hazardous substances are emitted to waters through a range of substances via many different pathways and from a variety of sources, includingindustry,agriculture,transport, mining and waste disposal, as well as from homes, where chemicals found in household products are discharged.Pesticidesused in agriculture have been widely detected in surface water and groundwater. Mining, landfill sites, and contaminated land from historical industrial and military activities all exert a localised but significantpressure upon waters in parts of Europe. If the morphology (structure) is degraded or the water flow (hydrology) is markedly changed, a water body with good water quality will not achieve its full potential as an ecosystem. For centuries humans have altered European surface waters (straightening and canalisation, disconnection of flood plains, land reclamations, dams, weirs, bank reinforcements, etc.) to facilitate agriculture and urbanisation and to produce energy and protect against flooding. There are several hundred thousand barriers and transverse structures in European rivers, and many water courses have had their seasonal or daily flow regimes changed. The WFD is the first piece of European environmental legislation that addresses hydromorphological modifications and their impacts on water bodies. The next RBMPs are obliged to include measures to reduce hydromorphological pressures if they cause less than good ecological status. Prospects The results from the first River Basin Management Plans showed that many European water bodies currently fail the WFD's objective of achieving good ecological and chemical status. In 2009, 43% of surface water bodies were in good or high ecological status, and in 2015, 53% of water bodies are expected to reach good ecological status.[2] This is far from meeting the objective of good ecological status and only constitutes a modest improvement in ecological status. To achieve good status, Member States will have to address the pressures affecting water bodies. Pollution is one pressure. Morphological changes, over-abstraction, and hydrological changes affecting water flow are others. While Member States are relatively clear about the types of pressures their river basins are encountering, precise information is missing on how these pressures will be addressed and to what extent the selected measures will contribute to the achievement of the environmental objectives in 2015. Full implementation of the WFD throughout all sectors is needed to reduce the different pressures and to commit all users in a river basin to focus on the achievement of healthy water bodies with good status. Although considerable success has been achieved in reducing the discharge of pollutants into Europe's waters in recent decades, challenges remain for urban and industrial wastewater and for pollution from agricultural sources. Wastewater treatment must continue to play a critical role in the protection of Europe's surface waters, and investment will be required to upgrade wastewater treatment and to maintain infrastructure in many European countries.

"tourism  Tourism  sustainable tourism environmental pressures impacts of tourism socio-economy       Context    Europe is the world's number one tourist destination. In 2013, France, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany were among the world's top 10 destinations for holidaymakers. [ 1 ] As a result, in 2010, this industry became a key sector of the European economy, generating over 10% of EU GDP.  [ 2 ]  Thus tourism also contributes to regional and potentially  sustainable development , while shaping a European identity and awareness onnatural and cultural heritage.    The European Union (EU) aims to promote tourism in order to maintain the region's position as a leading destination, and maximise the industry's contribution to growth and employment. [ 3 ]    The 2010 European Commission communication, 'Europe, the world's No 1 tourist destination a new political framework for tourism in Europe', is the most recent general policy reference and establishes main priority actions  for the sector. [ 4 ]     Figure 1: Components of the tourism system              The tourism industry is composed of many different sectors, including  transport  ,  agriculture  , and  energy  (Figure 1). Because of this, policy responses to the sustainability challenges   [ 5 ]   are fragmented across large areas of EU legislation.   [ 6 ]   A comprehensive policy reference specifically for tourism does not yet exist.      This policy fragmentation leads to problems of data availability for the sector as a whole, especially with regard to environmental impacts.    As a result, the European Commission encourages a coordinated approach for EU initiatives  [ 7 ]  in order to consolidate the whole knowledge base (such as through the European Tourism Indicators system) and to  increase sustainable growth (as recalled in the European Commission communication, 'A European Strategy for more Growth and Jobs in Coastal and Maritime Tourism').        Key trends    In recent decades, tourism within Europe has changed greatly in terms of seasonality, forms and frequency of trips. It has also changed in terms of demography and preferred destinations.  [ 8 ]  [ 9 ]    Peak periods have traditionally led to high environmental pressures especially in islands,coastal and mountain regions, while new trends are constantly emerging, with tourism taking place throughout the year, during the off-season, or in  some cities  that experience consistently high levels of visitors. This is due to globalised trends in culture and communication, an internetbased economy,and the increasing affordability of travel for ever-larger sections of the population. [ 10 ] Europe has also become the world's largest 'source region' of tourists taking trips elsewhere in the world.  [ 11 ][12]     Key trends in tourism volume (demand and supply) and intensity [ 13 ]  at country level   In 2012, within the EU-28, 51.3% of the population  [ 14 ]  made at least one trip of four overnight stays during the year as a tourist.     More than half (57.4%) of the nearly 545 000 accommodation establishments active in 2012 were concentrated in four EU Member States: Italy, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom.   In 2012, Spain was the most common tourism destination for non-residents, followed by Italy and France, which together accounted for 48.7% of the total nights; this needs to be seen in connection with the rapid growth in secondary homes (Box 1). As for tourism intensity  in 2012, the Mediterranean destinations of Malta, Cyprus and Croatia, as well as various destinations within Austria were the most popular. [ 15 ]      Key trends in tourism density demand and intensity across EU regions [ 16 ]          Tourism intensity within a certain destination shows the huge importance of tourism to many of the EU's coastal regions and, even more so, to its islands and most of the Alpine region. In the context of the sustainability of tourism, this relationship can also be seen as an indicator of potential tourism pressure in the 20 top regions [ 17 ]  that together accounted for 38.6% of the total overnight stays [ 18 ]  in 2011.   Also tourism density [ 19 ]  is particularly concentrated in coastal, mountain, and lake areas, where an increase in building and infrastructure has increased environmental pressure on protected and other natural and semi-natural territories.   Especially in the Mediterranean, tourism infrastructures and activities often have irreversible effects on natural areas rich in  biodiversity  and results in habitat deterioration for both terrestrial and aquatic plant and animal communities. [ 20 ]     Tourism impacts on environment and health     Despite the difficulties of quantifying the real impact of tourism on the environment, any increase in the number of tourists undoubtedly has an impact on environmental variables such as waste generation and energy consumption (in terms of volume and local level).       A tourist consumes 3 or 4 times more water per day than a permanent resident, with   non-tourist water use ranging between 100 and 200 litres per person per day across Europe  .  [ 21 ]   Necessary investments in the sewage system and wastewater treatment have taken place and have led to   Europe's bathing waters   being much cleaner today than they were 30 years ago. In 2013 more than 90% of bathing areas were judged as having good water quality.  [22]    In Torremolinos (Spain), electricity consumption (of which tourism accounts for about 40%) increased by 160% between 1989 and 2008, while several studies have reported increases in  municipal solid waste  (MSW) as the seasonal tourist population rises. This has particularly been the case in small islands which are environmentally more vulnerable to the MSW growth and where any negative effects on health may spread more quickly. [23]  In Menorca, during the period 1998 to 2010, the daily average of MSW generated in August by tourists is higher than that from residents, while a Maltese resident generates a daily average of 0.68 kg of MSW compared to a daily average 1.25 kg by a tourist in a hotel. [24]    Tourist transport by car causes the largest impacts on air quality [25]  whereas air transport accounts for the largest share of tourism-related  GHG emissions  (80% in 2000) in the EU-25. Rail, coaches and ferries account for almost 20% of all tourism trips, but are responsible for a very small percentage of environmental impacts. [26]  The most emission-intense [27]  mode of transport per kilometre travelled is cruise ship: direct air emissions of 0.330 kg CO 2 per ALB KM [28]  have been estimated. [29]  Furthermore, most cruises start with flights to reach harbours, adding between 10% and 30% to the total emissions caused by the cruise. [30]    The increasing speed and scale of global human movement [31]  has also enhanced opportunities for the  spread of disease . In 2011, Europe was the main source of importation for measles into the USA, while several mosquito-transmitted diseases [32]  have expanded their range and locally occurred in northern Italy in 2007 and southeast France in 2010. [33]    Response and prospects   Recent EU surveys [34]  show that the predominant factors in choosing holidays destinations continue to be the quality of natural features and landscape, especially in coastal areas. That confirms the importance of ' natural capital ' for the health of the tourism sector that  is becoming more environmentally conscious due to actions, some external, such as progressive policies, fiscal measures, and the highest number of 'green' certification schemes in the world (such as eco-labelling).  However, many of these certification schemes are still showing limited effectiveness in terms of cost savings or increased consumers demand. More coherence should be provided across them, while also improving consumer confidence.    By 2020 the car is still expected to account for the largest share of trips by tourists, while air travel will account for the largest share of kilometres travelled compared to today. Europe will also continue to lead the world in international arrivals, which are expected to increase from 57 per 100 of the population to 89 per 100 in 20102030. [35]  Globally, air passenger/km are expected to rise from 5 billion to more than 13 billion over the period 2010 to 2030, while intra-Europe travel is projected to remain among the world's top five travel patterns between 2030 and 2040. [36]      Box 1: Environmental impacts from second homes    Rapid growth of second homes during the 1990s increased pressure on the environment, especially in coastal and mountain zones. This caused  negative impacts such as land  uptake,  transportation to and from the homes, wildlife disruption, disposal of human waste and visual pollution. [37][38][39]      High densities of second homes can increase competition between their owners and locals for shared natural resources, resulting in huge pressures on infrastructures such as water supply, sewage, and roads. [40]      However, second homes made out of renovated rural stocks, instead of large scale tourism development,may also positively contribute to local communities.   [41]     In Europe many second homes are owned by people resident in other countries. For example, the breakdown of the location of second homes owned abroad by residents of the United Kingdom is 27% in Spain, 26% in France and 23% in the rest of Europe. [42]     Efforts exist to regulate construction of second homes. In Switzerland, with some exceptions, the construction of second homes is banned in areas where they already account for more than 20% of all homes. [43][44],Context Europe is the world's number one tourist destination.

"noise  Noise  health impacts environmental themes noise pollution     Context   Environmental noise can be defined as unwanted or harmful outdoor sound. It is a product of  transport  and  industrial activity  on land, in the air, on waterways, and on oceans. It is a pervasive pollutant that directly affects the  health  and well-being of exposed humans and wildlife. Tackling noise pollution is challenging its harmful impacts are clear, yet it occurs as a direct consequence of  society's demands for increased mobility and productivity.   Populations exposed to high noise levels can exhibit stress reactions, sleep-stage changes, and clinical symptoms like hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. All of these impacts can contribute to premature mortality. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports an onset of adverse health effects in humans exposed to noise levels at night above 40 decibels (dB). [ 1 ]    There is also increasing scientific evidence regarding the harmful effects of noise on wildlife. [ 2 ]  Whether in the terrestrial or  marine environment , many species rely on acoustic communication for important aspects of life, such as finding food or locating a mate.  Anthropogenic  noise sources can potentially interfere with these functions and thus adversely affect species richness, population size, and population distribution. In some instances, noise can be a cause of death, particularly in marine fauna. Underwater sound can travel great distances underwater, and its impacts may be felt far from the source of origin.   The Environmental Noise Directive (END), [ 3 ]  is the main European Union (EU) legal instrument through which land-based noise emissions are monitored and actions developed. It places an obligation on EU Member States to use common criteria for noise mapping (see Box 1). The END also obliges countries to develop and implement action plans to reduce exposure in large cities and places close to major transport infrastructure.    The END also requires Member States to select and preserve areas of good acoustic environmental quality, referred to as  'quiet areas'.  The EEA has recently published  guidance on protecting such areas  . The EEA has also published  guidance to assist countries on how to consider the latest health-impact evidence  in developing their action plans.      Box 1: Noise indicators in the Environmental Noise Directive   The END requires two main indicators to be applied in the assessment and management of environmental noise.     The first indicator (L den ) is the decibel level for day, evening, and night periods and is designed to measure 'annoyance'.The END defines an L den  threshold of 55 dB.   The second indicator (L night ) is the decibel level for night periods and is designed to assess sleep disturbance. An L night threshold of 50 dB is defined.     Since the implementation of the END, research has suggested that levels of 50 dB L den  may be more representative of annoyance, [ 4 ]  while for sleep disturbance the WHO has set a night noise guideline (NNG) for Europe of 40 dB L night . Where this is not achievable in the short term, the WHO recommends an interim target of 55 dB L night  (WHO 2009). [ 5 ]  Countries must report the numbers of people exposed above both thresholds for each noise source (e.g. roads, railways, airports, industry). The EEA uses these data to create an indicator for environmental noise in Europe. Countries are also invited to report to the EEA data corresponding to the WHO NNGs, although reporting of these data is voluntary.      Key trends    The  Noise Observation and Information Service for Europe  (NOISE) displays noise-mapping data reported by countries under the END to the EEA. Dataare available at European and national scale for most EEA member countries, including 472 urban agglomerations. Countries do not always report complete datasets information varies depending both upon the type of source concerned and the year of reporting (2007 or 2012). Overall, information is significantly less complete for the 2012 data, preventing any robust exposure or trend analysis.   Figure 1 shows exposure to environmental noise in Europe for 2011.  Road traffic  noise clearly contributes to the greatest level of exposure within the European population, with at least 125 million people being exposed to levels above the END threshold of 55 dB L den .   Figure 1: Exposure to environmental noise in Europe within* and outside urban agglomerations, 2011          In addition, many people were also exposed to rail, aircraft, and industrial noise, particularly in towns and cities.Similarly, night-time road traffic is another major source of noise exposure, with over 83 million Europeans exposed to harmful levels of noise greater than 50 dB L  night  .   [ 5 ]       The average exposure to noise (i.e. L  den  above 55 dB and L  night  above 50 dB) in selected urban agglomerations remained broadly constant between 2006 and 2011, according to comparable data reported by countries for these two years.    In  urban environments  it is evident from Figure 2 that a high percentage of the population in selectedcapital cities in Europe are exposed to detrimental levels of road-traffic noise according to data reported by countries. Exposure to the WHO interim target level of 55 dB L night  is also indicated in Figure 2.   Figure 2: Population exposed to night time noise from road traffic above 50dB in selected capital cities, 2011         Recent estimates of exposure to environmental noise indicate that it contributed to at least 900 000 additional prevalent cases of hypertension in 2011, 43 000 additional cases of hospital admissions and to 10 000 cases of premature mortality each year.  These numbers are likely to be significantly underestimated, potentially by more than a factor of two, due to the lack of complete data reported by countries. Almost 90% of the health impact caused by noise exposure is associated with road traffic noise.  [ 5 ]   In terms of economic impact, noise from road and rail traffic is estimated to cost the EU EUR 40 billion per year.  [ 6 ]    When the END requires a country to implement an action plan to reduce exposure to noise there are several measures a country can take. Examples of effective measures presently being undertaken in EEA member countries to reduce noise exposure include local measures such as the installation of road or rail-noise barriers, or optimising aircraft movements around airports. However, it is widely acknowledged that the most effective actions to reduce exposure tend to be those that reduce noise at source, e.g. by managing the numbers of road vehicles, or their noise emissions by e.g. introducing quieter road tyres.      Prospects   In the short term, the European Commission is expected to undertake a review of the implementation of the END by 2016. Beyond this, the 7th Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) [ 7 ]  'living  well, within the limits of our  planet', aims to ensure that by 2020 noise pollution in the EU has significantly decreased, moving closer to WHO-recommended levels.    There is a clear need to improve the Member States' implementation of the END, in particular with respect to the completeness, comparability and timeliness of reporting. The lack of complete datasets reported under the END may mean there will be a major challenge in the future to robustly evaluate whether the 7th EAP objective of significantly reducing noise pollution by 2020 has been met. Furthermore, i t will still be difficult to determine exactly how close Europe has moved toward meeting the WHO NNG for Europe (a level of 40 dB) in the future, as reporting of this information remains voluntary for countries.    To achieve the targets for reducing noise, the 7th EAP proposes to implement an updated noise policy, aligned with the latest scientific knowledge, as well as measures to reduce noise at source and improvements in city design.,Context Environmental noise can be defined as unwanted or harmful outdoor sound. It is a product of transport and industrial activity on land, in the air, on waterways, and on oceans. It is a pervasive pollutant that directly affects the health and well-being of exposed humans and wildlife. Tackling noise pollution is challenging its harmful impacts are clear, yet it occurs as a direct consequence of society'sdemands for increased mobility and productivity. Populations exposed to high noise levels can exhibit stress reactions, sleep-stage changes, and clinical symptoms like hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. All of these impacts can contribute to premature mortality. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports an onset of adverse health effects in humans exposed to noise levels at night above 40 decibels (dB).[1] There is also increasing scientific evidence regarding the harmful effects of noise on wildlife.[2] Whether in the terrestrial or marine environment, many species rely on acoustic communication for important aspects of life, such as finding food or locating a mate. Anthropogenic noise sources can potentially interfere with these functions and thus adversely affect species richness, population size, and population distribution. In some instances, noise can be a cause of death, particularly in marine fauna. Underwater sound can travel great distances underwater, and its impacts may be felt far from the source of origin. The Environmental Noise Directive (END),[3] is the main European Union (EU) legal instrument through which land-based noise emissions are monitored and actions developed. It places an obligation on EU Member States to use common criteria for noise mapping (see Box 1). The END also obliges countries to develop and implement action plans to reduce exposure in large cities and places close to major transport infrastructure. The END also requires Member States to select and preserve areas of good acoustic environmental quality, referred to as'quiet areas'.The EEA has recently publishedguidance on protecting such areas. The EEA has also publishedguidance to assist countries on how to consider the latest health-impact evidencein developing their action plans.  Box 1: Noise indicators in the Environmental Noise Directive The END requires two main indicators to be applied in the assessment and management of environmental noise.  The first indicator (Lden) is the decibel level for day, evening, and night periods and is designed to measure 'annoyance'.The END defines an Lden threshold of 55 dB. The second indicator (Lnight) is the decibel level for night periods and is designed to assess sleep disturbance. An Lnightthreshold of 50 dB is defined.  Since the implementation of the END, research has suggested that levels of 50 dB Lden may be more representative of annoyance,[4] while for sleep disturbance the WHO has set a night noise guideline (NNG) for Europe of 40 dB Lnight. Where this is not achievable in the short term, the WHO recommends an interim target of 55 dB Lnight (WHO 2009).[5] Countries must report the numbers of people exposed above both thresholds for each noise source (e.g. roads, railways, airports, industry). The EEA uses these data to create an indicator for environmental noise in Europe. Countries are also invited to report to the EEA data corresponding to the WHO NNGs, although reporting of these data is voluntary.  Key trends The Noise Observation and Information Service for Europe (NOISE) displays noise-mapping data reported by countries under the END to the EEA. Dataare available at European and national scale for most EEA member countries, including 472 urban agglomerations. Countries do not always report complete datasets information varies depending both upon the type of source concerned and the year of reporting (2007 or 2012). Overall, information is significantly less complete for the 2012 data, preventing any robust exposure or trend analysis. Figure 1 shows exposure to environmental noise in Europe for 2011. Road traffic noise clearly contributes to the greatest level of exposure within the European population, with at least 125 million people being exposed to levels above the END threshold of 55 dB Lden. Figure 1: Exposure to environmental noise in Europe within* and outside urban agglomerations, 2011  In addition, many people were also exposed to rail, aircraft, and industrial noise, particularly in towns and cities.Similarly, night-time road traffic is another major source of noise exposure, with over 83 million Europeans exposed to harmful levels of noise greater than 50 dB Lnight.[5] The average exposure to noise (i.e. Ldenabove 55 dB and Lnightabove 50 dB) in selected urban agglomerations remained broadly constant between 2006 and 2011, according to comparable data reported by countries for these two years. In urban environments it is evident from Figure 2 that a high percentage of the population in selectedcapital cities in Europe are exposed to detrimental levels of road-traffic noise according to data reported by countries. Exposure to the WHO interim target level of 55 dB Lnight is also indicated in Figure 2. Figure 2: Population exposed to night time noise from road traffic above 50dB in selected capital cities, 2011  Recent estimates of exposure to environmental noise indicate that it contributed to at least 900 000 additional prevalent cases of hypertension in 2011, 43 000 additional cases of hospital admissions and to 10 000 cases of premature mortality each year. These numbers are likely to be significantly underestimated, potentially by more than a factor of two, due to the lack of complete data reported by countries.Almost 90% of the health impact caused by noise exposure is associated with road traffic noise.[5] In terms of economic impact, noise from road and rail traffic is estimated to cost the EU EUR 40 billion per year.[6] When the END requires a country to implement an action plan to reduce exposure to noise there are several measures a country can take. Examples of effective measures presently being undertaken in EEA member countries to reduce noise exposure include local measures such as the installation of road or rail-noise barriers, or optimising aircraft movements around airports. However, it is widely acknowledged that the most effective actions to reduce exposure tend to be those that reduce noise at source, e.g. by managing the numbers of road vehicles, or their noise emissions by e.g. introducing quieter road tyres.  Prospects In the short term, the European Commission is expected to undertake a review of the implementation of the END by 2016. Beyond this, the 7th Environment Action Programme (7th EAP)[7]'living well, within the limits of our planet',aims to ensure that by 2020 noise pollution in the EU has significantly decreased, moving closer to WHO-recommended levels.

"biodiversity  Biodiversity  habitats biodiversity loss protected areas invasive alien species environmental themes        Context      Biodiversity, or biological diversity, is the variety of life and includes all living organisms found on Earth. It plays a key role in the functioning of ecosystems and the provision of  ecosystem services  which are essential for human life and well-being. These include provisioning services (e.g. fisheries,  biomass ), regulating and maintenance services (e.g. pollination, nutrient cycling, water purification) and cultural services (e.g. recreation). Yet despite  biodiversity's intrinsic value and its fundamental importance for humans, biodiversity is highly threatened by human activities and continues to be lost. This is estimated to reduce global GDP by 3% each year. [ 1 ]    In 2010 it was clear that neither the existing global nor the  European Union 's  (EU) 2010 biodiversity target  of reducing/halting biodiversity loss had been met, [ 2 ][ 3 ]  despite important progress in nature conservation measures in Europe, e.g. the expansion of the  Natura 2000 network  of  protected areas  and the recovery of some wildlife species (e.g. large carnivores). At the same time, key drivers of biodiversity loss remain or have increased, offsetting the positive actions to reverse this.   As a result, in 2010 world leaders adopted 20 targets   known as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets    for the period   20112020  with the aim to   'significantly  reduce the current rate of biodiversity   loss'.       In 2010, the EU set the ambitious overall target of '  Halting  the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services in the EU by 2020, and restoring them in so far as is feasible, while stepping up the EU contribution to averting global biodiversity   loss'.  In 2011, the European Council adopted its   EU  Biodiversity Strategy to   2020,  reinforced by the European Parliament Resolution in 2012 (see Box 1).      Box 1:The six targets covered by the  EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020      Fully implement the Birds and Habitats Directives;   Maintain and restore ecosystems and their services;   Increase the contribution of agriculture and forestry to maintaining and enhancing biodiversity;   Ensure the sustainable use of fisheries resources;   Combat invasive alien species (IAS); and   Help avert global biodiversity loss.         The Birds and Habitats Directives (known as the Nature Directives) aim to protect biodiversity and are the key pieces of legislation underpinning the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020. Other relevant EU legislation includes the  Water Framework Directive , the  Marine Strategy Framework Directive , the  Common Agricultural Policy  and the  Common Fisheries Policy .    In 2013 the European Commission adopted the Green Infrastructure Strategy.  [ 4 ]   In 2014 the European Council adopted a regulation on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of IAS.  [ 5 ]    Key trends   The key threats to biodiversity   The key threats to biodiversity   habitat change, pollution, over-exploitation, IAS, and climate change   continue to exert pressure causing loss of species and habitats and resulting in ecosystem degradation and weakening ecosystem resilience.   Habitat change     including loss, fragmentation and degradation     of natural and semi-natural habitats due to land-use change is a main pressure. For example, through fragmentation of the rural landscape because of   urban sprawl   and grey infrastructure developments; homogenisation and loss of habitat caused by   agricultural intensification   and land abandonment, and intensely managed   forests  .      Over-exploitation  of natural resources, in particular through   fisheries   in the   marine environment  , remains a large problem.       The accelerated establishment and spread of IAS     more than 12 000 alien species  [ 6 ]   now occur in Europe is not only   an important driver of biodiversity loss, but also causing considerable economic damage   to agriculture, forestry and fisheries worth billions of euros per year.  [ 7 ][ 8 ]  Europe faces an increasing trend of new IAS across all environments  .  [ 7 ]      Encouragingly, some pollution pressures have decreased such as the nutrient enrichment of European waters and the balance of nitrogen found on farmland. However, the level of nitrogen  still substantially exceeds ecosystem eutrophication limits in most of Europe and the eutrophication risk is predicted to remain in 2020 .      Increasing impacts from   climate change   are already affecting species'distribution, range and interaction and are projected to become a more significant threat in the coming decades. [ 9 ]  Climate change will also interact with and exacerbate other threats.      Status and trends of European biodiversity   Much is still unknown when it comes to the complete status and trends of European biodiversity and its relation to the functioning of  ecosystems  and the long-term delivery of services. Nonetheless, available information on selected species, habitats and ecosystems across Europe give cause for concern.    Information reported by EU Member States under the Birds and Habitats Directives indicates that local biodiversity loss could be considerable.  Under the   Habitats Directive,   the assessment for 20072012 shows that only 23% of animal and plant species assessments (Figure 1) and 16% of the habitat type assessments (Figure 2) were considered to be in a favourable conservation status.     A high proportion of species assessments(60%) and habitat assessments(77%) remain in unfavourable condition. The proportionof assessments of conservation status which are unknown has decreased (to 17% for species and 7% for habitats).         Data on population trends for various groups of species show both worrying and encouraging results. There has been a  dramatic decline in grassland butterflies  of almost 50% between 1990 and 2011 with no sign of recovery.   [ 10 ]     Europe's  common bird populations have declined by 12% since 1990 (common farmland birds have declined by 30%). Encouragingly, some  populations of European bats   [ 11 ]   and large carnivores   [ 12 ]   appear to have recovered to some extent from past declines, demonstrating positive results of conservation action and unplanned changes such as land abandonment.     Figure 1: Conservation status of species of European interest [ 13 ]         Figure 2: Conservation status of habitats of European interest [ 13 ]            Prospects   In Europe there has been progress on some issues. A significant achievement includes the expansion of the  Natura 2000  network of  protected areas  to 18% of EU land and 4% of EU marine waters. This means that the Aichi target for global coverage of protected areas by 2020 of at least 17% of the terrestrial and inland water areas has been met while much progress is still needed for meeting 10% of the coastal and marine areas. Conserving and managing the Natura 2000 network effectively, and enhancing their coherence through developing green infrastructure, such as wildlife corridors, is a critical step to protect Europe's biodiversity.   It will be very challenging for Europe to meet the overall target of halting the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of  ecosystem services  by 2020. Many of the direct, and all of the indirect influences on biodiversity loss, arise from a range of sectors and policies that exerts considerable pressure on biodiversity. These include  agriculture ,  fisheries , regional development and cohesion,  forestry ,  energy ,  tourism ,  transport  and  industry . Consequently, the fate of European biodiversity is also closely intertwined with the developments in these areas. Thus, the adequate integration of biodiversity considerations into certain economic sectors as well as regional policies remains critical in attempting to reduce the pressures on biodiversity. Successful mainstreaming of biodiversity into these areas   in both the public and private sectors   will be required.   The EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 [ 1 ]   if fully and effectively implemented   is foreseen as an important step towards halting the loss of biodiversity. For example, the effective integration of biodiversity concerns into sectors such as agriculture, forestry and fisheries (aim of targets 3 and 4) will be important in attempting to reduce the direct impacts on biodiversity. Another key step is the restoration of at least 15% of degraded ecosystems across Europe, the promotion of  green infrastructure in the EU  in urban and rural areas and ensuring no net loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services (target 2). All of which have the potential to considerably benefit biodiversity, as well as society, through strengthening the coherence of the Natura 2000 network, increasing  ecosystem resilience  and providing nature-based solutions to  climate change adaptation . Target 2 also aims to improve the knowledge base on ecosystems and their services in the EU [ 14 ] in order to assess the economic value of ecosystem services and to promote the integration of these values into accounting and reporting systems at EU and national level by 2020.    In  today's increasingly globalised economy, international trade chains accelerate habitat degradation far away from the place of consumption. [ 15 ] Given that Europe has a high ecological footprint and relies heavily on the import of resources and goods from all over the world,  Europe's impact on biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation extends well beyond its borders. Consequently, European efforts to halt biodiversity loss on its continent should ensure that pressures are not transferred to other parts of the world thereby exacerbating global biodiversity loss.,Context Biodiversity, or biological diversity, is the variety of life and includes all living organisms found on Earth. It plays a key role in the functioning of ecosystems and the provision of ecosystem services which are essential for human life and well-being. These include provisioning services (e.g. fisheries, biomass), regulating and maintenance services (e.g. pollination, nutrient cycling, water purification) and cultural services (e.g. recreation). Yet despite biodiversity'sintrinsic value and its fundamental importance for humans, biodiversity is highly threatened by human activities and continues to be lost. This is estimated to reduce global GDP by 3% each year.[1] In 2010 it was clear that neither the existing global nor the European Union's (EU) 2010 biodiversity target of reducing/halting biodiversity loss had been met,[2][3] despite important progress in nature conservation measures in Europe, e.g. the expansion of the Natura 2000 network of protected areas and the recovery of some wildlife species (e.g. large carnivores). At the same time, key drivers of biodiversity loss remain or have increased, offsetting the positive actions to reverse this. As a result, in 2010 world leaders adopted 20 targetsknown as the Aichi Biodiversity Targetsfor the period 20112020with the aim to 'significantlyreduce the current rate of biodiversity loss'. In 2010, the EU set the ambitious overall target of 'Haltingthe loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services in the EU by 2020, and restoring them in so far as is feasible, while stepping up the EU contribution to averting global biodiversity loss'.In 2011, the European Council adopted its EUBiodiversity Strategy to 2020,reinforced by the European Parliament Resolution in 2012 (see Box 1).  Box 1:The six targets covered by the EUBiodiversity Strategy to2020  Fully implement the Birds and Habitats Directives; Maintain and restore ecosystems and their services; Increase the contribution of agriculture and forestry to maintaining and enhancing biodiversity; Ensure the sustainable use of fisheries resources; Combat invasive alien species (IAS); and Help avert global biodiversity loss.   The Birds and Habitats Directives (known as the Nature Directives) aim to protect biodiversity and are the key pieces of legislation underpinning the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020. Other relevant EU legislation includes the Water Framework Directive, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy. In 2013 the European Commission adopted the Green Infrastructure Strategy.[4] In 2014 the European Council adopted a regulation on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of IAS.[5] Key trends The key threats to biodiversity The key threats to biodiversity habitat change, pollution, over-exploitation, IAS, and climate change continue to exert pressure causing loss of species and habitats and resulting in ecosystem degradation and weakening ecosystem resilience. Habitat changeincluding loss, fragmentation and degradation of natural and semi-natural habitats due to land-use change is a main pressure. For example, through fragmentation of the rural landscape because of urban sprawl and grey infrastructure developments; homogenisation and loss of habitat caused by agricultural intensification and land abandonment, and intensely managed forests. Over-exploitation of natural resources, in particular through fisheries in the marine environment, remains a large problem. The accelerated establishment and spread ofIASmore than 12 000 alien species[6] now occur in Europe is not only an important driver of biodiversity loss, but also causing considerable economic damage to agriculture, forestry and fisheries worth billions of euros per year.[7][8]Europe faces an increasing trend of new IAS across all environments.[7] Encouragingly, some pollution pressures have decreased such as the nutrient enrichment of European waters and the balance of nitrogen found on farmland. However, the level of nitrogen still substantially exceeds ecosystem eutrophication limits in most of Europe and the eutrophication risk is predicted to remain in 2020. Increasing impacts from climate change are already affecting species'distribution, range and interaction and are projected to become a more significant threat in the coming decades.[9] Climate change will also interact with and exacerbate other threats.  Status and trends of European biodiversity Much is still unknown when it comes to the complete status and trends of European biodiversity and its relation to the functioning of ecosystems and the long-term delivery of services. Nonetheless, available information on selected species, habitats and ecosystems across Europe give cause for concern. Information reported by EU Member States under the Birds and Habitats Directives indicates that local biodiversity loss could be considerable.Under the Habitats Directive, the assessment for 20072012 shows that only 23% of animal and plant species assessments (Figure 1) and 16% of the habitat type assessments (Figure 2) were considered to be in a favourable conservation status. A high proportion of species assessments(60%) and habitat assessments(77%) remain in unfavourable condition. The proportionof assessments of conservation status which are unknown has decreased (to 17% for species and 7% for habitats).  Data on population trends for various groups of species show both worrying and encouraging results. There has been adramatic decline in grassland butterfliesof almost 50% between 1990 and 2011 with no sign of recovery.[10]Europe'scommon bird populations have declined by 12% since 1990 (common farmland birds have declined by 30%). Encouragingly, somepopulations of European bats[11]and large carnivores[12]appear to have recovered to some extent from past declines, demonstrating positive results of conservation action and unplanned changes such as land abandonment. Figure 1: Conservation status of species of European interest[13]  Figure 2: Conservation status of habitats of European interest[13]   Prospects In Europe there has been progress on some issues. A significant achievement includes the expansion of the Natura 2000 network of protected areas to 18% of EU land and 4% of EU marine waters. This means that the Aichi target for global coverage of protected areas by 2020 of at least 17% of the terrestrial and inland water areas has been met while much progress is still needed for meeting 10% of the coastal and marine areas. Conserving and managing the Natura 2000 network effectively, and enhancing their coherence through developing green infrastructure, such as wildlife corridors, is a critical step to protect Europe's biodiversity. It will be very challenging for Europe to meet the overall target of halting the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services by 2020. Many of the direct, and all of the indirect influences on biodiversity loss, arise from a range of sectors and policies that exerts considerable pressure on biodiversity. These include agriculture, fisheries, regional development and cohesion, forestry, energy, tourism, transport and industry. Consequently, the fate of European biodiversity is also closely intertwined with the developments in these areas. Thus, the adequate integration of biodiversity considerations into certain economic sectors as well as regional policies remains critical in attempting to reduce the pressures on biodiversity. Successful mainstreaming of biodiversity into these areas in both the public and private sectors will be required. The EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020[1]if fully and effectively implemented is foreseen as an important step towards halting the loss of biodiversity. For example, the effective integration of biodiversity concerns into sectors such as agriculture, forestry and fisheries (aim of targets 3 and 4) will be important in attempting to reduce the direct impacts on biodiversity. Another key step is the restoration of at least 15% of degraded ecosystems across Europe, the promotion of green infrastructure in the EU in urban and rural areas and ensuring no net loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services (target 2). All of which have the potential to considerably benefit biodiversity, as well as society, through strengthening the coherence of the Natura 2000 network, increasing ecosystem resilience and providing nature-based solutions to climate change adaptation. Target 2 also aims to improve the knowledge base on ecosystems and their services in the EU[14]in order to assess the economic value of ecosystem services and to promote the integration of these values into accounting and reporting systems at EU and national level by 2020. In today'sincreasingly globalised economy, international trade chains accelerate habitat degradation far away from the place of consumption.[15]Given that Europe has a high ecological footprint and relies heavily on the import of resources and goods from all over the world, Europe'simpact on biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation extends well beyond its borders. Consequently, European efforts to halt biodiversity loss on its continent should ensure that pressures are not transferred to other parts of the world thereby exacerbating global biodiversity loss. "
"mitigating-climate-change  Mitigating climate change  climate change mitigation emission reduction greenhouse gas emissions environmental themes air emissions        Context    In 1992, countries adopted the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to cooperatively consider options for limiting  average global temperature increases and the resulting climate change .  [ 1 ]  Continuous discussions under the UNFCCC led to the adoption in 1997 of the  Kyoto Protocol , [ 2 ] which legally binds developed countries to achieving  greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets.   In 2010, the international community agreed on the need to reduce emissions in order to prevent global temperature increases from exceeding 2 C compared to pre-industrial levels [ 3 ]  (no more than 1.2 C above today's level). This would require cutting global emissions by 40% to 70% compared to 2010 by 2050. [ 4 ]    More than 90 countries agreed to take on mitigation commitments until 2020 including the major developed and developing nations. The European Union (EU) and a handful of other developed countries made their commitments under the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol for a second commitment period running from 2013 to 2020. [ 5 ]      The pledges up to 2020 are insufficient to ensure the global temperature rise stays below 2 C but they don't preclude meeting this objective. [ 4 ][ 6 ] To secure the chances to stay below 2 C, the international community has decided to work towards an international climate agreement for the period after 2020, which should be applicable to all. The negotiation on this new global agreement is expected to be concluded in 2015 in Paris.   In this context of international efforts to limit  climate change , the EU is committed to cutting its emissions by 2020 by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels. It has offered to increase the reduction to 30% below 1990 levels, subject to other countries offering similar efforts towards 2020. [ 7 ][ 8 ]    These commitments have been backed by concrete policies and measures to reduce GHG emissions in Europe. The EU implemented  an  Emissions Trading System   (ETS) for industrial installations in power generation and manufacturing in 2005 [ 9 ][ 10 ]  and strengthened it in 2009 to help the EU achieve its 2020 objectives. [ 11 ] Since 2012, the EU ETS also includes aviation. [ 12 ] The EU ETS today covers about 45% of EU emissions. In parallel, annual targets have been set for each Member State to reduce emissions in the sectors not covered by the EU ETS. [ 13 ] Binding targets are now in place to reduce CO 2  emissions from new cars and vans. [ 14 ][ 15 ] Further efforts also include the promotion of renewable sources of energy, [ 16 ][ 17 ] measures to improve the efficiency of energy supply and use, [ 18 ][ 19 ] the regulation of F-gases, [ 20 ] etc.   The EU has also articulated a long-term goal for 2050 of reducing Europe's GHG emissions by 80% to 95% compared to 1990 levels. [ 21 ][22][23] To ensure that the EU is on a cost-effective track towards meeting this objective, the European Council adoptedin 2014 a new set of climate and energy targets for2030 . [ 24 ] [ 25 ]  This includes a bindingtarget of reducing emissions by at least40% compared to1990 levels, a target, binding at EU level,of achieving a share of at least 27% for  renewable energy  consumption, and an indicative target at EU level of at least 27% for improving energy efficiency, compared to projections of future energy consumption.   Key trends   The EU has been reducing its own GHG emissions and its share of global GHGs. The EU has already almost reached its unilateral 20% reduction target, eight years ahead of 2020. Between 1990 and 2012, total GHG emissions in the EU decreased by 18% [ 26 ][ 27 ]  (Figure 1). During this period, the EU's share of global GHG emissions declined from 13% to 10%. [ 28 ] In this same period, average per-capita emissions decreased by a quarter, from 11.7 to 9.0 tonnes of CO 2  equivalent per capita. [ 28 ]  The GHG emissions intensity of the EU economy improved substantially  , with a 44% decrease of emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP).  [ 28 ][ 29 ]    Figure 1: Greenhouse gas emission trends, projections and targets         Almost all of the European countries with an individual GHG reduction or limitation target under the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period (20082012) are on track towards achieving their respective targets. [ 30 ] Besides the additional contribution in most countries of activities enhancing carbon sinks (such as forestry) the use of  Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms  (the purchase of emission reduction credits from other countries) will help ten European countries (including seven Member States) [ 31 ]  reach their individual target.   During the period from 1990 to 2012, GHG emissions in Europe decreased in the majority of sectors, with the notable exception of transport (Figure 2). The largest absolute reductions were in the emissions from energy use in industrial, residential, and commercial sectors (energy-related emissions represent about 80% of EU GHG emissions). However, significant reductions in relative terms took place in other sectors, such as  agriculture  and  waste management . The largest reductions, which took place in industrial sectors, can be explained by efficiency improvements in restructured iron and steel plants, a reduced reliance on highly-emitting fuels such as coal, and structural changes of the economy toward a higher share of services and a lower share of industry in total GDP. [ 28 ]    Figure 2: Greenhouse gases sectoral trends and projections 'with existing measures'         Although GHG emissions trends in the EU were considerably affected by economic or macroeconomic factors during the period from 1990 to 2012,   EU and national policies have been playing an increasing role in these decreasing trends  .      The economic crisis that the EU encountered during the 20082012 period is estimated to have contributed to less than half of the total emission reduction observed during this period.  The combined effects of other factors and policies have played at least as important a role in GHG emission reductions as the economic crisis. A significant share of emission reductions during this period was due to climate and energy policies, in particular the increase of renewables in the EU energy mix and the improvement in   energy efficiency   of the economy.  [ 28 ]    Prospects   Aggregated projections from Member States indicate that total EU GHG emissions will further decrease. With the set of national domestic measures in place by mid-2012, EU emissions are expected to reach a level of 21% below 1990 levels by 2020 [ 26 ][ 32 ] and only 22% below 1990 levels by 2030. Implementing the additional measures that were at planning stage in Member States by mid-2012 could help achieve reductions of 24% by 2020 and 28% by 2030 compared to 1990. The EU reference scenario used in the Commission's impact assessment of the 2030 climate and energy policy framework [ 33 ] indicates that with current legislation agreed in the EU, total GHG emissions in the EU might be 32% lower in 2030 compared to 1990.       The largest emission reductions in the EU by 2020 are projected to take place in the sectors covered by the  EU ETS , where emissions are capped at EU level. Large reductions are expected to come from already-adopted measures supporting renewable energy [ 20 ]   or aiming at   limiting and reducing pollution from large combustion plants .  [ 34 ]   When it comes to non-ETS emissions, most Member States expect that their national targets for the period from 2013 to 2020 will be met through policies or measures already in place. [ 32 ]   However, in about half of the Member States [ 35 ]   additional measures will need to be implemented to achieve the targets. In particular, key contributions are expected from energy-efficiency measures targeting the buildings sector.      Full implementation of existing policy instruments is a necessary first step towards further emission reductions in all Member States. However, t   he anticipated reductions by 2030 remain insufficient compared to the 40% reduction target and the even steeper reduction needed beyond 2030, in order for the EU to remain on a trajectory towards a low-carbon and resource-efficient economy. To achieve the 40% reduction target by 2030 compared to 1990 levels,  the ETS sector will have to reduce its emissions by 43% and the non-ETS sector by 30%, compared to 2005, respectively.   [ 24 ]      In the  EU ETS , further reductions will be driven through strengthened emission caps. Outside the ETS, new policies and measures remain necessary to address emissions in sectors for which projected trends remain problematic, in particular in the transport sector.      Fulfilling Europe's long-term objectives could be achieved through fundamental changes in our energy and transport systems, in particular by further improving their efficiency and by ensuring coherent planning and infrastructure on various governance levels.  However, becoming more   resource efficient  will not be sufficient on its own to achieve Europe's long-term objectives,  for example  if the volume of transport continues to grow or if we keep increasing the number of domestic appliances. After all, we could become more efficient but still put excessive demands on the environment. For that reason, in order to achieve sustainability we also need to focus on the limits of   natural systems  .,Context In 1992, countries adopted the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to cooperatively consider options for limiting average global temperature increases and the resulting climate change.[1]Continuous discussions under the UNFCCC led to the adoption in 1997 of the Kyoto Protocol,[2]which legally binds developed countries to achieving greenhouse gas(GHG) emission reduction targets.

"hungary  Hungary  country briefings    Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report    Considering international requirements  [1]  [2] , the annual report on the state of the environment (SoER) is stipulated byAct LIII of 1995  [3] . The SoER [4]  is compiled by the government body responsible for the environmental protection (as of 2013 the Ministry of Rural Development, in co-operation with the National Institute for Environment) and aims to inform the Government and the general public.   The latest report, published in 2013, deals with environmental topics such as climate change, diversity of nature, waste management, environmental pollution in connection with health and quality of life, environmental management issues, environmental challenges for Hungary and Europe. The report uses roughly 100 indicators arranged by the EEA's  DPSIR  (driving forcespressuresstateimpactresponses) model.   Complementing the SoER, the Hungarian Central Statistical Office publishes environmental snapshots [5]  bi-annually and regularly updates national environmental statistics [6]  on the internet.    Key findings of the State of Environment report    There has been a decrease ingreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from economic activities (since the late 1990s) and from households (since 2006). In 2011, 82% of GHG emissions came directly from economic activity. From 2000 to 2011, N 2 O emissions from the economy decreased by 22%, CH 4  emissions by 17%. Meanwhile CO 2  emissions increased until 2005 then started to decrease. An increase in HFC emissions has almost stopped in part because they are replaced by other gas mixtures.   Some of the air pollutants from national economy are still causing environmental problems. Emissions of acidifying substances have drastically decreased from 2000 to 2011 (by 65%) primarily due to the use of SO 2  abatement methods. Ammonia and nitrogen-oxide emissions have become the most significant factors of acidification. NO X  concentrations have exceeded health limit values several times over in certain areas.   Emissions of ozone precursors decreased from 2000 to 2011 (by 31%); PM 10  emissions halved while PM 2.5  fell by one third in the same period. However, the total quantity of atmospheric particulate matter is still problematic. Health limit values are often exceeded because the dominant part of total emissions comes from households especially during the winter season and from the effect of long-range transport (PM 10 : 56%, PM 2.5 : 77%).   The state of soil, which is a significant natural resource in Hungary, is good but land used for agriculture is endangered by numerous physical and chemical degradation processes (e.g. erosion, acidification) caused by inadequate land and fertilizer utilization. As the general state of natural areas is a serious issue worldwide, the loss of biodiversityalso presents a major challenge to Hungary. Biodiversity is considered to be good or over average in some respects but this benefit seems to disappear gradually, e.g. farmland birds' population decreased by about 24% (20072012).   Nine per cent of surface water courses and 65% of lakes and reservoirs are in good or excellent ecological status (2010). Since 94% of surface water supply comes from neighbouring countries, it is heavily dependent on external factors, both in quantity and quality. Annual public utility water consumption per capita has gradually decreased since 2000 (by 10%) due to high water price and waste water discharge fee, and, in response, the water supply of private wells. Although the quality of most potable water supplied is good the quality of 30% of public potable water supply does not fill EU requirements. This concerns the high concentration of geologically originated arsenic, ammonia, iron and manganese. In 2012, 74% of households were supplied by via the public sewerage system, and 97.8% of sewage water was cleaned (46.9% of the total was biologically cleaned, which has been increasing).   Total waste generation has slowly been dwindling. In 2007 and 2008, waste generation fell back drastically. In 2010, simultaneously with slight GDP growth, the quantity of waste generated showed a more moderate decrease. The total quantity of waste (2011) still did not reach half the waste generated in 2000. Recycling rate of several waste streams (e.g. municipal solid waste) has increased since 2005. Waste incineration decreased significantly between 2000 and 2005 and has been unchanged ever since. The quantity of deposited municipal solid waste has been decreasing.     Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns     The National Environment Programme (NEP) [7][8]  sets the environmental policy aims and provides the necessary measures, and is complemented by several thematic strategies.   Transportation and energy are decisive factors in shaping the state of the atmospheric environment, among others. Funding schemes, legislative changes and pertaining strategies primarily target energy-efficiency (especially for buildings), and increased use of renewable energy. The use of public transport is decreasing, while the rate of private transport is increasing. Funding has been provided for environmentally friendly transport solutions (e.g. public transport, especially city road transport and intercity rail transport, bicycle routes), but there is still room for further improvements.   57 per cent of Hungary's territory is made up ofagricultural land. National and EU funds have been facilitating agri-environmental measures, however, in 2011, the share of land being used for organic farming (2.2%) is less than half the EU-27 average (5.4%) [9] . For the preservation of biodiversity, the NEP ensures priority to the interest of nature in urbanization, infrastructure development and agriculture, and contains active nature conservation measures (e.g. protection of species, remediation of habitats).   The protection of water resources is also a principle objective. Improving waste water treatment, modernizing landfills,implementing the nitrate action programme and the new Act CCIX of 2011 [10]  all contribute to a reduction in adverse effects on waters and the realization of sustainable water management. Basic elements of the Act are principles of protection of natural resources and of recovery of costs, and the 'polluter-pays' principle. The continued improvement of natural water retention, and reservation technologies also play an important role in climate change adaptation. Further hydro-morphological measures are to be made to expand the good ecological status of surface waters.   While there has been a considerable degree of technological development within the economy, the principles of circular economy are not yet widespread. The NEP [8]  puts emphasis on further improving resource efficiency, strengthening green economy and enhancing eco-innovation. The renewed waste management regulatory system highlights waste prevention, reuse and recycling.      Country specific issues   The Accessible Sky agreement was signed on 26 February 2008 in collaboration with all distribution companies, governmental and non-governmental conservation organisations to minimise bird mortality along power lines. Numerous large-scale projects have been launched since the agreement was signed. [11]    Thanks to improving co-operation, energy companies have also co-financed projects right from the beginning. Since 2011, for the relevant projects, a minimum of 25% co-financing by energy companies is a requirement under the Hungarian Environment and Energy Operational Programme. Under the agreement, Birdlife Hungary produced a conflict map to prioritise all power lines in Hungary. The total length of top priority power lines was 21 700 km for retrofitting.   Large-scale projects included the burial of 80 km and 11 km of medium-voltage power lines in the Hortobgy National Park and in the Borsodi Mezsg Landscape Protection Area, respectively. Bird diverters were fitted on 45 km of medium and high voltage power lines in some of the most important Great Bustard sites in Hungary to avoid collision. Two LIFE Nature projects focused on prevention of electrocution: a total of 910 km of medium voltage power lines were insulated to saveSaker Falcons and Red-footed Falcons, primarily. In close cooperation of energy companies and conservation experts, the best available technology (BAT) to produce power lines in a bird friendly way is constantly updated and new solutions are field-tested. In addition, the cooperating partners also support the nesting of Saker Falcons with nestboxes mounted on pylons (Fig 1).

They draw attention to this growing, but not well-known ecological problem: the sensitivity of wildlife to artificial light at night. In Hungary, there are two certified International Dark Sky Parks. The Starry Sky Park at the Zselic [12]  Landscape Protection Area became the first certified dark sky park in Europe together with the Scotch Galloway Forest Park in 2009. The second certified area is the Hortobgy [13]  Starry Sky Park that is located in the heart of the Hortobgy National Park. It earned the International Dark Sky Park title in 2011.,Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report Considering international requirements [1][2], the annual report on the state of the environment (SoER) is stipulated byAct LIII of 1995 [3]. The SoER[4] is compiled by the government body responsible for the environmental protection (as of 2013 the Ministry of Rural Development, in co-operation with the National Institute for Environment) and aims to inform the Government and the general public. The latest report, published in 2013, deals with environmental topics such as climate change, diversity of nature, waste management, environmental pollution in connection with health and quality of life, environmental management issues, environmental challenges for Hungary and Europe. The report uses roughly 100 indicators arranged by the EEA's DPSIR (driving forcespressuresstateimpactresponses) model. Complementing the SoER, the Hungarian Central Statistical Office publishes environmental snapshots[5] bi-annually and regularly updates national environmental statistics[6] on the internet. Key findings of the State of Environment report There has been a decrease ingreenhouse gas(GHG)emissions from economic activities (since the late 1990s) and from households (since 2006). In 2011, 82% of GHG emissions came directly from economic activity. From 2000 to 2011, N2O emissions from the economy decreased by 22%, CH4 emissions by 17%. Meanwhile CO2 emissions increased until 2005 then started to decrease. An increase in HFC emissions has almost stopped in part because they are replaced by other gas mixtures. Some of the air pollutants from national economy are still causing environmental problems. Emissions of acidifying substances have drastically decreased from 2000 to 2011 (by 65%) primarily due to the use of SO2 abatement methods. Ammonia and nitrogen-oxide emissions have become the most significant factors of acidification. NOX concentrations have exceeded health limit values several times over in certain areas. Emissions of ozone precursors decreased from 2000 to 2011 (by 31%); PM10 emissions halved while PM2.5 fell by one third in the same period. However, the total quantity of atmospheric particulate matter is still problematic. Health limit values are often exceeded because the dominant part of total emissions comes from households especially during the winter season and from the effect of long-range transport (PM10: 56%, PM2.5: 77%). The state of soil, which is a significant natural resource in Hungary, is good but land used for agriculture is endangered by numerous physical and chemical degradation processes (e.g. erosion, acidification) caused by inadequate land and fertilizer utilization. As the general state of natural areas is a serious issue worldwide, the loss of biodiversityalso presents a major challenge to Hungary. Biodiversity is considered to be good or over average in some respects but this benefit seems to disappear gradually, e.g. farmland birds' population decreased by about 24% (20072012). Nine per cent of surface water courses and 65% of lakes and reservoirs are in good or excellent ecological status (2010). Since 94% of surface water supply comes from neighbouring countries, it is heavily dependent on external factors, both in quantity and quality. Annual public utility water consumption per capita has gradually decreased since 2000 (by 10%) due to high water price and waste water discharge fee, and, in response, the water supply of private wells. Although the quality of most potable water supplied is good the quality of 30% of public potable water supply does not fill EU requirements. This concerns the high concentration of geologically originated arsenic, ammonia, iron and manganese. In 2012, 74% of households were supplied by via the public sewerage system, and 97.8% of sewage water was cleaned (46.9% of the total was biologically cleaned, which has been increasing). Total waste generation has slowly been dwindling. In 2007 and 2008, waste generation fell back drastically. In 2010, simultaneously with slight GDP growth, the quantity of waste generated showed a more moderate decrease. The total quantity of waste (2011) still did not reach half the waste generated in 2000. Recycling rate of several waste streams (e.g. municipal solid waste) has increased since 2005. Waste incineration decreased significantly between 2000 and 2005 and has been unchanged ever since. The quantity of deposited municipal solid waste has been decreasing.  Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns  The National Environment Programme (NEP)[7][8] sets the environmental policy aims and provides the necessary measures, and is complemented by several thematic strategies. Transportation and energy are decisive factors in shaping the state of the atmospheric environment, among others. Funding schemes, legislative changes and pertaining strategies primarily target energy-efficiency (especially for buildings), and increased use of renewable energy. The use of public transport is decreasing, while the rate of private transport is increasing. Funding has been provided for environmentally friendly transport solutions (e.g. public transport, especially city road transport and intercity rail transport, bicycle routes), but there is still room for further improvements. 57 per cent of Hungary's territory is made up ofagricultural land. National and EU funds have been facilitating agri-environmental measures, however, in 2011, the share of land being used for organic farming (2.2%) is less than half the EU-27 average (5.4%)[9]. For the preservation of biodiversity, the NEP ensures priority to the interest of nature in urbanization, infrastructure development and agriculture, and contains active nature conservation measures (e.g. protection of species, remediation of habitats). The protection of water resources is also a principle objective. Improving waste water treatment, modernizing landfills,implementing the nitrate action programme and the new Act CCIX of 2011[10] all contribute to a reduction in adverse effects on waters and the realization of sustainable water management. Basic elements of the Act are principles of protection of natural resources and of recovery of costs, and the 'polluter-pays' principle. The continued improvement of natural water retention, and reservation technologies also play an important role in climate change adaptation. Further hydro-morphological measures are to be made to expand the good ecological status of surface waters. While there has been a considerable degree of technological development within the economy, the principles of circular economy are not yet widespread. The NEP[8] puts emphasis on further improving resource efficiency, strengthening green economy and enhancing eco-innovation.

"liechtenstein  Liechtenstein  country briefings    Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report    Liechtenstein first compiled an environmental report in 2004. Since 2010 the regular environmental statistics have been published. [1]  The legal provisions for the environmental statistics are contained within the Statistics Act. [2]    The statistics aim to illustrate the condition and development of Liechtenstein's environment as well as to provide comparative data to other countries.   These statistics contains tables, partially dated back to the seventies, and extensive maps for visualizing tables and indicators. Templates for those indicators came from the environmental indicators of the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) and the Swiss Federal Statistics Office (FSO), and indicators for sustainable development of the Statistical Office of Liechtenstein. The Environmental Statistics consists of three parts.      The first part presents the results of new environmental statistics and compares these with previous years as well as other countries.     In the second part, detailed data tables and maps as well as indicators are listed.       The third part describes the methodology used in the environment statistics.        The following environmental issues are analysed:        air,     climate,     water,     soil,     landscape,     biodiversity,     forests,     waste,     noise, and     environmental levies.       Key findings of the State of Environment report    Liechtenstein selected and described five important environmental topics as key findings: particulate matter air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), forest habitats, waste and traffic noise. As those issues are up for discussion on a regular basis in the environment sector those key findings were selected as they are recurrently debated in Liechtenstein.      Particulate matter air pollution decreases (PM 10 )    Particulate matter pollution has been reduced in 2012 compared to the previous year. Nitrogen pollution was also lower in 2012 than in 2011. However, the limit values at various locations were regularly exceeded. The ozone concentration exceeded the limit in 2012, despite a decline compared to the previous year.   Greenhouse gas emissions are above the target value   In 2012, 225 400 tonnes of CO 2  equivalents were emitted. Thus, GHG emissions exceed the amount, stipulated in the Kyoto Protocol target for the period 2008 to 2012, of average 25 248 t per year. 2011 was the first time the greenhouse gas emissions were below the 1990 reference values (228 100 t).   Figure 1: Total greenhouse gas emissions within the first commitment period        Source:  Liechtenstein's National Inventory Report 2014  Note: The red line represents the Kyoto target (-8 % of 1990 emissions)    Forest habitat quality increases   The forest habitat value is an ecological index for the quality of the forest as a habitat for animals and plants. In 2010, according to the forest inventory of Liechtenstein, 35.3 % of the forests exhibited a high habitat value. Thus, the share has increased by 24.2 % in the last 12 years. In 1998, 11.1 % of the forests were classified with a high habitat value.   Municipal waste slightly decreases   In 2012 about 28 200 t of municipal waste were generated. Compared to 2011 the municipal waste decreased by 200 tonnes. The recycling rate was 64.6 % in 2012. Hence, it has risen slightly compared to2011 when it was at 64.1 %.      13 % of the general public is affected by road traffic noise daily   In 2010 4 741 persons were burdened by traffic noise of 60 dB (A) or more. This corresponds to 13.1 % of the population. At night 3 587 persons or 9.9 % of the population were exposed to traffic noise of 50 dB (A) or more. The noise exposure is thus significantly reduced during the night compared to the day. [3]      Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns     Liechtenstein, as a member of the Convention on Biodiversity, aims to strengthen the protection and sustainability of biodiversity. For sectors with biodiversity many concepts and approaches already exist. Examples include nature and landscape protection for Liechtenstein forests; the development of nature and agriculture; as well as regional cooperation such as in the Alpenrhein area.   In the current revision of the Water Protection Ordinance the space occupied by water in Liechtenstein is defined. Defining this 'water space' allows for sustainable and spatial planning backup to take place as regards flood protection and the maintenance of ecological integrity. The use of this space by agriculture is limited by law as well as any structural use.   For the water space calculation the dimension of the natural channel width of a waterbody, if enabled to flow freely under natural conditions, serves as the basic input.   A water body in ecologically valuable areas or used for agriculture is allocated even more space using an additional biodiversity curve.   In addition to preserving a self-cleaning capacity, the linking of habitats and a reduction in nutrient input, conservation of specific areas also has priority.   Protecting water bodies for future generations against buildings and fixed construction is an important part of the riverine zone policies.   Liechtenstein has integrated its climate policy very strongly into individual sectorial policies. The focus is on energy, environmental, transport, agricultural and forestry policies. All of these areas encompass measures that contribute to the reduction of climate gases. In order to ensure a coordinated implementation of climate policies within the various areas, the government passed a Climate Protection Strategy in 2007. The Strategy requires an interdisciplinary coordination in the fields of environment, energy, building, transportation, agriculture and forestry with respect to the development of climate policy measures. The strategy will be revised in the course of 2014.   Liechtenstein's Ministry of Environment and the Office of Environment are the coordinating authorities with respect to the execution of the Climate Protection Strategy. Because of the small size of the country, however, cross-border cooperation plays an important role. Especially important is the relationship with Switzerland and cooperation among the countries in the Lake Constance area. Thanks to the Customs Treaty, cross-border measures and bilateral execution are simplified in many areas, since various Swiss enactments are directly applicable in Liechtenstein pursuant to the Treaty. In these cases, Liechtenstein executes the provisions similarly to a Swiss canton (e.g. mineral oil tax).    Accordingly, most policy areas are very closely linked with Swiss policy, in terms of both content and execution. Due to this circumstance Liechtenstein, as an EEA Member State, always evaluates Swiss as well as European law.   In addition to the above mentioned policies the LIFE Climate Foundation must be mentioned. The LIFE Climate Foundation is a nonprofit organization that aims at the promotion of a sustainable and credible advancement of climate and environmental protection through an effective inclusion of financial intermediaries and the general public.    Country specific issues   As Liechtenstein is a small country the financial and capacity resources are limited. In addition, Liechtenstein's engagement with regard to research and systematic observation that address international activities is very limited.   Since 2012 the Government provides financial support to the LIFE Climate Foundation Liechtenstein [4]   (established in 2009) on a regular basis.  The nonprofit foundation therefore concluded a cooperation agreement with the Swiss Climate Foundation. Since 2012 Liechtenstein based SMEs are eligible to apply for  financial support if they implement efficiency measures or if they seek financial help for the development of innovative projects that demonstrate a GHG mitigation impact. In addition, LIFE Climate Foundation is a national initiative and aims to further strengthen public awareness by organizing events and workshops which cover the topics of climate change and other ecological topics.    The foundation acts within the framework of a Public-Private Partnership. The participation of representatives from the country's economy as well as from science and policy sectors provide important access to the relevant players and driving forces within environmental and carbon markets. The close cooperation with the University of Liechtenstein's Institute for Financial Services offers the possibility to examine environmental questions related to financial issues on an academic basis.

"bulgaria  Bulgaria  country briefings    Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State ofEnvironmentreport    The national report on the state and protection of the environment is drafted annually in accordance with the Environmental Protection Act [1] .    The report consists of 16 units and contain information mainly about:Air quality, Climate change, Water quality and Water resources management, Land use and soil state, Forests, Waste, Radiation characteristics of the environment, Noise pollution, Energy production, Transport and etc.      The report is structured on the base of environmental indicators and methodologies, implemented in the assessment reports of the European Environment Agency (E). The indicators assessment is done at appropriate time periods and gives trends and conclusions, forming the 'key messages' under each relevant environmental topic.     Key findings of the State of Environment report  [2]     Industry's use ofenergy and natural resourceshas had a significantly harmful impact on the environment.   Despite the decrease in Bulgaria's energy intensity, it nevertheless remains high among European Union (EU) Member States. Based on Eurostat data in 2012 the share of renewable energy (RE) use in Bulgaria reached 16.34% as a part of the country's total energy consumption.   Table 1: Share of renewable energy use in Bulgaria           Year     2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012        RE ktoe  ( normalized)       1048   1118   1067   1183   1205   1429   1515   1680       RE share from total energy, %   9.54   9.74   9.43   10.72   12.44   14.40   16.64   16.34          Energy production remains the biggest source of sulfur dioxide emissions and one of the largest for nitrogen oxide emissions. The domination of road transport in the overall transport structure, together with its ongoing growth, is linked with an increase in fuel consumption and emissions of harmful substancesin the ambient air, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ozone precursors, and particulate matter (PM). In the transport sector, road transport is responsible for 92.54% of the total energy use. An increase in the use of bio-fuels in transport was first noticed in 2012.     Pollutants such as PM, ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and non-methane volatile organic substances create enormous problems for human health. Such pollutants areresponsiblefor adeteriorationin ecosystems with PM  10   the worst offender. For the period 1990-2012 thePM  10  precursor emissions decreased by 66%, from 885 kt to 303 kt.       Bulgaria is implementing the requirements of theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (  UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol to decrease GHG emissions by 8% for the period 2008-2012, compared to 1988.    Compared to other EU Member States, Bulgaria is distinguished by its relatively large quantities of water resources both as an absolute volume and per capita. At the same time the country has one of the highest water abstraction per capita and relies mainly on surface water sources due to the big volumes of water used for cooling in the energy production.   99% of the population has access to drinking water. After 2005 the number of Watewater Treatment Plants increased. During the past decade a gradual improvement in the quality of surface and ground water has been seen. There are still water bodies at risk and measures are in place aiming to reach good ecological status by 2015.      The country's soils have good ecological status. Water erosion, both as a territorial spread and as an average annual soil loss, has been noticed. Wind erosion has been kept at a constant.   On biodiversity, complex indicators for population trends are used in order to assess the degree of any loss. There has been a decrease in the population status of birds. The protected zones have been assessed as sufficient in regard of the representativeness of the species and the habitats.   The state of forests does not dramatically differ from the average European level. 24.2% of trees in Europe are classified as damaged, while in Bulgaria it is at 21.6%. Insects and fungal pathogens are the most responsible.   The analysis of the data for the daily noise levels measured in cities for a five year period shows that the prevailing ones are in the range 63-67 dB(A), followed by the ones at 68-72 dB(A). The measurements made by the regional health inspectorates show that the regulated admissible noise levels are exceeded in 69% of the control points around the country.   Preventing waste generation affects and depends on a wide range of stakeholders. This objective is included into national targets and is supported by the engagement of the local authorities, but ultimately depends on changing attitudes and behavior of households and businesses and on the new models in the industrial processes and the product design. There was a significant increase in the proportion of waste delivered for recovery including recycling and the quantity of hazardous waste generated in the past five years decreased by an average of about 26%. The amount of generated waste in the country decreased mainly due to administrative, economic and financial instruments. The country has achieved national targets for material recycling and recovery of packaging waste.   The cost of protecting and restoring the environment at the national level is estimated at EUR 866 million. This is equivalent to a share of 2.2% of gross domestic product (GDP). The cost has increased by 17.8% compared to 2011 and by about 32.9% compared to 2010.     Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns     In Bulgaria emphasis is increasingly placed on national environmental protection and the prevention and adaptation to climate change. The main legislative initiatives intending to increase the efficiency of the governance of environmental policies and to improve the business environment are:     Law on limiting climate change [3] , which will provide the general legal framework to implement the climate policy and the main activities and processes by which the Republic of Bulgaria is fulfilling its obligations in the field of climate change at the international level and at the European Union level.   draft amendments to the Protected Areas Act, Medical Plants Act and Biodiversity Act, to reduce the regulatory and administrative burden of regulatory regimes in relation to biodiversity conservation.   proposal for amendments to the Water Act, which mainly aims at accelerating the process of determining the sanitary - protective zones around water intake facilities for drinking water, full harmonization of the framework for Community action in the field of water policy and implementation of new higher environmental standards for water.   Amendment to the Law on the responsibility to prevent and remedy environmental damage, which are included in the Draft Law amending the Law on Genetically Modified Organisms [4]  in order to ensure effective control over the prevention and remedying of environmental damage.

Country specific issues   The five headline targets of the 'Europe 2020' strategy are adopted and transposed in national objectives and current situation and the targets for Bulgaria are following:            Table 2: National objectives in line with the 'Europe 2020' strategy'   [6]                      'Europe 2020  strategy objectives      Present situation      Objectives of the  National reforms  program 2020 [7]             3% of the GDP of EU goes for investment in scientific and research and development activities   0.6% (2012)   Increase up to 1.5%       20% decrease of GHG emissions compared to 1990 levels   minus 12% (prognosis for emissions in 2020 [8]  given 2005=100)   Increase with 20% max for sectors outside the ETS  [9]   (given 2005=100)       plus 11% (emissions in 2010 given 2005=100)       20% share of the RES in final energy consumption (incl.10% RES in the end consumption in transport)   16.4% (2012)   Increase the share to 16%       20% increase of the energy efficiency   17.4 [10]  toe (2010)   Decrease with 3,2 toe=15,8 toe       75% employment of the population aged 20-64   63.5 (2013)   Increase the employment to 76%       Under 10% share of the early school leavers   12.4% (2013)   Decrease the share to 11%       At least 40% share of the aged 30-34 completed university   29.1% (2013)   Increase the share to 36%       Reducing the number of people living at risk of poverty or exclusion with 20 million   41.6% of the population   Decrease with 260,000,Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State ofEnvironmentreport The national report on the state and protection of the environment is drafted annually in accordance with the Environmental Protection Act[1]. The report consists of 16 units and contain information mainly about:Air quality, Climate change, Water quality and Water resources management, Land use and soil state, Forests, Waste, Radiation characteristics of the environment, Noise pollution, Energy production, Transport and etc.  The report is structured on the base of environmental indicators and methodologies, implemented in the assessment reports of the European Environment Agency (E). The indicators assessment is done at appropriate time periods and gives trends and conclusions, forming the 'key messages' under each relevant environmental topic.  Key findings of the State of Environment report[2] Industry's use ofenergy and natural resourceshas had a significantly harmful impact on the environment. Despite the decrease in Bulgaria's energy intensity, it nevertheless remains high among European Union (EU) Member States. Based on Eurostat data in 2012 the share of renewable energy (RE) use in Bulgaria reached 16.34% as a part of the country's total energy consumption. Table 1: Share of renewable energy use in Bulgaria   Year20052006200720082009201020112012   RE ktoe (normalized)  1048 1118 1067 1183 1205 1429 1515 1680   RE share from total energy, % 9.54 9.74 9.43 10.72 12.44 14.40 16.64 16.34    Energy production remains the biggest source of sulfur dioxide emissions and one of the largest for nitrogen oxide emissions. The domination of road transport in the overall transport structure, together with its ongoing growth, is linked with an increase in fuel consumption and emissions of harmful substancesin the ambient air, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ozone precursors, and particulate matter (PM). In the transport sector, road transport is responsible for 92.54% of the total energy use. An increase in the use of bio-fuels in transport was first noticed in 2012. Pollutants such as PM, ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and non-methane volatile organic substances create enormous problems for human health. Such pollutants areresponsiblefor adeteriorationin ecosystems with PM10 the worst offender. For the period 1990-2012 thePM10precursor emissions decreased by 66%, from 885 kt to 303 kt. Bulgaria is implementing the requirements of theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol to decrease GHG emissions by 8% for the period 2008-2012, compared to 1988. Compared to other EU Member States, Bulgaria is distinguished by its relatively large quantities of water resources both as an absolute volume and per capita. At the same time the country has one of the highest water abstraction per capita and relies mainly on surface water sources due to the big volumes of water used for cooling in the energy production. 99% of the population has access to drinking water. After 2005 the number of Watewater Treatment Plants increased. During the past decade a gradual improvement in the quality of surface and ground water has been seen. There are still water bodies at risk and measures are in place aiming to reach good ecological status by 2015.  The country's soils have good ecological status. Water erosion, both as a territorial spread and as an average annual soil loss, has been noticed. Wind erosion has been kept at a constant. On biodiversity, complex indicators for population trends are used in order to assess the degree of any loss. There has been a decrease in the population status of birds. The protected zones have been assessed as sufficient in regard of the representativeness of the species and the habitats. The state of forests does not dramatically differ from the average European level. 24.2% of trees in Europe are classified as damaged, while in Bulgaria it is at 21.6%. Insects and fungal pathogens are the most responsible. The analysis of the data for the daily noise levels measured in cities for a five year period shows that the prevailing ones are in the range 63-67 dB(A), followed by the ones at 68-72 dB(A). The measurements made by the regional health inspectorates show that the regulated admissible noise levels are exceeded in 69% of the control points around the country. Preventing waste generation affects and depends on a wide range of stakeholders. This objective is included into national targets and is supported by the engagement of the local authorities, but ultimately depends on changing attitudes and behavior of households and businesses and on the new models in the industrial processes and the product design. There was a significant increase in the proportion of waste delivered for recovery including recycling and the quantity of hazardous waste generated in the past five years decreased by an average of about 26%. The amount of generated waste in the country decreased mainly due to administrative, economic and financial instruments. The country has achieved national targets for material recycling and recovery of packaging waste. The cost of protecting and restoring the environment at the national level is estimated at EUR 866 million. This is equivalent to a share of 2.2% of gross domestic product (GDP). The cost has increased by 17.8% compared to 2011 and by about 32.9% compared to 2010.  Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns  In Bulgaria emphasis is increasingly placed on national environmental protection and the prevention and adaptation to climate change. The main legislative initiatives intending to increase the efficiency of the governance of environmental policies and to improve the business environment are:  Law on limiting climate change[3], which will provide the general legal framework to implement the climate policy and the main activities and processes by which the Republic of Bulgaria is fulfilling its obligations in the field of climate change at the international level and at the European Union level. draft amendments to the Protected Areas Act, Medical Plants Act and Biodiversity Act, to reduce the regulatory and administrative burden of regulatory regimes in relation to biodiversity conservation. proposal for amendments to the Water Act, which mainly aims at accelerating the process of determining the sanitary - protective zones around water intake facilities for drinking water, full harmonization of the framework for Community action in the field of water policy and implementation of new higher environmental standards for water. Amendment to the Law on the responsibility to prevent and remedy environmental damage, which are included in the Draft Law amending the Law on Genetically Modified Organisms[4] in order to ensure effective control over the prevention and remedying of environmental damage. A new Waste Management Act[5], which updates the requirements for waste management and establishes national targets for recycling of household and construction waste.  Priority: Protection and improvement of water resources status Providing further development and implementation of specific economic principles such as 'polluter pays' and the principle of cost recovery in the water sector.

"spain  Spain  country briefings     Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report      Starting in 2004, the indicator based report   Environmental Profile of Spain   [1]      has been published every year. It provides an annual snapshot of the environmental situation in the country, analyses major pressures on the environment and monitors effectiveness of policies. Since 2012, the report is available through an 'app'   [2]    developed for tablets and smart phones. It describes 82 indicators organized in 17 environmental and sector areas: Air Quality and atmospheric emissions, Water, Land, Nature, Coasts and marine environment, Green Economy, Environmental Research, Development and Innovation, Waste, Agriculture, Energy, Industry, Fishing, Tourism, Transport, Households, Urban environment, Natural and technological disasters. There is also a chapter devoted to autonomous communities.     Key findings of the State of Environment report    Social and economic aspects      In 2012   Spain   was the fifth most populated country in the EU-27 and had the fourth highest population growth during the 2000 to 2012 period (+15.3 %). From 2002 to 2009 Spanish GDP, measured in terms of purchasing power parity, was above the EU-27 average.      Air quality and emissions to the atmosphere     In 2012, Spain was responsible for 7.5% of the total emissions of the EU-28, emitting 7.28 tonnes of CO2-eq/inhabitant, a figure lower than the average values recorded in the European Union: 9.0 tonnes of CO2-eq/inhabitant. In relation with the GDP, Spain was also one of the countries with lower emissions and in order to produce a GDP unit, 0.33 kg of CO2-eq were released in 2012, whereas in the EU-28, such figure amounted to 0.35 kg of CO2-eq. Troposphere ozone precursor emissions during the 1990-2011 period decreased by 25.3 %. PM 10 emissions have fallen by 23.8 % since 2000, while PM 2.5 fell by 22.5 %.    Water   Consumption per capita from public water supply decreased by 175 litres in 2004 to 142 litres in 2011. By 2009, 28.64% of the  5 125 total surface water bodies in Spain were in 'good' status. By 2012 more than half of the sampling points for fresh water bathing zones had 'excellent quality'. Zones classified as 'poor quality' decreased whilst 'good quality' zones increased.      Land     Corine Land Cover for 2006 established that only 2 % of the total surface area in Spain is covered by artificial surface, one of the lowest in the EU and well below 4.6% of EU average. Soil erosion is a challenge in Spain. 12 % of the country (6 million hectares) suffered from erosion process (soil losses> 50 tons of soil/ha/year). Desertification can be considered serious (grades of 'very high' and 'high') in 17.85 % of the Spanish surface area.      Nature    By 2012, the Natura 2000 network represented 27.19% of the total Spanish area. The total forest area covered more than 27.5 million hectares (55% of the country's surface). The total woodland area is over 18 million hectares, representing 0.39 hectares/inhabitant.

As part of the strategy to reduce of GHG emissions, 37 climate projects were selected which will allow for a reduction up to 800 000 tonnes of CO 2 equivalent.   Waste   In 2011 total municipal waste production and waste production per inhabitant decreased to 531 kg/inhabitant. The rates for packaging waste recycling and recovery increased. Spain has a paper and cardboard recycling rate close to 80%.   Agriculture and fishing    In 2011 Spain was the European country with the largest land area dedicated to organic farming at 1 845 039 hectares. In 2012, irrigated land surface was 3 522 616  hectares , which was approximately 16% of the EU's total cultivated surface area. In 2011 the capacity of the Spanish fishing fleet continued to decrease. Total production in aquaculture in 2011 experienced a yearonyear increase of 3.3%, reaching 291 235 tonnes.   Transport   In 2011, 47.1% of all vehicles used gasoline and 52.9% diesel. There has been an increase in number of hybrid vehicles with approximately 20 700 registered vehicles.     Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns     Air    The   National     Plan for Air Quality and Atmosphere Protection 2013 2016      [4]   (adopted in 2013)   sets the framework to improve air quality through specific actions undertaken in coordination with   other   sectoral plans aiming     at   promoting awareness and improving the information available on emissions from pollutants. Furthermore, in order to encourage take-up of vehicles with higher energy efficiency levels, incentives were set up forlower fuel consumption and CO   2    emissions and other pollutants from cars and vans. Since 2012 several Programs and Projects for the non-ETS sectors within the second period of the Kyoto Protocol (2013-2020) has been developed, such as the   Climate Projects     for promoting economic development and employment creation within the framework of the fight against the climate change, and the estimation of the   'Carbon Footprint  . Different Plans focusing on specific sectors have been set up such as   PIMA SOL   which promotes the reduction of GHG emissions in hotel and other tourism facilities through energy efficiency improvements, etc.     Biodiversity    Spain   is the first country of EU-  28 in   terms of contribution to the Natura 2000 network with nearly 17% of the European net. The Network of National Parks is an integrated system for the protection and management of natural areas of an outstanding value for the Spanish Natural Heritage. Therefore, the   conservation of biodiversity   is a major concern. Two examples of recent actions aiming at protecting the nature are:         The regulation of   invasive alien species  , with the approval in 2013 of Royal Decree 630/2013, of August 2, whereby the Spanish list of invasive alien species is regulated.     The integration of the environment in the   tourism economic activity  , through the approval of asectoral plan of nature tourism and biodiversity 2014-2020.      Water    The transposition of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) to the Spanish legislation in December 2003 has led to a redirecting of Spanish water policy and hydrological planning including the following priorities:      Changing the governance model: the transition towards a sustainable water model from an economic, social and environmental perspective.   Strengthening water security and making significant progress in the sustainable management of water resources (Green growth).   Developing sanitation and water treatment within the urban cycle.     Coast     Spain has made important progresses in the development of the Marine Protected Areas Network, going in 2014 from 1% to 8% of marine surface protected (Spain has more than 1 million km   2    of jurisdictional seas). A State Plan for the Protection of the seaside against the marine pollution has also been adopted, and marine strategies are being designed in order to achieve good environmental status of all Spanish marine waters by 2020.     Waste    The decrease for waste per inhabitant is a consequence of the     National Integrated Plan of Waste       (PNIR 20082015)  [5]  , as well as of the implementation of prevention measures at autonomous communitiesand local level, and greater engagement from citizens. In 2013 Spain developed a State Waste Prevention Programme for the period 2014 to 2020 with the objective of reducing waste by 10 % by 2020.        Country specific issues     Regarding  environment and health two initiatives could be outlined  :      The Spanish Monitoring Planassessesthe effectiveness of the measures taken to reduce POPs. Focused is on air at strategic points at 13 remoteand 9 urban stations, using the EMEP network in collaboration with the Spanish Agency ofMeteorology (AEMET).   Human biological bio monitoring (HBM) has become the gold standard in pollutant exposure estimations in humans. It relies on measures of selected pollutants in air, water, food and soil, and promotes the design of a system to estimate the levels of selected pollutants in a representative sample of Spanish adults.      Regarding  natural heritageconservation:     The Spanish Inventory of Traditional Knowledge on biodiversity in the framework of the Spanish Inventory on Natural Heritage and biodiversity provides the basis to preserve and promote traditional knowledge relevant to the conservation of biodiversity. At least 1 927 species (25 % of all vascular plants) are associated with traditional use.   Regarding biodiversity, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment in Spain is the first analysis performed for the status and trends of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and their contribution to human welfare.   In coast and marine environment, the LIFE+ INDEMARES Project aimed toquantifythe Nature 2000 network in the Spanish marine environment over the past five years. It has protected more than seven million hectares of marine area.      In relation to the  water environment :      Spain has introduced the environmental flows (e-flows) in the first planning cycle as a prior restriction imposed in general systems of exploitation that guarantees the maintenance of ecosystems. Moreover, e-flows are considered a mandatory content of the river basin water management plans (art. 42). Spain is leading a European working group to share these experience and knowledge.   The National Strategy for River Restoration emerged in 2006 with the ultimate goal to improve the ecological status of all Spanish water courses.     On Climate Change:     A number ofinitiatives have arisen from the 2006Spanish Climate Change Adaptation Plan,including a Health and Climate Change Observatory, a report on the impacts on health by climate change, tools such as C3E (climate change on the Spanish coast) and sectorial workshops for wildlife, agriculture, education or forestry stakeholders.       In the field of energy, the project for the connection of the mainland electricity system with the Balearic Islands ensures a power supply via renewable energies. By 2013 electric power exchanges had provided an export balance of 1 266 GWh to the Balearic Islands, covering 22.3 % of demand. An evaluation in the first 120 days estimated annual emissions savings of 234 000 tons of CO2., Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report  Starting in 2004, the indicator based report Environmental Profile of Spain[1] has been published every year.

Waste The decrease for waste per inhabitant is a consequence of the National Integrated Plan of Waste (PNIR 20082015)[5], as well as of the implementation of prevention measures at autonomous communitiesand local level, and greater engagement from citizens. In 2013 Spain developed a State Waste Prevention Programme for the period 2014 to 2020 with the objective of reducing waste by 10 % by 2020.  Country specific issues Regardingenvironment and health two initiatives could be outlined:  The Spanish Monitoring Planassessesthe effectiveness of the measures taken to reduce POPs. Focused is on air at strategic points at 13 remoteand 9 urban stations, using the EMEP network in collaboration with the Spanish Agency ofMeteorology (AEMET). Human biological bio monitoring (HBM) has become the gold standard in pollutant exposure estimations in humans. It relies on measures of selected pollutants in air, water, food and soil, and promotes the design of a system to estimate the levels of selected pollutants in a representative sample of Spanish adults.  Regarding natural heritageconservation:  The Spanish Inventory of Traditional Knowledge on biodiversity in the framework of the Spanish Inventory on Natural Heritage and biodiversity provides the basis to preserve and promote traditional knowledge relevant to the conservation of biodiversity. At least 1 927 species (25 % of all vascular plants) are associated with traditional use. Regarding biodiversity, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment in Spain is the first analysis performed for the status and trends of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and their contribution to human welfare. In coast and marine environment, the LIFE+ INDEMARES Project aimed toquantifythe Nature 2000 network in the Spanish marine environment over the past five years. It has protected more than seven million hectares of marine area.  In relation to the water environment:  Spain has introduced the environmental flows (e-flows) in the first planning cycle as a prior restriction imposed in general systems of exploitation that guarantees the maintenance of ecosystems. Moreover, e-flows are considered a mandatory content of the river basin water management plans (art. 42). Spain is leading a European working group to share these experience and knowledge. The National Strategy for River Restoration emerged in 2006 with the ultimate goal to improve the ecological status of all Spanish water courses.  On Climate Change:  A number ofinitiatives have arisen from the 2006Spanish Climate Change Adaptation Plan,including a Health and Climate Change Observatory, a report on the impacts on health by climate change, tools such as C3E (climate change on the Spanish coast) and sectorial workshops for wildlife, agriculture, education or forestry stakeholders.   In the field of energy, the project for the connection of the mainland electricity system with the Balearic Islands ensures a power supply via renewable energies. By 2013 electric power exchanges had provided an export balance of 1 266 GWh to the Balearic Islands, covering 22.3 % of demand. An evaluation in the first 120 days estimated annual emissions savings of 234 000 tons of CO2. "
"waste  Waste  waste prevention waste management recycling waste policies municipal waste environmental themes         Context    Europe can secure many social and economic benefits from treating  waste as a resource . In addition to reducing environmental pressures, better waste management can secure vital resources, create jobs and boost competitiveness. Waste prevention and management have a central role in enhancing resource efficiency and  creating a circular economy  that enables society to maximise the economic returns on scarce resources.   The European Union (EU) has introduced multiple waste policies and targets since the 1990s. As in  other environmental areas , [ 1 ]  the focus of waste policy has broadened over this period. Examples of policy instruments include:     legislation on specific waste streams, such as packaging, [ 2 ]  vehicles [ 3 ]  and electrical and electronic equipment; [ 4 ][ 5 ]    legislation and guidance on waste treatment options, such as landfilling, [ 6 ] waste treatment industries [ 7 ]  and waste incineration; [ 8 ][ 9 ]    legislation on the environmental performance of products, such as ecodesign [ 10 ][ 11 ]  and restrictions of the use of certain hazardous substances; [ 12 ][ 13 ]    framework legislation and strategies, such as the Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste [ 14 ]  and the Waste Framework Directive. [ 15 ]      The overarching logic guiding EU policy on waste is the waste hierarchy, which prioritises waste prevention, followed by reuse, recycling, other recovery, and finally disposal or landfilling as the least desirable option.   Key trends   In broad terms, Europe has shifted  waste management  up the waste hierarchy in recent years. Although differences in national waste definitions and data processing methodologies introduce some uncertainties into an analysis of European trends, there is evidence that less waste is being  landfilled  as a result of reduced generation of some wastes, and increased recycling and energy recovery.   Waste prevention    Economic production and  consumption  in Europe is becoming less waste intensive, even after the economic downturn since 2008 is factored into the analysis. For example, as illustrated in Figure 1, waste generation from manufacturing in the EU-28 and Norway declined by 25% in absolute terms between 2004 and 2012, despite an increase of 7% in sectoral economic output. Waste generation from the service sectordeclined by 23% in the same period, despite an increase of 13% in sectoral economic output.   Turning to consumption, total   municipal waste generation in EEA countries   declined by 2% between 2004 and 2012, despite a 7% increase in real household expenditure. Per capita generation of municipal waste declined by 5% in the same period, falling from 503 to 478 kg/capita.   Figure 1: Waste generation by production and consumption activities in European countries        Waste management    Europe achieved substantial progress in diverting waste from landfill in recent years  both in absolute terms and as a proportion of total waste generated. Between 2004 and 2010, the EU-28, Iceland and Norway reduced the amount of total waste (excluding mineral, combustion, animal and vegetable wastes) deposited in landfills by 23%; from 205billion tonnes to 157 billion tonnes.   The decrease in landfilling is partly due to increased  recycling  and  incineration of waste . Recycling rates tend to have improved fastest in waste streams with EU-wide targets. [ 16 ][ 17 ] In 2011,  EEA countries  (excluding Iceland, Croatia and Turkey) recycled 63% of their packaging waste, up from 57% in 2006. For municipal waste, EEA countries achieved a recycling rate of 37% in 2012, compared to 28% in 2004. These improvements reflected an increase in the recycling of materials, with only very modest improvements in the recycling of biowaste. [ 17 ]    Transboundary movements of waste   Driven by EU trade legislation and recycling targets along with escalating resource demand in fast growing Asian economies exports of waste from EU Member States have grown significantly. Exports of waste iron, steel, copper, aluminium and nickel doubled between 1999 and 2011. Waste precious metal exports increased by a factor of three and waste plastics by a factor of five. Exports of hazardous waste more than doubled in the period 20002009, although these overwhelmingly stayed in the EU. [ 18 ]     Transboundary movements of waste  can enable access to recycling or disposal options that are unavailable or more costly in the source country  meaning lower financial costs for waste management and potentially also lower environmental costs. Trade can also facilitate using waste as an input to production. However, moving waste across borders can involve costs and risks, such as illegal movements of hazardous electronic waste (e-waste). Since informal sector workers in developing countries lack the equipment and skills to handle e-waste safely, the result is significant environmental pollution and  health risk s for local people, as well as the loss of valuable materials. [ 18 ]    Reduced environmental harm   Improved waste management reduces pressures associated with both waste disposal (e.g. pollution from incineration or landfilling) and with extracting and processing new resources. The EEA estimates that improved municipal waste management in the EU-27, Switzerland and Norway cut annual net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 57 million tonnes CO 2 -equivalent in the period 19902012, with most of that reduction occurring since 2000. The two main factors responsible were reduced methane emissions from landfill and avoided emissions through recycling. [ 19 ]    Figure 2: Greenhouse gas emissions from municipal waste management in the EU-27, Switzerland and Norway        Prospects   The EU estimates that full implementation of existing EU waste legislation could save EUR 72 billion a year by 2020, while  creating over 400 000 jobs and increasing annual EU waste management and recycling sectorturnover by EUR 42 billion. [ 20 ] Better recycling infrastructures, collection and recycling rates could also alleviate European reliance on resource imports, boosting security of supply of some of the critical resources used in new technologies. [ 21 ] Securing these potential gains will require Member States to achieve the full spectrum of EU waste targets.   Analysis by the EEA [ 17 ][ 22 ]  suggests that progress towards waste targets is mixed. Many Member States seem likely to achieve the target of recycling 50% of some fractions of household and similar wastes by 2020 (although Decision 2011/753/EC enables countries to choose between four different methods for calculating recycling rates, producing different results). But achieving other targets, such as the EU's 'near zero landfill' target in 2020, will depend on a significant change in approaches to current waste management practices.   Policy tools such as taxes or bans on specific wastes or management approaches, pay-as-you-throw schemes and extended producer responsibility could all enable a shift up the waste hierarchy. [ 17 ] The large differences in waste management and progress to targets across Europe underline the importance of national and local instruments such as landfill taxes and bans, mandatory separate collection and waste collection fees that encourage recycling.   Measures that deter landfilling can produce adverse effects if they result in illegal dumping of waste or the development of undesirable alternatives, such as excessive incineration capacity or low-quality mechanical biological treatment for mixed waste types. Tools such as landfill taxes therefore need to be complemented with additional measures, for example enhanced supervisory systems and incentives for preferred waste management approaches.   Moving beyond existing policy targets, the Roadmap to a resource-efficient Europe [ 23 ]  and the 7th Environment Action Programme [ 20 ]  also signal a new level of ambition in applying the logic of the waste hierarchy, including additional goals on waste prevention and using waste as a resource. As a first step towards these goals, the European Commission is reviewing the EU's targets on municipal and packaging waste. [ 24 ]    Achieving the EU's medium- and long-term objectives will require more far-reaching changes, extending beyond the waste sector and engaging all actors in establishing a circular economy. Minimising waste or making it less harmful depends on actions across the full product lifecycle. Factors such as design and choice of material inputs play a major role in determining a product's useful lifespan, the amount of resources and energy used in production, and the possibilities for repairing it, reusing parts or recycling.   Technological and social innovations can also offer new ways to meet society's demand for products and services. Examples include resource-efficient production processes, re-manufacturing, industrial symbiosis, product-service systems, collaborative consumption and take-back schemes. EU and national policy should create the incentives and enabling frameworks to support new business models that can realise these innovations. This could include helping establish new markets for recycled materials.   These measures can contribute to achieving the potential economic and environmental benefits of sustainable waste management. For Europe to fully understand its progress towards these benefits, improvements in information on waste flows is required.

"denmark  Denmark  country briefings    Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report    The Danish SOER [1]    provides an overview of the current state and describes trends and indicators. This helps to provide clarity and perspective for politicians, interest groups and citizens. The SOER is an independent analysis prepared by a third party.   The main themes of the 2014 report are covered within 10 thematic chapters:      Land use,     Air,     Water,     Sea,     Climate change,     Nature and Biodiversity,     Natural Resources,     Environment and Health,     Production, Consumption and Waste,     Environmental policy.       Key findings of the State of Environment report    The 2014 SOER concludes that in some areas the environmental status has considerably improved over recent years and decades. Nevertheless significant challenges remain.   The content of pesticides in ground water has been reduced; the air has become significantly cleaner and the state of Danish lakes and streams has improved. However, these improvements are not sufficient to meet the objectives for water bodies, biodiversity is under pressure, a great part of Danish nature is still in an unfavorable condition, and resource consumption is among the highest in the world.   Land use  Agriculture occupies more than 60% of Denmark's area. Forest area is increasing and approximately 14.1% of Denmark's total area is covered by forest. The nitrogen load is decreasing, but the use of pesticides still exceeds national targets. Over the past 18 years the area of organic farming has increased approximately by a factor of 4.   Air Air quality is overall improving, but remains a challenge in densely populated areas. Emissions of nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, and heavy metals are decreasing. Fine particles, especially from wood stoves and diesel driven means of transport, continue to pose a challenge. In Copenhagen NO 2  levels remain above the EU limit values (see Fig. 1).       Figure 1: NO 2  levels in Copenhagen, 2001-2012        Source:  Natur og Milj 2014     Water  Danish water consumption has decreased by 25-30% over the last 20 years. The environmental state in Danish lakes and streams has improved over the last 20 years. The condition in lakes and coast waters is still affected by excessive inputs of nutrients and hazardous substances and streams by poor physical  conditions and inputs of organic matter. Groundwater condition has generally improved. Residues of pesticides and excess nitrate, however, still cause problems in parts of the groundwater resource.    Sea  The land based discharge of nitrogen to the inner Danish waters has been reduced by approximately 50% since 1990. Despite this effort many areas still suffer from an oxygen deficit. Overall, fishing has become more sustainable, however a number of stocks including the cod still remains under pressure. Contamination with pollutants such as TBT (tributyltin) and PAH (polyaromatic hydrocarbons)in blue mussels is declining, but the concentration of mercury is still above the environmental quality standards.    Climate change  Changes in the global climate have been particularly pronounced in recent years. Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) have started to decline. Total emissions have decreased in the period 1990 to 2012, while the global concentration of CO  2   in the atmosphere continuously sets new records. Temperature, annual precipitation and the number of storms have increased and the sea levels have risen.    Nature and Biodiversity  Open natural habitats are threatened by the impacts from nutrients which lead to overgrowth and a few dominant nutrient-requiring species of vegetation. Biodiversity continues to decline in many spheres but there are also some areas in which the speed of decline has slowed. Nutrient discharge into watercourses, lakes and seas has been significantly reduced since 1990, and there are signs of positive development in the biodiversity of aquatic environments.    Natural resources  Material consumption per capita has declined since 2006 and is on par with the levels of the late 1990s. Denmark's global ecological footprint has also decreased slightly, but remains one of the world's largest. Total energy consumption has decreased by 7% from 1990 to 2012. Denmark's share of renewable energy was 23% of total energy consumptionin 2012  (not including incineration of waste).         Environment and health  In 2011 air pollution caused an estimated 3 200 premature deaths. There is still a need to reduce the risk of using chemicals. Unwanted chemicals can be measured in blood, urine and hair and they are,  inter alia , under suspicion for being related to certain forms of hormone-related cancer diseases.    Production, Consumption and Waste  In 2013 production of green products generated a turnover of DKK 164 billion of which almost half is from renewable energy  [3]  .    Denmark is one of the countries in Europe producing most municipal waste per inhabitant.   The amount of total waste produced per capita per year is approximately 1.8 tonnes. A total of 63 % of this was recycled, 29 % was incinerated and 6 % ended up in landfills  [12]    .    Transverse environmental themes  Public expenditure on environmental protection has decreased by approximately 20% over the past decade. The ratio of green taxes in relation to GDP has declined steadily from 2000 to 2012, but is still among the highest in the EU. Denmark is placed 13  th   in the Environmental Performance Index, above the European average.    Main policy responses to key environmental challenges and concerns   Nature   Afforestation: during the period 2010 to 2013 approximately 6 900 ha of forest (state and private) have been established. There is an emphasis on forests located close to cities.   Commission on Nature and Agriculture 2013: the Commission developed 144 recommendations on how to create development and growth in the agricultural industry and simultaneously boosting nature, the environment and climate action.   National Pesticide Action Plan 2013-2015:works towards a 40% reduction in pesticide load from 2011 to 2015, inter alia, by introducing a tax on pesticides.   Nature Fund:a National Nature Fund is under establishment with the purpose improving the state of nature and the aquatic environment in Denmark.      Nature Plan [4] :In 2014 the government launched Nature Plan Denmark, a new, long-term and comprehensive plan for how Denmarks nature becomes more rich and coherent. Among the initiatives is the development of a new Green Denmark map that will show where our existing and potential valuable natural and endangered animals and plants can be found, the establishment of approximately 25,000 hectares of new nature and a ban on spreading manure and use insecticides around 35,000 hectares of protected nature areas.    Climate   Initiatives on Climate:the government has drawn up a Climate Plan aiming to reduce GHG emissions by 40% in 2020 (compared to 1990-levels); a Climate Law that secures drive and transparency in reaching the 40%-goal; and a Climate Council to provide expert counselling on the path towards a low emission society.   The Energy Agreement 2012-2020:the initiatives follow the Government's long term commitment to ensure that energy supply in 2050 will be 100% based on renewable energy.   Municipality Agreement 2013 and Action plan for a climate-proof Denmark 2012:involves 63 national initiatives on climate change adaptation including law changes to assist the implementation of local adaptation action plans made by all Danish municipalities.   Chemicals   Chemicals initiative 2014-2017 [5] : a total of DKK 185 million has been allocatedto enhanced implementation and better regulation of SVHC in REACH, the establishment of a chemical-forum and other initiatives.    Resources   Resource strategy 2013 [6] :The strategy is expected to result in 50% recycling of certain fractions of household waste.   Air quality   Tax on NOx emissions: a tax on NOx emissions was introduced in 2010. In 2012 the fee was increased from 5 DKK/kg NOx to 25 DKK/kg NOx.    Train Fund:28.5 billion DKK has been set aside to improve the Danish railway system.   Clean air action plan:149 million DKK have been allocated to, inter alia, cleaner buses in Copenhagen and targeted action to reduce particle pollution from stoves and ships.   Country specific issues    As the EU administrator of the China Europe Water Platform [7] , Denmark prioritizes activities in order to improve cooperation on the management of water in order to secure water supply, food security and ecological security. The Danish government, together with the governments of Korea and Mexico, launched the Global Green Growth Forum (3GF) [8] . 3GF convenes governments, businesses, investors and international organizations to act together for inclusive green growth. Furthermore, Denmark has a leading position in arctic research, and works to ensure a sustainable future for the Arctic region in corporation with Greenland and the Faroe Islands [9] .   Nationally aGreen Transition Fund has been established to support the development of new business models, product innovation, re-designs of existing products and promoting sustainable materials in product designs. Also a fund for Green Pioneers, engaging civil society and organizations has been established.   The national research and innovation policy has a special focus on green innovation in the areas of energy, transport, agriculture and environment. In 2014, grant schemes are expected to provide DKK 1.5 billion in grants to development and demonstration of green technology.   A Forum for Sustainable Procurement [10]  has been established to promote responsible and environmentally conscious procurement by professional purchasers. A Partnership on Green Public Procurement [11] has been launched as a cooperative measure between public institutions at municipal, regional and national level.,Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report The Danish SOER[1] provides an overview of the current state and describes trends and indicators.

Unwanted chemicals can be measured in blood, urine and hair and they are, inter alia, under suspicion for being related to certain forms of hormone-related cancer diseases. Production, Consumption and WasteIn 2013 production of green products generated a turnover of DKK 164 billion of which almost half is from renewable energy[3]. Denmark is one of the countries in Europe producing most municipal waste per inhabitant.The amount of total waste produced per capita per year is approximately 1.8 tonnes. A total of 63 % of this was recycled, 29 % was incinerated and 6 % ended up in landfills[12]. Transverse environmental themesPublic expenditure on environmental protection has decreased by approximately 20% over the past decade. The ratio of green taxes in relation to GDP has declined steadily from 2000 to 2012, but is still among the highest in the EU. Denmark is placed 13th in the Environmental Performance Index, above the European average. Main policy responses to key environmental challenges and concerns Nature Afforestation: during the period 2010 to 2013 approximately 6 900 ha of forest (state and private) have been established. There is an emphasis on forests located close to cities. Commission on Nature and Agriculture 2013: the Commission developed 144 recommendations on how to create development and growth in the agricultural industry and simultaneously boosting nature, the environment and climate action. National Pesticide Action Plan 2013-2015:works towards a 40% reduction in pesticide load from 2011 to 2015, inter alia, by introducing a tax on pesticides. Nature Fund:a National Nature Fund is under establishment with the purpose improving the state of nature and the aquatic environment in Denmark. Nature Plan[4]:In 2014 the government launched Nature Plan Denmark, a new, long-term and comprehensive plan for how Denmarks nature becomes more rich and coherent. Among the initiatives is the development of a new Green Denmark map that will show where our existing and potential valuable natural and endangered animals and plants can be found, the establishment of approximately 25,000 hectares of new nature and a ban on spreading manure and use insecticides around 35,000 hectares of protected nature areas. Climate Initiatives on Climate:the government has drawn up a Climate Plan aiming to reduce GHG emissions by 40% in 2020 (compared to 1990-levels); a Climate Law that secures drive and transparency in reaching the 40%-goal; and a Climate Council to provide expert counselling on the path towards a low emission society. The Energy Agreement 2012-2020:the initiatives follow the Government's long term commitment to ensure that energy supply in 2050 will be 100% based on renewable energy. Municipality Agreement 2013 and Action plan for a climate-proof Denmark 2012:involves 63 national initiatives on climate change adaptation including law changes to assist the implementation of local adaptation action plans made by all Danish municipalities. Chemicals Chemicals initiative 2014-2017[5]: atotal of DKK 185 million has been allocatedto enhanced implementation and better regulation of SVHC in REACH, the establishment of a chemical-forum and other initiatives. Resources Resource strategy 2013[6]:The strategy is expected to result in 50% recycling of certain fractions of household waste. Air quality Tax on NOx emissions:a tax on NOx emissions was introduced in 2010. In 2012 the fee was increased from 5 DKK/kg NOx to 25 DKK/kg NOx. Train Fund:28.5 billion DKK has been set aside to improve the Danish railway system. Clean air action plan:149 million DKK have been allocated to, inter alia, cleaner buses in Copenhagen and targeted action to reduce particle pollution from stoves and ships. Country specific issues  As the EU administrator of the China Europe Water Platform[7], Denmark prioritizes activities in order to improve cooperation on the management of water in order to secure water supply, food security and ecological security. The Danish government, together with the governments of Korea and Mexico, launched the Global Green Growth Forum (3GF)[8]. 3GF convenes governments, businesses, investors and international organizations to act together for inclusive green growth. Furthermore, Denmark has a leading position in arctic research, and works to ensure a sustainable future for the Arctic region in corporation with Greenland and the Faroe Islands[9]. Nationally aGreen Transition Fund has been established to support the development of new business models, product innovation, re-designs of existing products and promoting sustainable materials in product designs. Also a fund for Green Pioneers, engaging civil society and organizations has been established. The national research and innovation policy has a special focus on green innovation in the areas of energy, transport, agriculture and environment. In 2014, grant schemes are expected to provide DKK 1.5 billion in grants to development and demonstration of green technology. A Forum for Sustainable Procurement[10] has been established to promote responsible and environmentally conscious procurement by professional purchasers. A Partnership on Green Public Procurement[11]has been launched as a cooperative measure between public institutions at municipal, regional and national level."
"agriculture  Agriculture  socio-economy farmland biodiversity cap farming farmland        Context       Agriculture  has shaped  Europe's landscapes for thousands of years and it still is one of the principle sectors impacting on  Europe's environment. Since the 1950s, traditional farm management, which favoured a range of landscapes, habitats and plant and animal species, was replaced by a rapid industrialisation of agriculture characterised by a wide-spread intensification of farming methods. These were often subsidized. This has resulted in farm specialisation, increased use of chemical inputs and machinery as well as open and homogeneous landscapes. Concurrently, remaining agricultural land with natural constraints has been subjected to marginalisation and abandonment. This is also as a result of wider socio-economic changes in the rural communities.   These parallel phenomena have caused a significant decline in  biodiversity  across European farmland, including the genetic diversity of crops and livestock, and exerted various other pressures on  Europe's environment. Nutrient emissions to air and water have caused  eutrophication  of habitats and  ecosystems . Intensification has often had undesirable impacts on  soils , often leading to reductions in organic soil matter and biodiversity, contamination of groundwaters and less productive land.  Europe's agriculture has received sustained support under the  Common Agricultural Policy  (CAP) over the last 50 years. This support has evolved over time, spurred by the growing recognition of  agriculture's impacts on the environment. Unfortunately, the CAP had not changed sufficiently to reduce overall biodiversity loss. [ 1 ]    Today European farming systems serve different societal demands. The provision of food, however, remains their primary function. Food security, i.e. stable access to affordable food supply of sufficient quality, continues to receiverenewed attention on the  European Union's (EU) policy agenda. Farming and rural land management also provide other crucial and often under-appreciated  ecosystem services  (such as pollination, pest control or nutrient recycling) and functions such as flood prevention and cultural benefits.    The   recent CAP reform   for the period 2014 to 2020 aims to respond to the three main challenges facing the sector: economic, environmental and territorial. The reform may be broadly summarised as guaranteeing food security and improving environmental performance in rural areas which are faced with large-scale competition for land, reflecting rapid changes in the socio-economic situation. An important feature of the new CAP is the recognition that farmers should be rewarded for the services they provide to the public even though they might not have a market value.        Key trends      The long-term sustainability of agriculture and the ability of agro-ecosystems to provide services beyond  food production is being undermined by environmentally-harmful farming practices. These cause soil degradation and water contamination, as well as declines in pollinators, the loss of natural biological control of pests and diseases, and of plant and animal genetic diversity. [ 2 ][ 3 ]    Currently agriculture covers roughly 40% of land in the EU. Land cover changes between 2000 and 2006 show that farmland gave way to built-up areas and forest, either through afforestation or spontaneous growth on abandoned land. Most of the agricultural land in Europe converted to artificial surfaces is taken up by the housing sector (38%). [ 4 ]  Despite the decrease in the total area of farmland, productivity of European agriculture increased significantly, particularly in the second half of the 20th century as a result of intensification and specialisation.   The total number of farmers in Europe was halved between 1990 and 2010. For several decades, the number of farms in the EU has been on a downward trend. Average farm size is now bigger in terms of agricultural area as well as in economic terms. However, farming in Europe is still carried out primarily on small or very small holdings. [ 5 ]    Agricultural production contributes to  greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions, via methane produced by livestock and emissions from agricultural soils. However, emissions from the agricultural sector have declined by 22% since 1990.   Although there are strong national differences, overall pesticide use across Europe declined in the period 20002009. New pesticides in use, whose active ingredients are more concentrated, lead to a decline in volume of pesticide use without a subsequent decline in environmental impact. [ 6 ]    The implementation of the  Nitrates Directive  and the introduction of set-aside measures have stabilised pollution from nutrients and pesticides. This has reduced the environmental pressures on soil, water and air. [ 7 ]  Despite an overall decrease in nitrogen emissions from agriculture, nutrient levels still exceed nutrient critical loads in most of the EU. [ 8 ]  However, set-aside measures have now been abandoned as an EU policy instrument.   Agricultural nitrogen balances are declining but they are still high in some countries, particularly in lowland western Europe. Many water bodies, particularly in regions with intensive agriculture and high population density, suffer from  'diffuse pollution' (i.e. pollution caused by variety of activities which have no specific point of discharge). The resulting eutrophication can manifest in biodiversity loss, increase in algae and reduced oxygen levels. [ 6 ]    Figure 1: Common birds in Europe   population index         Despite progress in enacting and implementing European policies (such the Birds and Habitats Directives and the Water Framework Directive) as well as the  environmental measures within the framework of CAP  , Europe has experienced a major decline in biodiversity associated with agro-ecosystems and grasslands.   [ 1 ]   A recent reporting process on the conservation status of species and habitats under the  Habitats Directive  , showed that 63% of the assessments of habitats linked to grasslands are unfavourable. Only 11% of the conservation status assessments of species linked to grasslands is favourable.    Since 1990, common farmland birds have declined by 30% in Europe (Figure 1). This has been linked to increased specialisation and intensification as well as habitat loss. Between 1990 and 2011, populations of grassland butterflies declined by almost 50%, indicating a dramatic loss of grassland biodiversity (Figure 2).     Figure 2:Grassland butterfly indicator for Europe          Prospects   Sustainable farming, which reconciles low environmental impacts, food security, and the viability of rural societies, presents a significant challenge to  Europe's agriculture. In the context of European policies, the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 includes a specific target that addresses the role of agriculture and forestry as regards biodiversity in Europe and links directly with the reformed CAP and its greening measures. These will reward farmers for respecting three obligatory greening measures: maintenance of permanent grassland, ecological focus areas and crop diversification. [ 9 ]       'Greening'the CAP  is intended to slow down the decline in farmland biodiversity, most notably in intensive farming areas. These reform proposals can benefit the environment and biodiversity in particular. However, their positive effects will depend on the implementation of specific measures, not least because additional flexibility in implementation was granted to Member States and farmers in the final version of the legal texts.   Long-term food security can be supported by reducing  agriculture's ecological impact. This implies a fundamental shift towards more ecological approaches and an increase in resource efficiency. [ 2 ][ 6 ]  The strategy for selecting an optimal yield target rather than maximal may outweigh any short-term productivity loss. Plant and animal genetic resources for  food and agriculture  are also an essential part of the biological basis for world food security. [ 10 ]  Preservation of plant varieties and rearing of  endangered breeds  is crucial for that purpose. Farms looking to diversify crop and livestock production can support such a process. A transition towards more sustainable agro-ecosystems and increasing the  resource efficiency  of agriculture normally requires more advanced agronomic skills.   Europe has significant areas of High Nature Value farmland (HNV) (Map 1), which is characterised by a high proportion of semi-natural vegetation and low intensity agriculture, which, inter alia, supports rare species of European wildlife. Protecting HNV farmland areas is particularly important in this context, given the  ecosystem services  and public goods generated by the farming systems that maintain this land and the socio-economic pressures they face to intensify or abandon production. Clearly, the increased competition for land is expected to influence European agriculture. For example, the production of  renewable energy  and biofuels raises particular concerns related to the conversion of natural or semi-natural ecosystems, either for the production of biofuel feedstock themselves or for production of other crops that have been displaced by biofuels.The natural shifts in agriculture ecosystems induced by  climate change  bring further complexity in the management of farmland.      Map 1: Estimated High Nature Value farmland presence in Europe          Data sources:  Corine Land Cover 2006 seamless vector data  provided by European Environment Agency (EEA); Natura 2000 sites  provided by European Environment Agency (EEA).      High Nature Value farmland The concept of HNV farmland expresses the dependence of certain types of biodiversity on farming practises on certain types of land and the maintenance of specific farming systems. Typical examples of these systems include semi-natural grassland, traditional olive, vine and fruit production, and woodland/pasture. Dehesa and Montado are two well-known examples of the latter on the Iberian Peninsula.Three definitions of HNV farmland have been proposed. [ 11 ][ 12 ]      Type 1 - Farmland with a high proportion of semi-natural vegetation.   Type 2 - Farmland with a mosaic of low intensity agriculture and natural and structural elements, such as field margins, hedgerows, stone walls, patches of woodland or scrub etc.   Type 3 - Farmland supporting rare species or a high proportion of European or world wildlife populations.,Context Agriculture has shaped Europe'slandscapes for thousands of years and it still is one of the principle sectors impacting on Europe'senvironment.

"finland  Finland  country briefings    Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report      'State of the Environment in Finland 2013'  [1]  is a general report covering broad environment issues. It has eight main topics:      natural resources,   climate change and energy,   communities and transport,   air pollutants,   fresh water and the sea,   biodiversity,   chemicals and hazardous substances,   and green economy.       In parallel with this national report, the 13 regional Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment (ELY Centres) have published their own regional environment reviews.    Nearly every indicator in the report includes an assessment of both the long-term and the short-term trend as well as of the situation in relation to the targets.      The report is a response to the requirement  of the EU Directive on Public Access to Environmental Information. Data sources included environmental administration, several other authorities and research institutes.     Key findings of the State of Environment report     Many of the indicators show an improvement in  the state of the environment. Air and water pollution have clearly declined over recent decades. Trends earlier seen as irreversible, e.g. increases in private car use and energy consumption, are showing signs of leveling off.     However, serious problems like climate change and biodiversity loss remain unresolved. Despite deadlines aiming to halt the decline of biodiversity, the target has not been reached.Approximately one tenth of Finnish species were classified as threatened in 2010. More than one third of these are forest species. Nature reserves and wilderness areas cover some 9% of Finland's surface area, which is close to the international average.     Over the last hundred years, the average temperature has increased by approximately one degree in Finland. Warming has been most intense in spring time.           Emissions are decreasing, mainly as a consequence of advances in fuel technology and improvements in industrial processes and treatment technologies. A considerable share of Finland's economic growth in recent decades has been based on natural resources from overseas which explains the reduction in local impacts.     Due to better control, the sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions have declined by almost one half and by more than three quarters since 1990, respectively. Measures taken to reduce ammonia emissions have not been as effective. Emissions of compounds which form ozone in the troposphere have declined since 1990 but particle pollution has not declined. In general, days with poor air quality are rare in Finland.       Traffic volumes have increased  but most traffic-related emissions have clearly fallen since the early 1980s with the exception of carbon dioxide emissions which continued to grow until 2005. One factor slowing the decrease in emissions is that Finns are commuting longer distances: the average distance from home to work has increased by about 20% between 2000 and 2010 and doubled since 1985.       Discharges from industry and communities have reduced sharply since 1980 but r ivers still carry high quantities of nutrients. In addition, since the 1990s, the nutrient balance of cropland has declined in Finland, with the phosphorus balance in particular falling by up to one quarter from 1996 to 2011.     The ecological status of lakes and rivers in Northern Finland, and big lakes throughout the country, is mainly good or high. Many small lakes in Southern Finland suffer from eutrophication. High nutrient concentrations are also degrading the status of rivers. On the coast, the status of the Archipelago Sea and the Gulf of Finland is alarming. However, the status of the easternmost part of the Gulf of Finland has improved in recent years, thanks to water protection measures and more efficient wastewater treatment in St. Petersburg in particular.      In recent years the use of natural resources has been reduced by producing goodsand services using smaller amounts of resources with lower emissions. These increases in eco-efficiency have been most pronounced since the mid-1990s (Figure 1).    Figure 1. Trends in gross domestic product, total energy consumption, carbon dioxide emissions and total material requirement, 19752012          Source: Statistics Finland. 2013.    Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns    The key objectives of the  'National Energy and Climate Strategy' [2]   include ensuring that the national targets for 2020 are achieved and preparing a pathway towards meeting the long-term energy and climate objectives set by the EU. The new strategy entails a programme to reduce oil dependence. The long-term goal is a carbon-neutral society: the roadmap towards 2050 involves better energy-efficiency and the use of renewable energy.     The Strategy for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity in Finland for the period 20122020   [3]  has as the main goal to halt biodiversity loss in Finland by 2020. It stronglyemphasizeseconomic and cultural values related to biodiversity in decision-making concerning the use of natural resources. The strategy's five objectives focus on the mainstreaming of environmental issues across society, the introduction of new participants in the work to advance environmental causes, a decision-making process based on robust research data, and Finland's responsibility for the global environment. Particular attention is paid to sustainable use of natural resources. The Strategy is accompanied by an  Action Plan [4]  .     The revised Programme to Promote Sustainable Consumption and Production, ' More from Less  Wisely ' [5]    aims to reduce the environmental impacts and greenhouse gas emissions of households and the public sector. It proposes that the state and municipalities set an example by creating the preconditions for more-sustainable solutions. The programme promotes energy smart and comfortable living, high-quality food without waste, and smooth and environmentally friendly transport. In June 2013 the Government gave a  resolution [6]  on the basis of the programme, and also  a resolution     [7]       about promoting sustainable environmental and energy solutions (Cleantech) in the administration.     A ' Strategy for sustainable development' [8]   was published in 2006. It has been assessed since then and in 2012 the process resulted in a commitment:  'The Finland we want by 2050  Society's commitment to sustainable development' [9]  . The main objectives of the commitment are equal prospects for well-being, a participatory society for citizens, sustainable work, sustainable local communities, a carbon-neutral society, and an economy that is resource-wise.     The Finnish Government's resolution 'Programme for Implementation of River Basin Management Plans 20102015' [10]  in 2011   followed the approval of all the seven river basin management plans (RBMPs) in 2009. The aim is to improve considerably the ecological status of the waters. The Implementation Programme is based on the RBMPs and defines the national level priorities amongst the measures.     Finland's Marine Strategy [11]    reflects the importance of a good status of the Baltic Sea. The first phase of the marine strategy was addressed in a Government resolution [12]  in 2012  . There are now five marine  programmes and action plans [13] , [14]  .     The  Environmental Protection Act [15]   includes air quality. The  Air Quality Programme 2010 [16]   is the National Programme for the implementation of Directive 2001/81/EU on national ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants. The Programme defines the measures to reduce emissions e.g. from energy production, transport, agriculture, and industry.     The existing  Programmes and strategies [17]   related to land use and building address several environmental issues like energy efficiency, the transparency of land use planning, biodiversity and scenic values, ecosystem services and sustainable natural resources, cultural environment, environmental noise levels and traffic systems.        Country specific issues     The main issue in Finnish environmental policy in the next few decades will be the concept of carbon-neutrality. The goal of the Finnish government is an 8095 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This means eliminating more or less all emissions from the energy consumption.  An Energy and Climate roadmap 2050 [18]   to determine actions needed to meet this goal is under preparation.     At the same time, a number of municipalities in Finland are seeking for a faster timetable for achieving carbon-neutrality. Currently 19 municipalities have joined the  Carbon Neutral Municipalities project [19]  , and made a commitment to an 80% emission reduction by 2030.     A key question, when targeting carbon-neutrality, will be how to prevent the loss of biodiversity when the pressure on utilizing the country's forests and other renewable natural resources is expected toincrease.   In addition, topics like ecosystem services, green economy, resource efficiency, water quality, and urban environment will be essential also in the future.,Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report  'State of the Environment in Finland 2013'[1] is a general report covering broad environment issues.

Traffic volumes have increased but most traffic-related emissions have clearly fallen since the early 1980s with the exception of carbon dioxide emissions which continued to grow until 2005. One factor slowing the decrease in emissions is that Finns are commuting longer distances: the average distance from home to work has increased by about 20% between 2000 and 2010 and doubled since 1985. Discharges from industry and communities have reduced sharply since 1980 but rivers still carry high quantities of nutrients. In addition, since the 1990s, the nutrient balance of cropland has declined in Finland, with the phosphorus balance in particular falling by up to one quarter from 1996 to 2011. The ecological status of lakes and rivers in Northern Finland, and big lakes throughout the country, is mainly good or high. Many small lakes in Southern Finland suffer from eutrophication. High nutrient concentrations are also degrading the status of rivers. On the coast, the status of the Archipelago Sea and the Gulf of Finland is alarming. However, the status of the easternmost part of the Gulf of Finland has improved in recent years, thanks to water protection measures and more efficient wastewater treatment in St. Petersburg in particular. In recent years the use of natural resources has been reduced by producing goodsand services using smaller amounts of resources with lower emissions. These increases in eco-efficiency have been most pronounced since the mid-1990s (Figure 1). Figure 1. Trends in gross domestic product, total energy consumption, carbon dioxide emissions and total material requirement, 19752012  Source: Statistics Finland. 2013. Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns The key objectives of the 'National Energy and Climate Strategy'[2] include ensuring that the national targets for 2020 are achieved and preparing a pathway towards meeting the long-term energy and climate objectives set by the EU. The new strategy entails a programme to reduce oil dependence. The long-term goal is a carbon-neutral society: the roadmap towards 2050 involves better energy-efficiency and the use of renewable energy. The Strategy for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity in Finland for the period 20122020[3] has as the main goal to halt biodiversity loss in Finland by 2020. It stronglyemphasizeseconomic and cultural values related to biodiversity in decision-making concerning the use of natural resources. The strategy's five objectives focus on the mainstreaming of environmental issues across society, the introduction of new participants in the work to advance environmental causes, a decision-making process based on robust research data, and Finland's responsibility for the global environment. Particular attention is paid to sustainable use of natural resources. The Strategy is accompanied by an Action Plan[4]. The revised Programme to Promote Sustainable Consumption and Production, 'More from Less  Wisely'[5] aims to reduce the environmental impacts and greenhouse gas emissions of households and the public sector. It proposes that the state and municipalities set an example by creating the preconditions for more-sustainable solutions. The programme promotes energy smart and comfortable living, high-quality food without waste, and smooth and environmentally friendly transport. In June 2013 the Government gave a resolution[6]on the basis of the programme, and also a resolution[7] about promoting sustainable environmental and energy solutions (Cleantech) in the administration. A 'Strategy for sustainable development'[8] was published in 2006. It has been assessed since then and in 2012 the process resulted in a commitment: 'The Finland we want by 2050  Society's commitment to sustainable development'[9]. The main objectives of the commitment are equal prospects for well-being, a participatory society for citizens, sustainable work, sustainable local communities, a carbon-neutral society, and an economy that is resource-wise. The Finnish Government's resolution 'Programme for Implementation of River Basin Management Plans 20102015'[10] in 2011 followed the approval of all the seven river basin management plans (RBMPs) in 2009. The aim is to improve considerably the ecological status of the waters. The Implementation Programme is based on the RBMPs and defines the national level priorities amongst the measures. Finland's Marine Strategy[11] reflects the importance of a good status of the Baltic Sea. The first phase of the marine strategy was addressed in a Government resolution[12] in 2012. There are now five marine programmes and action plans[13],[14]. The Environmental Protection Act[15] includes air quality. The Air Quality Programme 2010[16] is the National Programme for the implementation of Directive 2001/81/EU on national ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants. The Programme defines the measures to reduce emissions e.g. from energy production, transport, agriculture, and industry. The existing Programmes and strategies[17] related to land use and building address several environmental issues like energy efficiency, the transparency of land use planning, biodiversity and scenic values, ecosystem services and sustainable natural resources, cultural environment, environmental noise levels and traffic systems.  Country specific issues The main issue in Finnish environmental policy in the next few decades will be the concept of carbon-neutrality. The goal of the Finnish government is an 8095 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This means eliminating more or less all emissions from the energy consumption. An Energy and Climate roadmap 2050[18] to determine actions needed to meet this goal is under preparation. At the same time, a number of municipalities in Finland are seeking for a faster timetable for achieving carbon-neutrality. Currently 19 municipalities have joined the Carbon Neutral Municipalities project[19], and made a commitment to an 80% emission reduction by 2030. A key question, when targeting carbon-neutrality, will be how to prevent the loss of biodiversity when the pressure on utilizing the country's forests and other renewable natural resources is expected toincrease. In addition, topics like ecosystem services, green economy, resource efficiency, water quality, and urban environment will be essential also in the future."
"agriculture  Agriculture  organic farming   sustainable farming common agricultural policy cap organic farming organic agriculture        Setting the scene    Agricultural production covers roughly half of Europe's land territory and is fundamental to food security. It is multifunctional, providing food, fibre and feed and playing a very important socio-economic role, particularly in rural communities. Europe has a high diversity of farming practices, growing conditions and agricultural ecosystems.  Agriculture  has substantial positive and negative impacts on  soils , air and  water quality ,  ecosystems  and  biodiversity , and landscape amenity value.   TheSOER 2015 briefing on  agriculture  provides an overview of the status, trends and prospects of agriculture in Europe and its effect on the environment. This SOER 2015 cross-country comparison focuses on organic farming.   Organic farming aims to be a more environmentally sustainable form of agricultural production, combining best environmental practices, and emphasising biodiversity protection and the preservation of natural resources. It also emphasises high animal welfare standards and the avoidance of synthetic chemical inputs such as fertilisers and pesticides and  genetically modified organisms (GMOs) .      About the indicator     The indicator is defined as the share of total utilised agricultural area (UAA) occupied by  organic farming  (existing organically-farmed areas and areas in the process of conversion). Farming is only considered to be organic at the European Union (EU) level if it complies with Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, which provides a comprehensive framework for production of crops and livestock; labelling, processing and marketing of organic products; and the import of organic products into the EU.     This indicator is regularly published by Eurostat and provides information on the degree to which adoption of organic farming practices has been occurring in European countries. This indicator is also included in the Resource Efficiency Scoreboard for the assessment of progress towards the objectives and targets of the Europe 2020 flagship initiative on  resource efficiency .      Policies, targets and progress   European agriculture has been supported for over 50 years under the  Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) , and while there are no policy targets for organic farming at European level, the recently adopted Action Plan [ 1 ]  and legislative proposal [ 2 ]  set out objectives for the development of organic production to 2020. The positive effects of organic farming on the environment will contribute to achieving a range of European [ 3 ]  and national policy objectives.      Many countries have adopted national policies for organic farming, with some containing quantitative targets such as increasing the percentage of land area under organic production, the number of organic producers, and the range of organic food products in public canteens.   While there has been rapid development of the organic sector in Europe in recent years, with an increase of around 500 000 hectares per year during the last decade, [ 4 ] in 2012 the total area under organic agriculture in the EU-28 was only 5.7% of the total UAA in Europe. [ 5 ] Most organic farmland is in countries that joined the EU before 2004 in which national and EU legislation have contributed to the development of the sector.   In absolute terms, the countries with the largest areas under organic production are Spain, Italy and France. However, the organic sector is quickly expanding in those countries that have joined the EU since 2004. These countries registered a 13% yearly growth rate in their organically farmed area from 2002 to 2011 and saw their number of holdings increase almost tenfold between 2003 and 2010. [ 4 ]    The relative share of organic farming within the total UAA gives an indication of the relative importance of the sector at national level. In 2012, the countries with the highest share of organic agriculture were Austria (18.6%), Sweden (15.8%) and Estonia (14.9%), and those with the lowest share were Malta (0.3%), Bulgaria (0.8%) and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (0.9%) (Figure 1).   Figure 1: Total organic crop area as a share of total utilised agricultural area in 31 European countries (2000, 2006 and 2012)        There is more than a 60-fold difference in the share of organic agriculture amongst countries, arising from a range of natural as well as historical, political, social, economic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include  climate , which influences the incidence of pests and therefore the need for  pesticides , along with the annual growing conditions and type of crops cultivated and livestock reared.   Historical developments explain part of the variation. For example, in Austria, the country with the highest share of organic agriculture, organic farming has a long history, with the first farms being established in the 1920s. Austria was one of the first countries worldwide to set official guidelines and it has a national policy framework and action plan for organic food and farming. In Bulgaria, a country with one of the lowest shares of organic agriculture, the first intensive activities to develop organic farming began in the 1990s with development of the local market for organic produce and adoption of a national action plan in the mid-2000s.      Organic agriculture in the West Balkans    Comparable time series data were not available for West Balkan countries, with the exception of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The share of organic farming in the West Balkan countries is very low, but increasing. Between 2006 and 2009 the share of total agricultural land utilised for this purpose in the region as a whole increased from 0.09% to 0.32%. Albania experienced the most rapid increase in the same period, reaching almost 2% in 2009.    The organic farming sector is currently under development in all countries, and new strategies and policies are being prepared or are under preparation. The 2009 figure could be compared with the approximately 0.5% share of organic farming in the EU-10 Member States at the end of the 1990s. [ 6 ]       There is large variation amongst countries in the growth of organic production. It has grown in the majority of countries, with Sweden, Czech Republic and Estonia showing the largest growth between 2006 and 2012. Only Portugal and Greece showed a reduction in share in the same period, with the United Kingdom showing no change (Figure 2).   Figure 2: Percentage change in the share of organic agriculture from 2006  2012 in 30 European countries         Prospects   Organic farming has been identified as a key element in sustainable management of Europe's natural land-based resources. [ 2 ] A transition towards innovative low-input systems, such as organic farming, integrated farming, precision farming, conservation agriculture and silvopastoralism (a combination of forestry and livestock grazing) can contribute to meeting the challenge of having a more sustainable food system. [ 7 ]    As well as a growth in the share of organic farming in most countries, there has also been a growth in the number of low-input farms in Europe, with such farms making up a higher percentage of area than high-input farms, although the latest available data are from 2007. [ 8 ][ 9 ]    The diversity of European agriculture and high number of countries that have adopted national action plans illustrate the potential for further growth in organic farming. This would contribute to increased efficiency in terms of nutrient management, reduce pesticide use, and reduce agriculture's impact on the environment and on biodiversity. The growing global demand for food, animal feed, fibre and  bioenergy  has implications for agriculture in European countries. A major challenge for organic farming is to expand and respond to demand without putting at risk consumers' confidence in the principles of organic farming and in the quality of organic products. [ 1 ]    At a European level, the Action Plan aims to respond to these challenges and focuses on the priority areas of increasing the competitiveness of organic producers; consolidating and increasing consumer confidence; and reinforcing the external dimension of the EU organic production scheme. Particular attention should be paid to the synergies between policies and instruments, in particular the  reformed CAP . It recommends that countries use opportunities and tools available in the new legal framework for rural development [ 10 ]  and the  Common Fisheries Policy  to support organic farming along with further use of public procurement requirements.   The CAP concerning the period 2014  2020, recognises organic farmers as 'green by definition' as they are automatically entitled to the green payment. [ 1 ] It enables specific agri-environment measures aimed at  climate change mitigation  and biodiversity conservation as well as organic farming practices to qualify for financial support from the rural development pillar (Pillar 2).   While these  CAP greening  measures are a step in the right direction, they do not seem to sufficiently address the resource efficiency of agriculture in terms of productivity, water use, carbon capture, and external inputs such as nutrients and pesticides. Nor do they sufficiently address the issue of ecosystem resilience .

"montenegro  Montenegro  country briefings     Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report     According to the Law on the Environment [1] , the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for preparation of environmental reports and contributions to international requests via the following publications:      National Information on SoE  annually, [2]      Indicator-based SOER  every four years. [3]       The Law on the Environment stipulates mandatory drafting of a SOER of Montenegro for a period of four years, based on the National List of Environmental Indicators which was adopted by the Government on March 2013. Consequently, the EPA published the first indicator-based SOER to present information to decision makers and the general public in Montenegro.   The report addresses the following themes and sectors:     air,   water,   climate change,   agriculture,   energy,   tourism,   transport,   fisheries,   waste,   biodiversity,   marine ecosystem.      The indicator's position in the internationally applied  DPSIR  model is specified.    An indicator-based SOER uses information and analysis from many years of implementation of monitoring programs for all segments of the environment (which are conducted by the institutions selected in the tender procedure), in addition to data obtained from relevant national institutions.    Key findings of the State of Environment report    During the period of sanctions (1990-1995), there was a significant drop in emissions of acidifying substances -primarily of SO X  and NO X  - due to the overall reduction in economic activities (primarily in energy production and transport intensity). After 1995, SO X  and NO X  emissions showed a steady upward trend. For the NO   X   emissions this stabilised for in   2009 (around the base value of 1990), while the SO  X   emissions trend remained unstable. This was probably a result of changes in the energy sector which was particularly pronounced in 2009; a decline was observed in SO  X   emissions by almost 50% compared to 2008. With intensifying energy production in 2010, emission levels suddenly increased. In the same reporting period - due to a drop in agricultural production - emissions of NH  3   showed a stable trend of slight decline, and in 2010 emissions amounted to about 50% of the 1990 levels.    Concerning the sectoral emissions of SO  X    and NO   X    during the period 2006-2010, there was  a trend of increasing participation of the energy sector in total emissions (SO  X   by 18%, NO  X   by 7%), a significant reduction in emissions from energy use in industry (SO  X  by 28%, NO  X   by 24%) and the share of transport (about 30% and about 15%). There was an increase of NO  X   emissions (about 15%) by public sector services, institutions and households.    Air quality in urban areas and nationwide assessed in terms of the concentration of SO 2 , NO 2  and O 3  is within the prescribed threshold limit value, with no major concentration variations on an annual basis. High concentrations of PM 10  and a large number of exceeded permitted daily concentrations (Figure 1) were most pronounced during the heating season, mainly due to the use of solid fuels (coal and wood).   Figure 1: Number of exceedances of daily limit values of PM 10  particles          Source:  Environment Protection Agency     Total consumption of ozone depleting substances (ODSs) was 37.22 t in 2006and 17.14 tin 2012. This represents a 54% decrease in the consumption of ODSs, mainly in the refrigeration sector. This results from National Program for the Elimination of ODSs (2007), but importantly, there is no domestic production of ODSs. Compared with the 105.6 t baseline consumption of ODSs (1995-1997), the decrease is 84%.   As a clear consequence of the crisis in the early 1990s, GHG emissions were reduced by over 50% in a five-year period. However, in 1998, emissions reached the same level as 1990, the baseline year. In the period 1998-2008, there was an evidently growing trend as a result of energy consumption in all energy sub-sectors except for industry activities. As a result of the global economic crisis, a new decline in industrial production and consumption of energy caused the decrease of GHG emissions in 2010 to a level of 22% below the baseline year emissions.   With regard to theWater Quality Index, in 2012 about 45% of the 13 monitored rivers were in the good quality category, 30% were very good and 25% were bad. Compared to the previous year, the average annual value of nitrate concentrations decreased in all streams with lower spatial imbalances. In contrast, the concentration of orthophosphate significantly varies spatially. In the period 2009-2012, there was a decrease in the concentration of BOD5 by 18% and a decline in concentration of NH 4  ions by 43%.   Organic productionis becoming more popular and economically important. Although in 2011 the area under organic farming covered 0.6% of the total agricultural land, in the period 2007-2011 the number of registered organic producers increased from 13 to 100.      In the period 2009-2012, the amount of generated municipal wastewas reduced by 39% while the GDP increased by 3.5%.   The national network of designated areas covers 9% of the national territory of which the largest part (7.8%) consists of 5 national parks. The remaining part covers more than 45 protected areas in the following categories: natural monument, an area of unique natural features and (general and specific) reserves. The planned target in the National Biodiversity Strategy is 10% of the terrestrial territory and 10% of the marine area.     Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns     Montenegro is in the process of EU integration with gradual adoption and implementation of EU legislation. Improvements in the field of air protection are connected with adoption of the following new legislation:     Law on air protection; [4]    Regulation on the limitation of emissions of air pollutants from stationary sources; [5]    Regulation on the establishment of a network of measurement points for monitoring air quality; [6]    Regulation on the types of pollutants, limit values and other air quality standards; [7]      all fully harmonized with EU legislation.   From 1 January2011, the use of motor gasoline with additives based on lead and regulate the sulfur content of liquid fuels of petroleum origin was prohibited under  the   Regulation on limit values of pollutants in liquid fuels of petroleum origin [8]   , i   n accordance with EU regulations.    The first National Strategy on Air Quality Management (2013-2016) [9]  has been adopted together with 54 measures in the Action plan framework. In accordance with national legislation (and EU directive 2008/50 EC), Air Quality Plans for two cities with the highest level of PM 10  concentrations exceedances have been adopted.   Efforts to create a national legal framework in the area of climate change is still ongoing. Concrete steps in implementing the Montreal Protocol, were made in 2007 with the adoption of the  National Program for the Elimination of Ozone Depleting Substances  and the  Plan for the Ultimate Elimination of CFC Substances  . The deadline for the final elimination of CFC substances (consumption or import) was on 1 January   2010. In addition, the purpose of the adoption of the Plan is to gradually eliminate the consumption of HCFC substances, especially in the service sector. The baseline period (from which the reduction of demand for HCFC substances is accounted for) is the period 2009-2010. [10]     Only 64% of all recommendations from the Water Framework Directive have been transferred into national legislation. The revision of theLaw on waters is ongoing.   The new National Strategy and National Plan on Waste Management (2014-2019) are drafted but still in the process of being adopted. The goal is harmonisation with Waste Framework Directive requirements for reuse and recycling, support to theStrategy on Energetic Development of Montenegrotill 2030, as well as support and inputs to the National Environmental Approximation Strategy  .     The ongoing process of updating the 2010 National Biodiversity Strategy (NBS)and the Action Plan(expected to be completed by the end of 2014) [11]  will enable full integration of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets into the national strategic framework and alignment with the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. The NBSand theNational Strategy for Sustainable Development established the objective of extending protected nature areas to 10% of the terrestrial territory and to protect 10% of the marine area. The first goal will be achieved in upcoming period with the proclamation of two new protected regional parks. With the purpose of achieving a higher level of harmonisation of national legislation with the Habitat and Birds Directive, the revision of the Law on nature protection was adopted at the end of 2013.     Country specific issues    The development of theCoastal Area Management Program (CAMP) [12]  for Montenegro is considered one of the most significant national success stories. This project was i  mplemented by the Mediterranean Action Plan - in the scope of UNEP and Montenegrin Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism - with the involvement of local governments from the project area and relevant institutions such as Environmental Protection Agency (from 2012).     Another important activity is the  assessment of general vulnerability based on the vulnerability of individual environmental segments. Existing pollution of individual environmental segments were analysed as a specific characteristic. Results of the assessment served as one of the baselines for defining spatial vulnerability and for identifying remediation measures. Vulnerability assessments or the determination of sensitivity/susceptibility of space is a method used to determine more vulnerable (unsuitable) spatial segments for the given (planned) intervention or activity. It represents an innovative tool for policy decision makers.    An assessment of general vulnerability is not an independent assessment per se  it is rather a baseline for preparation of the Coastal Area Spatial Planas well as for the Strategy and Plan for Integrated Coastal Zone Management., Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report  According to the Law on the Environment[1], the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for preparation of environmental reports and contributions to international requests via the following publications:  National Information on SoE  annually,[2] Indicator-based SOER  every four years.[3]  The Law on the Environment stipulates mandatory drafting of a SOER of Montenegro for a period of four years, based on the National List of Environmental Indicators which was adopted by the Government on March 2013.

The report addresses the following themes and sectors:  air, water, climate change, agriculture, energy, tourism, transport, fisheries, waste, biodiversity, marine ecosystem.  The indicator's position in the internationally applied DPSIR model is specified. An indicator-based SOER uses information and analysis from many years of implementation of monitoring programs for all segments of the environment (which are conducted by the institutions selected in the tender procedure), in addition to data obtained from relevant national institutions. Key findings of the State of Environment report During the period of sanctions (1990-1995), there was a significant drop in emissions of acidifying substances -primarily of SOX and NOX - due to the overall reduction in economic activities (primarily in energy production and transport intensity). After 1995, SOX and NOX emissions showed a steady upward trend. For theNOXemissions this stabilised for in 2009 (around the base value of 1990), while the SOX emissions trend remained unstable. This was probably a result of changes in the energy sector which was particularly pronounced in 2009; a decline was observed in SOX emissions by almost 50% compared to 2008. With intensifying energy production in 2010, emission levels suddenly increased. In the same reporting period - due to a drop in agricultural production - emissions of NH3 showed a stable trend of slight decline, and in 2010 emissions amounted to about 50% of the 1990 levels. Concerning the sectoral emissions ofSOXand NOX during the period 2006-2010, there wasa trend of increasing participation of the energy sector in total emissions (SOX by 18%, NOX by 7%), a significant reduction in emissions from energy use in industry (SOXby 28%, NOX by 24%) and the share of transport (about 30% and about 15%). There was an increase of NOX emissions (about 15%) by public sector services, institutions and households. Air quality in urban areas and nationwide assessed in terms of the concentration of SO2, NO2 and O3 is within the prescribed threshold limit value, with no major concentration variations on an annual basis. High concentrations of PM10 and a large number of exceeded permitted daily concentrations (Figure 1) were most pronounced during the heating season, mainly due to the use of solid fuels (coal and wood). Figure 1: Number of exceedances of daily limit values of PM10 particles   Source: Environment Protection Agency Total consumption of ozone depleting substances (ODSs) was 37.22 t in 2006and 17.14 tin 2012. This represents a 54% decrease in the consumption of ODSs, mainly in the refrigeration sector. This results from National Program for the Elimination of ODSs (2007), but importantly, there is no domestic production of ODSs. Compared with the 105.6 t baseline consumption of ODSs (1995-1997), the decrease is 84%. As a clear consequence of the crisis in the early 1990s, GHG emissions were reduced by over 50% in a five-year period. However, in 1998, emissions reached the same level as 1990, the baseline year. In the period 1998-2008, there was an evidently growing trend as a result of energy consumption in all energy sub-sectors except for industry activities. As a result of the global economic crisis, a new decline in industrial production and consumption of energy caused the decrease of GHG emissions in 2010 to a level of 22% below the baseline year emissions. With regard to theWater Quality Index, in 2012 about 45% of the 13 monitored rivers were in the good quality category, 30% were very good and 25% were bad. Compared to the previous year, the average annual value of nitrate concentrations decreased in all streams with lower spatial imbalances. In contrast, the concentration of orthophosphate significantly varies spatially. In the period 2009-2012, there was a decrease in the concentration of BOD5 by 18% and a decline in concentration of NH4 ions by 43%. Organic productionis becoming more popular and economically important. Although in 2011 the area under organic farming covered 0.6% of the total agricultural land, in the period 2007-2011 the number of registered organic producers increased from 13 to 100.  In the period 2009-2012, the amount of generated municipal wastewas reduced by 39% while the GDP increased by 3.5%. The national network of designated areas covers 9% of the national territory of which the largest part (7.8%) consists of 5 national parks. The remaining part covers more than 45 protected areas in the following categories: natural monument, an area of unique natural features and (general and specific) reserves. The planned target in the National Biodiversity Strategy is 10% of the terrestrial territory and 10% of the marine area.  Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns  Montenegro is in the process of EU integration with gradual adoption and implementation of EU legislation. Improvements in the field of air protection are connected with adoption of the following new legislation:  Law on air protection;[4] Regulation on the limitation of emissions of air pollutants from stationary sources;[5] Regulation on the establishment of a network of measurement points for monitoring air quality;[6] Regulation on the types of pollutants, limit values and other air quality standards;[7]  all fully harmonized with EU legislation. From 1 January2011, the use ofmotor gasoline with additives based on lead and regulate the sulfur content of liquid fuels of petroleum origin was prohibited undertheRegulation on limit values of pollutants in liquid fuels of petroleum origin[8], in accordance with EU regulations. The first National Strategy on Air Quality Management (2013-2016)[9] has been adopted together with 54 measures in the Action plan framework. In accordance with national legislation (and EU directive 2008/50 EC), Air Quality Plans for two cities with the highest level of PM10 concentrations exceedances have been adopted. Efforts to create a national legal framework in the area of climate change is still ongoing. Concrete steps in implementing the Montreal Protocol, were made in 2007 with the adoption of the National Program for the Elimination of Ozone Depleting Substancesand thePlan for the Ultimate Elimination of CFC Substances. The deadline for the final elimination of CFC substances (consumption or import) was on 1 January 2010. In addition, the purpose of the adoption of the Plan is to gradually eliminate the consumption of HCFC substances, especially in the service sector. The baseline period (from which the reduction of demand for HCFC substances is accounted for) is the period 2009-2010.[10] Only 64% of all recommendations from the Water Framework Directive have been transferred into national legislation. The revision of theLaw on waters is ongoing. The new National Strategy and National Plan on Waste Management (2014-2019) are drafted but still in the process of being adopted. The goal is harmonisation with Waste Framework Directive requirements for reuse and recycling, support to theStrategy on Energetic Development of Montenegrotill 2030, as well as support and inputs to theNational Environmental Approximation Strategy.  The ongoing process of updating the 2010 National Biodiversity Strategy (NBS)and the Action Plan(expected to be completed by the end of 2014)[11] will enable full integration of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets into the national strategic framework and alignment with the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. The NBSand theNational Strategy for Sustainable Developmentestablished the objective of extending protected nature areas to 10% of the terrestrial territory and to protect 10% of the marine area. The first goal will be achieved in upcoming period with the proclamation of two new protected regional parks. With the purpose of achieving a higher level of harmonisation of national legislation with the Habitat and Birds Directive, the revision of theLaw on nature protectionwas adopted at the end of 2013. Country specific issues The development of theCoastal Area Management Program(CAMP)[12] for Montenegro is considered one of the most significant national success stories. This project was implemented by theMediterranean Action Plan -in the scope of UNEP and Montenegrin Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism - with the involvement of local governments from the project area and relevant institutions such as Environmental Protection Agency (from 2012). Another important activity is theassessment of general vulnerability based on the vulnerability of individual environmental segments. Existing pollution of individual environmental segments were analysed as a specific characteristic. Results of the assessment served as one of the baselines for defining spatial vulnerability and for identifying remediation measures. Vulnerability assessments or the determination of sensitivity/susceptibility of space is a method used to determine more vulnerable (unsuitable) spatial segments for the given (planned) intervention or activity. It represents an innovative tool for policy decision makers. An assessment of general vulnerability is not an independent assessment per se  it is rather a baseline for preparation of the Coastal Area Spatial Planas well as for the Strategy and Plan for Integrated Coastal Zone Management."
"czech-republic  Czech Republic  country briefings    Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report    The State of the Environment Report (SoER) of the Czech Republic is a basic reporting document of the Czech Republic. The SoER is published annually on the basis of Act No. 123/1998 Coll., on the right to information on the environment, and on the Resolution of the Government No. 446 of the 17th of August 1994. The SoER has to be published within three months of receiving government approval. The methodology of the SoER is indicator-based. The indicators cover the following main environmental themes:     Atmosphere and Climate   Water management and water quality   Biodiversity   Forests   Soil and Landscape   Industry and Energy   Transportation   Waste and material flows   Financing     The set of indicators used is constantly being adapted to the needs of the Czech Republic's current national environmental policy, to the  EEA's core set of indicators , to environmental problems, and to the availability of the source data sets. CENIA, Czech Environmental Information Agency, is responsible for producing the SoER.    Key findings of the State of Environment report    The state of the environment in the Czech Republic is improving. There has been a long-term trend of decline in e missions of acidifying substances, ozone precursors, primary particles, secondary particulate precursors as well as greenhouse gas emissions from the manufacturing industry. Pollution of surface and groundwater has also been following a trend of long-term decline.      Air pollution is closely linked to developments in household heating, transport, the energy sector and the industrial sector. In the energy sector, electricity and heat generation from renewable energy sources has been growing, especially due to photovoltaic power stations as well as biogas stations. However, the generation of electricity in coal-fired power stations and associated environmental pollution is declining only very slowly.      Despite this decrease in emissions, emissions still cause acidification of ecosystems and agricultural land, and defoliation of forest stands. NO  x   emissions are also a precursor to ground-level ozone, which damages plants and reduces their resistance to stress factors of the environment.             Air quality in certain regions and localities still remains unsatisfactory. Household heating is a major, and difficult to regulate, source of emissions of PM10. It produces roughly 40% of particulate matter emissions. Main issues are obsolescence and low efficiency of combustion in heating units and to some extent behavioural traits of households.   There is still high pressure on the landscape connected with land-use development, particularly in large urban areas, and with the construction of transport infrastructure, which are both associated with allocation of agricultural and forest land resources for construction activities. This has increased landscape fragmentation and increased pressure on plant and animal habitats. As a result, migration patterns of animals are changing and there has been an overall decline in biodiversity.   The increasing extent of built-up areas also disrupts the ability of the landscape to retain water and protect against floods. Water retention in the landscape is essential for recharging water resources, which are important for drinking water supply and agriculture.   Positive developments include the decline in water consumption, and the improving quality of surface water. Although a growing share of wastewater is being treated, pollution from non-point sources  in particular agriculture  is growing.   The total waste production has had stagnating to slightly decreasing trend. Although landfilling still remains the main common method of municipal waste management, the trend is decreasing in favour of material and energy recovery.     Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns     The main policy responses are defined in the State Environmental Policy of the Czech Republic 20122020 [1] , which setsa framework for the effective protection of the environment in the following main areas:     Protection and sustainable use of resources   Climate protection and improvement of ambient air quality   Protection of nature and landscape   Safe environment     A large amount of financial resources and legislation effort has been spent in improving ambient air quality in locations where air quality limit values were being exceeded. The aim of this effort is to improve or maintain air quality and reduce emissions of the main polluting substances into the air, with an emphasis placed on the use of environmentally friendly energy generation and energy efficiency.   Nevertheless an increase in fuel and energy prices forced households to re-evaluate their heating methods and return to solid-fuel heating (brown coal and wood, but also municipal waste and fuels with worse quality). This shift led the government to offer financial support for the replacement of old boilers for environmentally-friendly boilers and also to offer financial support for people to install domestic insulation.   The Czech Republic has also given significant support [2,3]  to renewable energy in the last few years. This support has led to a growth in electricity generation from photovoltaic cells as well as from biomass. Construction of photovoltaic stations on agricultural land has changed land-use categories and led to the extensification of agricultural land. The financial support for biogas energy stations caused a risk for agriculture. Agricultural commodities (e.g. crops, rape) are now produced for energy use (biofuels or electric power made from biomass) instead of for human consumption.The support to the new RES has been adjusted accordingly.      Country specific issues   The Czech Republic pays particular attention to the elimination of air pollution because air quality has a direct impact on public health.   The main problems of air quality in the Czech Republic are benzo(a)pyrene (Figure 1), PM  2.5   ,  PM 10 , and surface ozone. Besides transport, the main sources of benzo(a)pyrene and PM 2.5   is residential fuel combustion. According to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute, 15% of households use solid fuels for heating. This percentage is declining only very slightly. As a consequence of this trend, local heating represents a significant source of primary particulate matter (PM), especially PM 2.5   , and produces over 80% of the Czech Republic's benzo(a)pyrene emissions. Air quality deteriorates considerably during the winter due to worse dispersion conditions.    In 2013, a number of towns and villages were assessed for benzo(a)pyrene concentrations. In 2013, the benzo(a)pyrenelimit value was exceeded in 17.3% of the territory of the Czech Republic (in 2012 it was exceeded in 26.5% of the territory of the Czech Republic). The percentage of inhabitants exposed to the above-the-limit benzo(a)pyrene concentrations in 2013 is estimated at 54.5% (in 2012 it was approximately 66.3%). The highest annual average concentration in 2013 was measured in the industrial locality Ostrava-Radvanice Z (9.4 ng.m -3 ). Above-the-limit concentrations are also reached in traffic localities as well as in the background urban and suburban locations (Czech Hydrometeorological Institute, 2014).   It is necessary to consider that estimates of annual average benzo(a)pyrene concentrations are highly uncertain due to insufficient density of measurement and an absence of measurements at rural air-quality monitoring stations. Further uncertainty is caused by the absence of measurements in small settlements in the Czech Republic. 48% of Czechs (Czech Statistical Office, 2013) live in small settlements (villages and towns of 10000 inhabitants or less), where the use of solid fuels for household heating represents a significant source of benzo(a)pyrene.

"cyprus  Cyprus  country briefings    Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report     The National State of the Environment Report (SoER) is prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Law on public access to environmental information (N. 119(I)/2004) and must include information on the quality of, and the pressures on, the environment. The following environmental themes are covered: atmospheric environment, climate change, water resources, marine and coastal environment, nature and biodiversity, land use, energy, waste, transport, and environmental noise. The indicators are determined on the basis of monitoring data and trend availability for each thematic area.  The 2015 SoER is currently under preparation.     Key findings of the State of Environment report    Climate Change    Cyprus is a country already experiencing climate change, especially through extensive droughts and the associated impacts on water supply, biodiversity and other sectors.     According to the latest inventory submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat   [1]          , the total national emissions of the country increased by 52% between 1990 and 2012          .      [2]           Since 2008, however, total emissions have been reducing by an average of 3% annually, primarily due to the financial situation of the country and the impact of the promotion of renewable energy sources (RES) (Figure 1). Energy remains the largest source of emissions (71%) of which 54% is from the production of electricity and 32% is from road transport.     Figure 1:   Total national GHG emissions by sector 1990-2012 (including LULUCF)           Source: Submission to theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat , 2014           Nature and Biodiversity      Cyprus designated 40 Sites of Community Interest (SCI) and 30 Special Protected Areas (SPA) for their inclusion in the Natura 2000 Network, in order to implement the Habitat Directive 92/43/EC and the Birds Directive 2009/147/EC.   Information regarding the conservation status of habitats and species in Cyprus can be found in the Report compiled according to Article 17 of the Habitats Directive.    [3]             Air Quality and Air Pollution      The Department of Labour Inspection operates a network of nine monitoring stations for the measurement of Ozone, Nitric Oxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Nitrogen Oxides, Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, BTEX, Particulate Matter (PM), and meteorological parameters and    four mini stations for the measurement of Ozone, Nitric Oxide, Nitrogen    Dioxide, Nitrogen Oxides and PM.    The measurement results are made available to the public together with other useful information on air quality through a dedicated air quality website.     [4]            The assessment of air quality measurements     shows an improvement of air quality in Cyprus (Figure 2).    Most of the air pollutants do not exceed the limits, with the exception of Ozone and PM   10   .        Figure 2: Annual averages of NO 2 , SO 2 , PM   10 ,  O   3 ,  CO  at Nicosia Traffic Station           Source:  Air quality in Cyprus      The Ozone exceedances of the 8-hour target value, observed mainly in non-urban areas, are primarily due to transboundary pollution and due to climate conditions prevailing in the Mediterranean area.       PM   10    exceeds both the annual and the daily limit value all over Cyprus. These exceedances are due to natural sources (sea salt), transboundary pollution (i.e. Sahara dust storms) and anthropogenic sources.          Regarding the emissions of different pollutants in Cyprus  ,   the main contributors are road transport, public electricity and heat production and industrial sources.     Energy   Targets:     Achieve an increase of 14.3% (463 ktoe) in  energy savings  in the projected primary energy consumption of the year 2020. Reached 12.3% in 2012 compared to 4.3% in 2011.       Increase of the contribution of RES to 13 % of the total energy consumption by the year 2020. Reached 7.7% in 2012 compared to 6.8% in 2010.     Waste    Due to very high consumption patterns Cyprus has one of the fastest rising waste generation rates. The environmental, health and socioeconomic impacts of the uncontrolled disposal of waste are also considerable given the size of the island. The reduction of waste generation rates and their management according to the wastehierarchyistherefore a priority.     Over the period 1996 to 2011 the total amount of municipal waste generated increased from 400.12 tons to 579.68 tonnes (by over 44.8%). Recent data shows that the growth rate of residual waste has been reduced however due to the increase in separate collection (mainly packaging and WEEE) and energy recovery.     Reducing waste generation remains a key priority for future waste management. In 2011 the per capita waste generation reached 683 kg/cap/y, one of the highest rates in EU.      Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns     Climate Change    The preparation of the national adaptation strategy is expected to conclude by the end of 2014. Concerning mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, until 2012 Cyprus was the only country in the European Union that did not have a commitment. However, in 2009 Cyprus committed to reduce non-ETS emissions by 5% by 2020 compared to 2005 through the Effort Sharing Decision. In 2013 Cyprus was included in the Annex I to the UNFCCC thus committing internationally to take action to reduce emissions.     Consistent with the Government's progressive approach to the development of national climate policy, the primary focus for securing compliance with EU law in the period to 2020 will be domestic mitigation.      Measures include the introduction of natural gas to Cyprus, primarily for use in electricity generation, increase of the Renewable Energy Sources' (RES) share to electricity, heating, cooling and transport, promotion of public transport and low emission vehicles and improvement of solid waste disposal sites etc.      An ad-hoc committee has been set up for the detailed revision of the policies and measures already in place, into a more detailed strategy for the reduction of GHG emissions.     Nature and Biodiversity     The most serious threats to nature and biodiversity in Cyprus are the effects of climate change, land use change, invasive species, illegal hunting, long drought periods and forest fires. Residential development, infrastructure, tourism and quarrying are among the most serious threats that ecosystems are facing today. Furthermore highway and rural road construction has led to habitat loss and a fragmentation of nature areas.      By 2014, most of the Natura 2000 areas will be designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) and Ministerial Decrees will be issued to ensure stricter protection and enforce new restrictions on anthropogenic activity within the areas.        Air Quality and Air Pollution     To address the anthropogenic contribution, Cyprus has prepared a National Action Plan    [5]            with specific measures to limit PM emissions.         For the reduction of air pollution in Cyprus, several measures have been established taking into consideration mainly the provisions of Directive 2010/75/EU in relation to emission limit values.     In 2009, Cyprus provided an update of the national critical load data. About 40.5% of the area of Cyprus is covered by forests and other (semi-) natural vegetation for which critical loads of acidity and nutrient nitrogen are computed.      Energy      The introduction of natural gas to the national energy system will be a major contributor to the energy efficiency target. Other measures include grant schemes for energy saving and domestic generation for RES in all sectors, measures focusing on road transport and the implementation of new EU policies.         Measures for increasing the contribution of RES to the gross final energy consumption by 2020 are ongoing. Currently, efforts focus on a pilot project announced by the Cyprus Energy Regulatory Authority (CERA) in 2012 for examining the effects of Net-metering.     Waste       According to legal requirements, the Department of Environment has prepared the   Waste Management Strategy, the   Waste management Plan for municipal waste and the Waste Prevention Program.        Country specific issues       The marine environment is of particular importance for Cyprus, both for environmental as well as economic reasons given the dependence of the island on tourism.     The status of the marine and coastal environment of Cyprus is evaluated from Good-High environmental ecological status, based on the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) and physico-chemical parameters, along with various monitoring programs such as the Med POL of UNEP/MAP and Impact Environmental Assessments.  Cyprus has completed the 1st phase of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.    [6]           According to the stock assessment results until 2010 the stock level of four of the most commercial fish species in Cyprus   was in 'over-fishing' status. The fishing mortality (F) for each species was greater than the fishing mortality threshold (F0.1).       Cyprus has established 6 marine Natura 2000 sites and implements monitoring programs under the EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) for species such as the Mediterranean Monk Seal and Marine Turtles, as well as for marine habitats such as the Posidonia meadows and sea caves. In addition, the mapping of Posidonia oceanica has also been implemented in all the marine Natura 2000 areas.         The implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive is a challenging task due to the limited human and economic resources. The effective management of the marine Natura 2000 areas as well as all the marine protected areas significantly contributes towards the objectives of maintaining good marine water status.,Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report The National State of the Environment Report (SoER) is prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Law on public access to environmental information (N. 119(I)/2004) and must include information on the quality of, and the pressures on, the environment.

Key findings of the State of Environment report Climate Change Cyprus is a country already experiencing climate change, especially through extensive droughts and the associated impacts on water supply, biodiversity and other sectors.  According to the latest inventory submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat[1], the total national emissions of the country increased by 52% between 1990 and 2012.[2] Since 2008, however, total emissions have been reducing by an average of 3% annually, primarily due to the financial situation of the country and the impact of the promotion of renewable energy sources (RES) (Figure 1). Energy remains the largest source of emissions (71%) of which 54% is from the production of electricity and 32% is from road transport. Figure 1: Total national GHG emissions by sector 1990-2012 (including LULUCF)  Source:Submission to theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat, 2014  Nature and Biodiversity Cyprus designated 40 Sites of Community Interest (SCI) and 30 Special Protected Areas (SPA) for their inclusion in the Natura 2000 Network, in order to implement the Habitat Directive 92/43/EC and the Birds Directive 2009/147/EC.Information regarding the conservation status of habitats and species in Cyprus can be found in the Report compiled according to Article 17 of the Habitats Directive.[3] Air Quality and Air Pollution The Department of Labour Inspection operates a network of nine monitoring stations for the measurement of Ozone, Nitric Oxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Nitrogen Oxides, Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, BTEX, Particulate Matter (PM), and meteorological parameters andfour mini stations for the measurement of Ozone, Nitric Oxide, NitrogenDioxide, Nitrogen Oxides and PM.The measurement results are made available to the public together with other useful information on air quality through a dedicated air quality website.[4] The assessment of air quality measurements shows an improvement of air quality in Cyprus (Figure 2).Most of the air pollutants do not exceed the limits, with the exception of Ozone and PM10.  Figure 2: Annual averages of NO2, SO2,PM10,O3,COat Nicosia Traffic Station  Source: Air quality in Cyprus The Ozone exceedances of the 8-hour target value, observed mainly in non-urban areas, are primarily due to transboundary pollution and due to climate conditions prevailing in the Mediterranean area.  PM10 exceeds both the annual and the daily limit value all over Cyprus. These exceedances are due to natural sources (sea salt), transboundary pollution (i.e. Sahara dust storms) and anthropogenic sources.  Regarding the emissions of different pollutants in Cyprus, the main contributors are road transport, public electricity and heat production and industrial sources. Energy Targets:  Achieve an increase of 14.3% (463 ktoe) in energy savings in the projected primary energy consumption of the year 2020. Reached 12.3% in 2012 compared to 4.3% in 2011.   Increase of the contribution of RES to 13 % of the total energy consumption by the year 2020. Reached 7.7% in 2012 compared to 6.8% in 2010.  Waste Due to very high consumption patterns Cyprus has one of the fastest rising waste generation rates. The environmental, health and socioeconomic impacts of the uncontrolled disposal of waste are also considerable given the size of the island. The reduction of waste generation rates and their management according to the wastehierarchyistherefore a priority. Over the period 1996 to 2011 the total amount of municipal waste generated increased from 400.12 tons to 579.68 tonnes (by over 44.8%). Recent data shows that the growth rate of residual waste has been reduced however due to the increase in separate collection (mainly packaging and WEEE) and energy recovery. Reducing waste generation remains a key priority for future waste management. In 2011 the per capita waste generation reached 683 kg/cap/y, one of the highest rates in EU.  Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns  Climate Change The preparation of the national adaptation strategy is expected to conclude by the end of 2014. Concerning mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, until 2012 Cyprus was the only country in the European Union that did not have a commitment. However, in 2009 Cyprus committed to reduce non-ETS emissions by 5% by 2020 compared to 2005 through the Effort Sharing Decision. In 2013 Cyprus was included in the Annex I to the UNFCCC thus committing internationally to take action to reduce emissions. Consistent with the Government's progressive approach to the development of national climate policy, the primary focus for securing compliance with EU law in the period to 2020 will be domestic mitigation.  Measures include the introduction of natural gas to Cyprus, primarily for use in electricity generation, increase of the Renewable Energy Sources' (RES) share to electricity, heating, cooling and transport, promotion of public transport and low emission vehicles and improvement of solid waste disposal sites etc.  An ad-hoc committee has been set up for the detailed revision of the policies and measures already in place, into a more detailed strategy for the reduction of GHG emissions. Nature and Biodiversity The most serious threats to nature and biodiversity in Cyprus are the effects of climate change, land use change, invasive species, illegal hunting, long drought periods and forest fires. Residential development, infrastructure, tourism and quarrying are among the most serious threats that ecosystems are facing today. Furthermore highway and rural road construction has led to habitat loss and a fragmentation of nature areas. By 2014, most of the Natura 2000 areas will be designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) and Ministerial Decrees will be issued to ensure stricter protection and enforce new restrictions on anthropogenic activity within the areas. Air Quality and Air Pollution To address the anthropogenic contribution, Cyprus has prepared a National Action Plan[5] with specific measures to limit PM emissions.  For the reduction of air pollution in Cyprus, several measures have been established taking into consideration mainly the provisions of Directive 2010/75/EU in relation to emission limit values. In 2009, Cyprus provided an update of the national critical load data. About 40.5% of the area of Cyprus is covered by forests and other (semi-) natural vegetation for which critical loads of acidity and nutrient nitrogen are computed.  Energy The introduction of natural gas to the national energy system will be a major contributor to the energy efficiency target. Other measures include grant schemes for energy saving and domestic generation for RES in all sectors, measures focusing on road transport and the implementation of new EU policies.  Measures for increasing the contribution of RES to the gross final energy consumption by 2020 are ongoing. Currently, efforts focus on a pilot project announced by the Cyprus Energy Regulatory Authority (CERA) in 2012 for examining the effects of Net-metering. Waste  According to legal requirements, the Department of Environment has prepared the Waste Management Strategy, the Waste management Plan for municipal waste and the Waste Prevention Program.  Country specific issues  The marine environment is of particular importance for Cyprus, both for environmental as well as economic reasons given the dependence of the island on tourism. The status of the marine and coastal environment of Cyprus is evaluated from Good-High environmental ecological status, based on the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) and physico-chemical parameters, along with various monitoring programs such as the Med POL of UNEP/MAP and Impact Environmental Assessments. Cyprus has completed the 1st phase of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.[6] According to the stock assessment results until 2010 the stock level of four of the most commercial fish species in Cyprus was in 'over-fishing' status. The fishing mortality (F) for each species was greater than the fishing mortality threshold (F0.1). Cyprus has established 6 marine Natura 2000 sites and implements monitoring programs under the EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) for species such as the Mediterranean Monk Seal and Marine Turtles, as well as for marine habitats such as the Posidonia meadows and sea caves. In addition, the mapping of Posidonia oceanica has also been implemented in all the marine Natura 2000 areas.  The implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive is a challenging task due to the limited human and economic resources. The effective management of the marine Natura 2000 areas as well as all the marine protected areas significantly contributes towards the objectives of maintaining good marine water status."
"transport  Transport  transport emissions vehicles health transport noise air pollutants socio-economy           Context    Transport is highly dependent on oil. 95% of all kilometres travelled (both passenger and freight) in the EU are powered by oil derived fuels ( TERM 2014 report ). [ 1 ]  The combustion of this oil releases pollution in the form of emissions, which place significant burdens on  human health and the environment . In 2012, the transport sector (including bunker fuels) accounted for 24.3% of total EU  GHG (greenhouse gas)  emissions.   Emissions of air pollutants from transport have generally declined over the past two decades. However, around 90% of  city dwellers in the European Union (EU) are still exposed to air pollutants at levels deemed harmful to health  by the World Health Organization (WHO), and transport is a large contributor to this. Transport also causes noise impacts.   Road traffic exposes more people to harmful levels of noise   than any other source, followed by rail and aircraft (see SOER 2015 briefing on   noise  ).  Data also show that fragmentation due to transport infrastructure and urban sprawl constitutes a   growing threat to many wildlife populations   via reduced connectivity among habitats, becoming increasingly isolated.    Transport demand, fuel consumption, and transport-related GHG emissions have all increased since 1990. They peaked around the beginning of the economic crisis and have shown unstable trends since.    EU measures to reduce transport emissions have included the introduction of fuel-quality standards and exhaust-emission limits for air pollutants and CO  2.   They have also included the incorporation of the transport sector into national emission-limit calculations for both air pollutants  [ 2 ]   and GHGs (under the EU Effort Sharing Decision).  [ 3 ]    The European Commission's White Paper on Transport [ 4 ]  is a further political response to these issues. It was designed to guide future policy developments in the transport sector over the next decade and in accordance with the long-term EU objective to reduce GHG emissions by 8095% by 2050. [ 5 ]  The White Paper calls for a reduction of CO 2  from transport of at least 60% by 2050 from 1990 levels. It envisages the target being met by a combination of new technology and more efficient use of existing technology.   Key trends   Transport demand   Transport volume growth and associated environmental pressures generally follow economic development (see Figure 1). International aviation has experienced the largest percentage increase in passenger kilometres from 1995 levels (+ 66%). Aviation in the EU showed annual increases of up to 7.5% until 2007, growing again by 10% between 2010 and 2011 and stabilising in 2012. Car travel has increased significantly in the last decades, but has remained below its 2009 peak in 2012. In recent decades, the growth in transport demand has often negated or limited many of the environmental benefits brought by improved technology.  Europe's challenge is therefore to achieve future economic development without increasing pressures on the environment.   Figure 1: EU transport demand by mode compared with GDP        Greenhouse gases   EU transport (including international aviation but excluding international maritime) GHG emissions are currently 20.5% above 1990 levels (Figure 2).  Transport is the only sector of the economy to have seen such a large increase in emissions in this period. Emissions from international aviation in the  EEA-33 countries  have more than doubled since 1990, while international maritime emissions increased by 34%, and road transport emissions increased by 20%. Rail transport and inland navigation are the modes of transport to have seen a decrease in GHG emissions compared to 1990, falling by 46% and 17% respectively in the EEA-33 compared to 2012.    Figure 2: EU transport emissions of greenhouse gases         On a more positive note, the transport sector shows progress towards the goal of achieving a 10% share of renewable energy by 2020 in each Member State. The average EU-28 share of renewable energy in transport increased from 3.4% in 2011 to 5.1% in 2012.   The use of renewable electricity in road transport has also increased, but remains marginal compared to the amount of biofuels consumed. Pure electric vehicles currently comprise only 0.04% of the total fleet and the latest data show that their share in EU-27 new car registrations is only 0.22%.   The efficiency of new cars has also improved, encouraged by EU regulations. [ 6 ] The average CO 2 emissions level of a new car sold in 2013 was 127 g of carbon dioxide per kilometre, significantly below the 2015 target of 130 g.However, manufacturers will have to keep reducing emissions levels to meet the target of 95g CO 2 /km by 2021.   Figure 3: Trend in emissions of air pollutants from transport (EEA-33)         Air pollutants    Unlike the trend for GHGs, emissions of the main air pollutants from transport have generally declined over the past two decades (Figure 3). However, the decreases for certain pollutants (SO x , NO x  and PM), are much less when emissions from international shipping are taken into account. The introduction of catalytic converters, progressively stricter Euro emission standards, and increasingly strict fuel quality standards are the main factors behind past reductions.   A less positive development is the increase in the fraction of NO x  emitted as NO 2  by diesel vehicles, leading to exceedances of NO 2  values in many European cities. Increasing traffic volumes, coupled with the promotion of diesel vehicles in many EU Member States, have thus become one of the main reasons why countries do not meet EU air quality regulations.   To make matters worse, NO x  emissions from diesel vehicles under real-world driving conditions often exceed the test-cycle limits specified in the Euro emission standards, a problem that also affects official fuel consumption and CO 2 -emission values. In general, an average diesel car emits more PM and NO X  than petrol, but less CO 2 . Recent data show that the CO 2  difference is decreasing.   Prospects   Before the economic crisis, Europeans were travelling more than ever before (see SOER 2015 briefing on tourism ). Based on past trends, the European  Commission's 60% transport GHG reduction target by 2050 will not be met. Meeting these targets will therefore require fundamental transitions in the European transport sector.   One of these transitions is the shift to alternative fuel vehicles. However, too few alternative fuel vehicles (electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen vehicles) are currently being sold. Consumers are reluctant to purchase these vehicles, and manufacturers are deterred from investing further in them. The European Commission has recently submitted a proposal to significantly develop the infrastructure for alternative fuels as a way of addressing the problem of low uptake of vehicles and lack of infrastructure. [ 7 ]  As well as delivering clear environmental benefits (reducing average CO 2  emissions and reducing air pollutant emissions etc.), the uptake of new technologies will also reduce  Europe's dependency on oil.   However, changes in the transport sector  such as renewing an entire country's fleet of vehicles  require time to take effect. Delivery of benefits from an uptake of new vehicle technologies also depends on developments in other sectors, such as clean electricity production to cope with increasing demand (while complying with the Emissions Trading System (ETS) agreements). Moreover, alternative fuel vehicles will not on their own solve other existing problems such as congestion levels, accidents and road safety, or noise levels. For this reason, additional fundamental changes in the way Europe transports passengers and goods are needed.   These additional changes include avoiding the use of transportation where possible; shifting necessary transport from environmentally harmful modes to more environmentally friendly modes; and improving the efficiency of all modes of transport. It is essential for the public to accept the need for these changes. Public acceptance is critical to overcoming the two main barriers for implementation of these changes: lack of political will and lack of funding. [ 8 ]     Fortunately, signs of a potential cultural change have already been identified in recent research. In countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan and the USA, car travel demand appears to be decreasing, remaining at the same level, or growing only slowly. [ 9 ][ 10 ][ 11 ] A number of reasons have been suggested for this change, including improved public transport, fuel prices, and changes in the symbolic value attached to vehicles. [ 12 ][ 11 ][ 13 ]    Aviation is another source of environmental pressures, and there has been extensive debate in recent years over whether international aviation should be included in the EU ETS. ICAO, the UN agency responsible for International Civil Aviation, recently agreed to develop by 2016 a global market-based mechanism to tackle emissions, to come into force in 2020. Nevertheless, the aviation sector remains exempt from fuel taxation, and ticket purchases are not subject to VAT, neither of which helps to address aviation transport demand.   In the longer-term, Europe will need a coordinated approach, which integrates all of the above policy measures: alternative-fuel vehicles, transport avoidance, shifting to less environmentally damaging modes of transport, new infrastructure, and financial measures. In order to gain public support, this coordinated approach must aim to address not just the environmental impacts of the transport system. It must also create better health and improved quality of life for  Europe's citizens.,Context Transport is highly dependent on oil. 95% of all kilometres travelled (both passenger and freight) in the EU are powered by oil derived fuels (TERM 2014 report).[1] The combustion of this oil releases pollution in the form of emissions, which place significant burdens on human health and the environment.

"albania  Albania  country briefings   Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment   The State of Environment Report (SoER) is prepared every year by the National Environmental Agency (NEA) and is a legal obligation [1][2] . The environmental indicators used in the Report are based on the data provided mainly by the monitoring of environmental indicators and from information and data provided basically by NEA and other public research and monitoring institutions at the national level.   The SoER [3]  shows the state of the main environmental indicators for air, water, biodiversity, soil, climate change, forests etc and is based mainly on theDriving Forces-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses ( DPSIR) framework. Indicators which can not be covered and monitored by the NEA are obtained from the following bodies:       Various ministries;     Other public institutions;     Research and scientific institutes contracted by NEA.      The publication of environmental monitoring data aims to raise public awareness on the state of environment at local and national level. It offers reliable information concerning critical issues, risks, and pressures, which should be under continuous monitoring and supervision.    Key findings of the State of Environment report    The SoER provides information on the state of the main environmental indicators, their trend by giving recommendations and proposing the necessary legislative measures and acts needed to be drafted by policymakers.    The monitoring of urban air quality is focused on indicators for: PM10, PM2.5, O 3 , NO 2 , SO 2 , CO and Benzene. Based on the data assessment from the period 2011 to 2013 in Tirana, a decrease of 20-30% has been observed at the concentration level of PM10 and PM2.5. This is due to improvements made in infrastructure and to several legislative measures undertaken regarding the standardization of used cars and vehicles. At the national level the concentration of CO and Benzene are at levels within the EU standards.   Groundwater monitoring is made on the main watershed basins for chemical parameters, NO 3 , NO 2 , NH 4 , HCO 3 , Cl, SO 4 , Na, Ca, Mg,K, Fe, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and hazardous substances. The level of chemical parameters monitored are within the allowed limits. Groundwater in Albania are classified as freshwater and have neutral and weakalkalinity , and strong average hardness. Content is within the maximum allowed values.    The quality of bathing water is focused on the main beaches of Albania for the following microbiological indexes: Enteroccoccus Intestinalis (IE), Coliform faecalis probably Eschericia Coli including sanitary inspection. The classification is based on the WHO/UNEP-UE criteria. According to the assessment made nearly 60% of the coastal bathing water stations in 2013 were classified within the A and B categories (A being excellent quality and B good quality).   Protected Areas (PA) are classified according to the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) categorization. The PAs have the greatest ecological, economic, cultural and natural heritage values of the country. Therefore their protection and preservation is of the uppermost importance.   One of the main priorities of the Government overrecent years has been the designation of new PAs. This has also been articulated in the National Strategy on Biodiversity [4] . In 2004 the total PA surface area was nearly 9% of the entire country, while in 2013 it covered 16% (Figure 1 shows the PA trend in hectares). The designation of new PAs has influenced biodiversity conservation and protection within and around these areas which in general seems to be well protected. In spite of the positive influence of the new PAs on biodiversity, at present they still face various problems and challenges:   a) habitat degradation from coastal erosion; b) illegal logging; c) illegal fishing, poultry and wild animals hunting; d) inefficient management of recreation activities.   These are critical issues where additional efforts should be addressed.   Figure 1. Trends in theincreaseof protected areas, 2004-2013       Continual monitoring of the state of forests [5]  takes place and is based on the CORINE classification. Albania is considered a country with high diversity of habitats and forest species. 40 habitats are identified as rare and endangered with the number of endangered species approaching 320. During the last two decades the total forest area decreased by 1.4%. This is due to changing land use categories in forest areas. It is directly related to the transformation and modification of forest lands. These are the basic problems caused by illegal logging, demographic movements, increase in the demand for wood and energy, overuse of forests resources, etc.   Waste management in Albania is decentralized. The responsibility for waste management goes to local government units. The trend of waste generation in total municipal, construction and demolition waste from 2009 to 2011 shows an increase, whereas during 2012 there was a decrease compared to the previous year. Meanwhile a slight increase in municipal waste, and a decrease in construction demolition waste during 2012 in comparison with 2011, was observed (see Figure 2). The new National Plan on Waste Management 2010-2015 [6]  envisages the treatment and management of waste on a regional basis involving the development of new landfills complying with EU standards.   There is still much work to be done to comply with the standards and requirements of the EU Directives on Waste.       Figure 2. Total waste generation, 2008-2012        Main policy responses to key environmental  challenges and concerns    Albania is working towards European Union integration and the fulfilment of obligations stipulated by the MSA (Stabilisation Association Agreement). In this regard environmental legislation is one of the top priorities. Efforts are being focused on transposing of the EU acquis and Directives concerning Air Quality, Water, Nature Protection and Biodiversity, Wastes, Climate Change, Noise, Chemicals etc.     A new law onenvironmental protection [7]  has been approved and entered into force in 2012. Its objective was to raise the level of environment protection by establishing a consolidated network of environmental institutions at national and regional level linked with environmental policy implementation.   During the period 2013 to 2014 the legislation concerning the Rules and Procedures on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environmental Permissions (EP) together with the relevant regulatory package have been drafted and approved [8] .   One of the priorities of the Albanian government has been to complete the legislation on Air Quality (AQ) in fully accordance with the EU Directive 2008/ 50/EC. The relevant national law was duly amended.    Progress was made in terms of drafting the legislation regarding the energy efficiency and renewable energy, based on the EU Directives 2001/77, 2003/54/EC, and 2003/55/EC.Accordingly the National Strategy for Energy (2007-2020) [9]  was updated.   A new 'Environmental Intersectorial Strategy (2013- 2020) [10] ' was recently drafted.The principal objective being sustainable development and protection of natural resources.   Attention is being paid to thecompletionof the legislation on the wastemanagement in Albania in accordance with the EU Directive on waste 2008/98/EC . The 'National Strategy and Action Plan for the Waste Management [11] ' and the law on 'Integrated Management of wastes in Albania [12] ' entered into force in 2012. Five regional action plans for waste management for the following regions: Tirana, Elbasan, Durres, Vlora, and Korca were approved.   Country specific issues   The SoER address the main environmental issues and challenges according to the priorities established by the government.   The 'Environmental Intersectorial Strategy 2013-2020 [10] ' is draft ended and is ready to be approved by the government.   With reference to climatechangemitigation, and the Second National Communication (SNC) for Albania, was highlighted that by 2025, the emission reduction by abatement scenario shall reach 48%. Mitigation measures proposed in SND includes all the main sectors such as industry, energy, services, transport, agricultural etc.    There has been an improvement in the quality of coastal bathing waters during recent years. This is due to investments made in the waste water treatment infrastructure. Until a few years ago the main source of pollution for coastal bathing waters has been the discharges of untreated waste water. However, investments made in some of the main cities have changed significantly the quality of bathing water.   One success story worthhighlightingis the completion of a national legal framework on the integrated management of waste in accordance with the EU Directive on waste. Much work is needed to fully implement this. In addition, raising public awareness and subsequent engagement in  related issues is also necessary as are more investments in building other landfills according to EU standards.      In general Albania has demonstrated progress on environmental issues, regarding the management of environmental problems but still too many efforts are needed especially for the implementation of the environmental legislation.,Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment The State of Environment Report (SoER) is prepared every year by the National Environmental Agency (NEA) and is a legal obligation[1][2]. The environmental indicators used in the Report are based on the data provided mainly by the monitoring of environmental indicators and from information and data provided basically by NEA and other public research and monitoring institutions at the national level. The SoER[3] shows the state of the main environmental indicators for air, water, biodiversity, soil, climate change, forests etc and is based mainly on theDriving Forces-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses (DPSIR) framework. Indicators which can not be covered and monitored by the NEA are obtained from the following bodies:  Various ministries; Other public institutions; Research and scientific institutes contracted by NEA.  The publication of environmental monitoring data aims to raise public awareness on the state of environment at local and national level. It offers reliable information concerning critical issues, risks, and pressures, which should be under continuous monitoring and supervision. Key findings of the State of Environment report The SoER provides information on the state of the main environmental indicators, their trend by giving recommendations and proposing the necessary legislative measures and acts needed to be drafted by policymakers.  The monitoring of urban air quality is focused on indicators for: PM10, PM2.5, O3, NO2, SO2, CO and Benzene. Based on the data assessment from the period 2011 to 2013 in Tirana, a decrease of 20-30% has been observed at the concentration level of PM10 and PM2.5. This is due to improvements made in infrastructure and to several legislative measures undertaken regarding the standardization of used cars and vehicles. At the national level the concentration of CO and Benzene are at levels within the EU standards. Groundwater monitoring is made on the main watershed basins for chemical parameters, NO3, NO2, NH4, HCO3, Cl, SO4, Na, Ca, Mg,K, Fe, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and hazardous substances. The level of chemical parameters monitored are within the allowed limits. Groundwater in Albania are classified as freshwater and have neutral and weakalkalinity, and strong average hardness. Content is within the maximum allowed values. The quality of bathing water is focused on the main beaches of Albania for the following microbiological indexes: Enteroccoccus Intestinalis (IE), Coliform faecalis probably Eschericia Coli including sanitary inspection. The classification is based on the WHO/UNEP-UE criteria. According to the assessment made nearly 60% of the coastal bathing water stations in 2013 were classified within the A and B categories (A being excellent quality and B good quality). Protected Areas (PA) are classified according to the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) categorization. The PAs have the greatest ecological, economic, cultural and natural heritage values of the country. Therefore their protection and preservation is of the uppermost importance. One of the main priorities of the Government overrecent years has been the designation of new PAs. This has also been articulated in the National Strategy on Biodiversity[4]. In 2004 the total PA surface area was nearly 9% of the entire country, while in 2013 it covered 16% (Figure 1 shows the PA trend in hectares). The designation of new PAs has influenced biodiversity conservation and protection within and around these areas which in general seems to be well protected. In spite of the positive influence of the new PAs on biodiversity, at present they still face various problems and challenges: a) habitat degradation from coastal erosion;b) illegal logging;c) illegal fishing, poultry and wild animals hunting;d) inefficient management of recreation activities. These are critical issues where additional efforts should be addressed. Figure 1. Trends in theincreaseof protected areas, 2004-2013  Continual monitoring of the state of forests[5] takes place and is based on the CORINE classification. Albania is considered a country with high diversity of habitats and forest species. 40 habitats are identified as rare and endangered with the number of endangered species approaching 320. During the last two decades the total forest area decreased by 1.4%. This is due to changing land use categories in forest areas. It is directly related to the transformation and modification of forest lands. These are the basic problems caused by illegal logging, demographic movements, increase in the demand for wood and energy, overuse of forests resources, etc. Waste management in Albania is decentralized. The responsibility for waste management goes to local government units. The trend of waste generation in total municipal, construction and demolition waste from 2009 to 2011 shows an increase, whereas during 2012 there was a decrease compared to the previous year. Meanwhile a slight increase in municipal waste, and a decrease in construction demolition waste during 2012 in comparison with 2011, was observed (see Figure 2). The new National Plan on Waste Management 2010-2015[6] envisages the treatment and management of waste on a regional basis involving the development of new landfills complying with EU standards. There is still much work to be done to comply with the standards and requirements of the EU Directives on Waste.  Figure 2. Total waste generation, 2008-2012  Main policy responses to keyenvironmentalchallenges and concerns Albania is working towards European Union integration and the fulfilment of obligations stipulated by the MSA (Stabilisation Association Agreement). In this regard environmental legislation is one of the top priorities. Efforts are being focused on transposing of the EU acquis and Directives concerning Air Quality, Water, Nature Protection and Biodiversity, Wastes, Climate Change, Noise, Chemicals etc. A new law onenvironmental protection[7] has been approved and entered into force in 2012. Its objective was to raise the level of environment protection by establishing a consolidated network of environmental institutions at national and regional level linked with environmental policy implementation. During the period 2013 to 2014 the legislation concerning the Rules and Procedures on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environmental Permissions (EP) together with the relevant regulatory package have been drafted and approved[8]. One of the priorities of the Albanian government has been to complete the legislation on Air Quality (AQ) in fully accordance with the EU Directive 2008/ 50/EC.The relevant national law was duly amended. Progress was made in terms of drafting the legislation regarding the energy efficiency and renewable energy, based on the EU Directives 2001/77, 2003/54/EC, and 2003/55/EC.Accordingly the National Strategy for Energy (2007-2020)[9] was updated. A new 'Environmental Intersectorial Strategy (2013- 2020)[10]' was recently drafted.The principal objective being sustainable development and protection of natural resources. Attention is being paid to thecompletionof the legislation on the wastemanagement in Albania in accordance with the EU Directive on waste 2008/98/EC . The 'National Strategy and Action Plan for the Waste Management[11]' and the law on 'Integrated Management of wastes in Albania[12]' entered into force in 2012. Five regional action plans for waste management for the following regions: Tirana, Elbasan, Durres, Vlora, and Korca were approved. Country specific issues The SoER address the main environmental issues and challenges according to the priorities established by the government. The 'Environmental Intersectorial Strategy 2013-2020[10]' is draft ended and is ready to be approved by the government.

"climate-change-mitigation  Mitigating climate change  greenhouse gas emissions   greenhouse gas emissions greenhouse gases emission trading kyoto protocol emissions reduction        Setting the scene     Climate change  is one of the greatest challenges of our generation. The warming of the climate system is happening with differing impacts and vulnerabilities for nature, the economy and human well-being across Europe.   In order to prevent the most severe impacts of climate change, countries (referred to as 'Parties') having signed up to the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC) agreed to limit the increase in global mean temperature relative to pre-industrial times to less than 2 C. In order to achieve this goal, countries need to take actions to reduce  greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions, known as mitigation actions, and at the same time respond to the occurring and projected impacts of climate change through adaptation actions.   The SOER 2015 briefing on  mitigating climate change  provides an overview of the status, trends and prospects at a European level, while adaption actions are described in theSOER 2015 briefing on  climate change impacts and adaptation . This SOER 2015 cross-country comparison focuses on trends in GHG emissions.      About the indicator     The indicator '  total greenhouse gas emission trends and projections  ' presents trends of anthropogenic GHG emissions in Europe between 1990 and 2013 and projected emissions between 2010 and 2030. It also assesses the progress of the EU, individual Member States and other EEA countries towards their GHG targets. The GHG emissions presented comprise the six GHGs weighted by their respective global warming potential and presented in CO 2 -equivalent units (see [1]  for details).     Emissions from international bunkers (international aviation and  maritime transport ) and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) are not included in total national GHG emissions.      Policies, targets and progress   European countries have a range of collective and individual targets under different policy processes. They joined the UNFCCC and ratified the  Kyoto Protocol  both as a whole (in the case of the first 15 EU Member States) and as individual parties. Under the Kyoto Protocol, they must achieve legally binding GHG limitation and emission reduction targets for the first and second commitment periods, 2008 to 2012 and 2013 to 2020 respectively.   To achieve their Kyoto targets, countries must keep their emissions within a certain budget by balancing emissions with the amount of Kyoto units determined by their target. Such a balance is primarily reached by limiting or reducing domestic emissions and enhancing carbon sinks through the contribution of activities, such as forest management. They can also increase their emission budgets through the use of flexible mechanisms whereby they can acquire Kyoto units from other countries. All EEA member countries except Cyprus, Malta and Turkey have Kyoto Protocol targets for the period 2008 to 2012.   The European Union (EU) aims to cut its GHG emissions by 8095% below 1990 levels by 2050 in the context of necessary reductions by developed countries as a group. The EU has adopted a target to reduce GHG emissions by 20% from 1990 levels by 2020. To achieve this target (one of the main targets under the Europe 2020 Strategy) a cap for the  EU Emissions Trading System  (ETS) was set at EU level, and individual national targets for emissions in sectors not covered by the ETS were set under the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD).   Many factors influence GHG emissions, such as changes in energy demand and fuel use, growth in particular economic sectors, increasing transport demand and shifts in transport modes, technological developments, low carbon energy sources, energy efficiency policies, and demographic changes.   The EEA has been publishing an annual  assessment of progress by European countries towards achieving their climate mitigation policy objectives . [ 2 ]  Climate and energy profiles  have been developed for each member country, providing information on key GHG data, total and sectoral GHG trends and projections, and progress towards the 2008  2012 Kyoto targets and annual Effort Sharing Decision targets (where applicable). [ 3 ]  The profiles also provide information on national targets, policies and measures. The  EEA greenhouse gas data viewer  provides easy access to data, and can show emission trends for the main sectors and allow for comparison between different countries and activities. [ 4 ]    In 2012, the EEA countries with the highest GHG emissions were Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy, and those with the smallest GHG emissions were Liechtenstein, Malta and Iceland. Total GHG emissions for the  EEA-33  declined by 14% between 1990 and 2012. However, national trends varied significantly, with GHG emissions declining in 22 countries and rising in 11 (Figure 1).    Figure 1: Percentage change in total greenhouse gas emissions in EEA countries (1990  2012)         The largest absolute reductions between 1990 and 2012 were recorded in Germany, the United Kingdom and Romania, with the largest increases recorded in Turkey, Spain and Portugal. The largest relative reductions were recorded in Latvia (58%), Lithuania (56%), Estonia and Romania (53%), with the largest relative increases recorded in Turkey (133%), Malta (58%) and Cyprus (52%).   In 2012, the countries with the highest per capita GHG emissions were Luxembourg, Estonia and Iceland, and those with the smallest were Latvia, Turkey and Romania (Figure 2). GHG emissions per capita for the EEA-33 declined by 22% between 1990 and 2012. However, national trends varied, with a decline in 26 countries, no change in 3, and a rise in 4. The largest reductions between 1990 and 2012 were recorded in Lithuania, Latvia and Romania, with the largest increases recorded in Turkey, Malta and Portugal.   Figure 2: Greenhouse gas emissions per capita in EEA countries (1990, 2000 and 2012)        Almost all European countries with an individual GHG limitation or reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol have already achieved their respective targets for the first commitment period 2008  2012, taking into account the contribution of carbon sink enhancing activities, such as forestry. The purchase of emission reduction credits will help 12 European countries reach their individual target (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland).   Prospects   EU Member States also have national annual targets for the period 2013 to 2020 under the ESD. Projected progress towards meeting the 2013 and 2020 targets is shown in Figure 3. This assessment is based on a comparison between the latest historic trends, relevant target paths (i.e. annual GHG emission targets 2013  2020 under the ESD), and projections reported by countries. A description of the data and methodology is provided in [ 2 ].     Figure 3: Progress towards 2013 and 2020 targets for EU Member States under the Effort Sharing Decision           The majority of Member States expect that their individual emission targets for the non-trading sectors (under the ESD) will be met through those policy measures already in place. However, for 13 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain), current projections indicate that 2020 emissions will not be below their respective 2020 targets. Further efforts to design, adopt and implement emission-reducing policies and measures are likely to be needed along with consideration of the use of flexibility mechanisms.    Achieving the 8095% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 will be challenging, and anticipated reductions by European countries are still largely insufficient when compared to the just adopted 40% reduction by 2030. These figures represent what is emitted within a country's territory, calculated according to international guidelines under the UNFCCC. Countries' contributions to global emissions could be greater if imports of goods and services and their embodied emissions are taken into account.   Climate change has the potential to further exacerbate a range of other environmental, economic and societal problems. Addressing this requires full implementation of existing policy instruments. In addition, there are gains to be made in taking an integrated approach to climate and other policy areas, and this is reflected in the many national debates on how to achieve the transition towards a low-carbon and  resource-efficient  future. Taking an integrated approach enables the identification of measures that provide an adequate response to the climate change challenge while also aiming to sustain  natural capital and ecosystem services .,Setting the scene Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our generation.

"bosnia-and-herzegovina  Bosnia and Herzegovina  country briefings   Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report    The Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Constitution states that jurisdiction in environmental issues is split between entities (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina - FBiH and Republika Srpska - RS), the district of Brko (BD), and at the cantonal/municipal level. The only institution at the state level with jurisdiction in environmental issues is the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations (  MoFTER)  .    Almost all environmental legislation operate at entity and BD level. All international agreements and projects are coordinated through the MoFTER.   Laws on environmental protection in the FBiH, the RS and the BD, as well as laws on water, are the founding legal acts that define and set out goals, principles, measures, responsibilities, documents, financing and supervision of environmental protection in BiH.    The 2012 State of the Environment Report (SOER) of BiH [1]    is the first one of its kind within the country. It is viewed as one of the founding documents on environmental protection in BiH.    Due to the lack of state level legislation governing environmental protection and thus providing a basis for the development of such a report, the 2012 SOER was made under the framework of the UN Joint Program 'Mainstreaming environmental governance: linking local and national action in BiH'.   The SOER re  presents a comprehensive overview of the state of the environment and trends, pressures and their effect on the environment, for the following topics:       Forest resources;     Land and Soil Resources;     Surface and Groundwater Resources;     Biological and Landscape Diversity;     Air Pollution and Ozone Depletion; and     Climate change.       Key findings of the State of Environment report     Forest cover is extended to 50% of the total territory of BiH. L  andmines are a potential threat to forests, causing certain areas to become unavailable for treatment and recovery efforts which aim to preserve the health of trees (e.g. protection from the bark beetle). Even though there are no data on illegal logging, there is a need to monitor the state and implementation of activities with the aim to prevent them.       Land and soil resources are also among the most significant natural resources in BiH, the primary function of which is the production of food and raw materials.  BiH covers an area of 5 112 879 hectares and close to 52% (2 600 000 ha) of the total land  area is suitable for agriculture. The remainder is considered forestland.           T  he division of agricultural  land per capita is 0.56 ha in the FBiH and 0.90 ha in the RS. When fertile land is  considered, the state in the FBiH declines further, to 0.23 ha per capita,  which is half the size compared to the RS (0.46 ha).    Wastewater treatment. In BiH, there is a clear problem of inadequate waste water discharge. Only some municipalities  in the Federation  and two in the RS  have functioning facilities for sewage water treatment.  In 2009, a positive  trend of increasing treatment quality continued, as evidenced by an increase in the share ofbiological treatment methods. Meanwhile, in 2010 there was a slight decrease.    Biodiversity and protected areas. The richness of the living world in BiH is a result of spatial and ecological heterogeneity, geomorphologic  and hydrological diversity, a specific geological past and climate diversity. The living world of  BiH is characterized by a high degree of endemic and relic forms of living organisms. More  than 5 000 species and sub-species of vascular plants, more than 100 species of fish, over  320 species of birds and other components of biological diversity have been identified in BiH. Different categories of protected areas in BiH are presented in Figure 1 below.    Figure 1: Categories of protected areas          Sour  ce  :  State of the Environment Report 2012 in Bosnia and Herzegovina      Air quality. Air quality in urban areas deteriorate during the winter period, due to emissions from stationary sources (small furnaces) and mobile sources (transport), combined with the location of cities in the valleys. Concentrations of SO 2  and PM 10  exceed limit values in winter period,accompaniedwith heavy smog.      Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Due to relatively low total energy generation and consumption, as well as low energy generation  and consumption per capita, BiH remains a small emitter of GHGs with a total of 24.14 Mt  CO  2   equivalents in 2005. Taking into account emission and   estimated population size of 3.85 million, as well as calculation of GAINS model (Greenhouse  Gas-Air pollution Interactions and Synergies), emission per capita in BiH for 2005 was 6.36  tons of CO 2  equivalent (UN Economic Commission for Europe, 2011).            Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns    Besides the legislation, enforcement regulations, rules and procedures, and international documents, a large number of strategic documents were adopted during the period 20002012, which present the basis of continuous BiH efforts to implement reforms in the environment sector:      the Solid Waste Management Strategy (2002);   the BiH National Environmental Action Plan  NEAP BiH (2003);   the UNECE EPR1  First Environmental Performance Review (2004);   the First National Report on the Implementation of UN Convention to Combat Desertification/ Land Degradation in BiH (2007) [2] ;   the Initial National Communication to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (2009) [3] ;    I, II, III and IV [4]  BiH report to UN Convention on Biological Diversity (2005-2010);    the Biological Diversity Strategy with Action Plan (2010);   the UNECE EPR2  Second Environmental Performance Review (2011) [5] ;   the NCSA Report (National Capacity Self-Assessment, 2012);   the Study on Energy Sector in BiH (2008) [6] ;   'BiH in the Process Rio + 20' - BiH report for the UN Convention on Sustainable Development (UNSDC) which was held in Rio de Janeiro on 20-22 June, 2012; and    the Second National Communication to the UNFCCC (2012) [7] .         Some important documents still need to be adopted, such as:     Water Policy in BiH;   National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan; and   enacting more legislation to be harmonized with the EU acquis.      Country specific issues    Environmental governance in BiH focuses on institutions atfour administrative levels: state, entity, cantonal and municipal. According to the Constitution,environmental policies and natural resource use are the responsibility of entity and BDgovernments which regulate environmental matters through laws, regulations and standards.   However, when the Law on Ministries and Other Bodies of Administration of BiH was adoptedin March 2003, the  MoFTER was given the powerto define policies and basic principles, coordinate activities and harmonize plans of the entitybodies, government and institutions. This is in accordance with international obligations in the areasof agriculture, energy, environmental protection, development and use of natural resourcesand tourism.   Even though such a complex administrative structure suffers from a lack of vertical (entity/canton/municipality) and horizontal (inter-entity/inter-ministerial/inter-municipality) cooperation,a shift forward in the environment sector reform implementation is evident.   The BiH accessionprocess to the EU is one of the main driving forces in the environment sector reform, which, for themost part, applies to the harmonization of domestic legislation with the acquis communautaire.      In the period 2002 to 2004, the FBiH,the RS and the BD adopteda set of environmental laws that are the basis for drafting subordinate legislation at all levels.Despite the accomplishments reached so far, certain areas are still unregulated by legislation.   Besides the adopted legislation, by-laws, regulations and procedures and ratification ofnumerous international agreements, during the period 2000 to 2012 a significant number ofstrategic documents were drafted, showing continuing efforts of BiH in achieving reform inthe environment sector.,Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report The Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Constitution states that jurisdiction in environmental issues is split between entities (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina - FBiH and Republika Srpska - RS), the district of Brko (BD), and at the cantonal/municipal level. The only institution at the state level with jurisdiction in environmental issues is the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations (MoFTER). Almost all environmental legislation operate at entity and BD level. All international agreements and projects are coordinated through the MoFTER. Laws on environmental protection in the FBiH, the RS and the BD, as well as laws on water, are the founding legal acts that define and set out goals, principles, measures, responsibilities, documents, financing and supervision of environmental protection in BiH. The 2012 State of the Environment Report (SOER) of BiH[1] is the first one of its kind within the country. It is viewed as one of the founding documents on environmental protection in BiH. Due to the lack of state level legislation governing environmental protection and thus providing a basis for the development of such a report, the 2012 SOER was made under the framework of the UN Joint Program 'Mainstreaming environmental governance: linking local and national action in BiH'. The SOERrepresents a comprehensive overview of the state of the environment and trends, pressures and their effect on the environment, for the following topics:  Forest resources; Land and Soil Resources; Surface and Groundwater Resources; Biological and Landscape Diversity; Air Pollution and Ozone Depletion; and Climate change.  Key findings of the State of Environment report Forest cover is extended to 50% of the total territory of BiH. Landmines are a potential threat to forests, causing certain areas to become unavailable for treatment and recovery efforts which aim to preserve the health of trees (e.g. protection from the bark beetle). Even though there are no data on illegal logging, there is a need to monitor the state and implementation of activities with the aim to prevent them. Land and soil resources are also among the most significant natural resources in BiH, the primary function of which is the production of food and raw materials.BiH covers an area of 5 112 879 hectares and close to 52% (2 600 000 ha) of the total landarea is suitable for agriculture. The remainder is considered forestland.  The division of agriculturalland per capita is 0.56 ha in the FBiH and 0.90 ha in the RS. When fertile land isconsidered, the state in the FBiH declines further, to 0.23 ha per capita,which is half the size compared to the RS (0.46 ha). Wastewater treatment.In BiH, there is a clear problem of inadequate waste water discharge. Only some municipalitiesin the Federationand two in the RShave functioning facilities for sewage water treatment.In 2009, a positivetrend of increasing treatment quality continued, as evidenced by an increase in the share ofbiological treatment methods. Meanwhile, in 2010 there was a slight decrease. Biodiversity and protected areas.The richness of the living world in BiH is a result of spatial and ecological heterogeneity, geomorphologicand hydrological diversity, a specific geological past and climate diversity. The living world ofBiH is characterized by a high degree of endemic and relic forms of living organisms. Morethan 5 000 species and sub-species of vascular plants, more than 100 species of fish, over320 species of birds and other components of biological diversity have been identified in BiH. Different categories of protected areas in BiH are presented in Figure 1 below. Figure 1: Categories of protected areas  Source: State of the Environment Report 2012 in Bosnia and Herzegovina Air quality.Air quality in urban areas deteriorate during the winter period, due to emissions from stationary sources (small furnaces) and mobile sources (transport), combined with the location of cities in the valleys. Concentrations of SO2 and PM10 exceed limit values in winter period,accompaniedwith heavy smog. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Due to relatively low total energy generation and consumption, as well as low energy generationand consumption per capita, BiH remains a small emitter of GHGs with a total of 24.14 MtCO2 equivalents in 2005. Taking into account emission and estimated population size of 3.85 million, as well as calculation of GAINS model (GreenhouseGas-Air pollution Interactions and Synergies), emission per capita in BiH for 2005 was 6.36tons of CO2 equivalent (UN Economic Commission for Europe, 2011).  Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns Besides the legislation, enforcement regulations, rules and procedures, and international documents, a large number of strategic documents were adopted during the period 20002012, which present the basis of continuous BiH efforts to implement reforms in the environment sector:  the Solid Waste Management Strategy (2002); the BiH National Environmental Action Plan  NEAP BiH (2003); the UNECE EPR1  First Environmental Performance Review (2004); the First National Report on the Implementation of UN Convention to Combat Desertification/ Land Degradation in BiH (2007)[2]; the Initial National Communication to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (2009)[3]; I, II, III and IV[4] BiH report to UN Convention on Biological Diversity (2005-2010); the Biological Diversity Strategy with Action Plan (2010); the UNECE EPR2  Second Environmental Performance Review (2011)[5]; the NCSA Report (National Capacity Self-Assessment, 2012); the Study on Energy Sector in BiH (2008)[6]; 'BiH in the Process Rio + 20' - BiH report for the UN Convention on Sustainable Development (UNSDC) which was held in Rio de Janeiro on 20-22 June, 2012; and the Second National Communication to the UNFCCC (2012)[7].   Some important documents still need to be adopted, such as:  Water Policy in BiH; National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan; and enacting more legislation to be harmonized with the EU acquis.  Country specific issues Environmental governance in BiH focuses on institutions atfour administrative levels: state, entity, cantonal and municipal. According to the Constitution,environmental policies and natural resource use are the responsibility of entity and BDgovernments which regulate environmental matters through laws, regulations and standards. However, when the Law on Ministries and Other Bodies of Administration of BiH was adoptedin March 2003, the MoFTERwas given the powerto define policies and basic principles, coordinate activities and harmonize plans of the entitybodies, government and institutions. This is in accordance with international obligations in the areasof agriculture, energy, environmental protection, development and use of natural resourcesand tourism. Even though such a complex administrative structure suffers from a lack of vertical (entity/canton/municipality) and horizontal (inter-entity/inter-ministerial/inter-municipality) cooperation,a shift forward in the environment sector reform implementation is evident. The BiH accessionprocess to the EU is one of the main driving forces in the environment sector reform, which, for themost part, applies to the harmonization of domestic legislation with the acquis communautaire.  In the period 2002 to 2004, the FBiH,the RS and the BD adopteda set of environmental laws that are the basis for drafting subordinate legislation at all levels.Despite the accomplishments reached so far, certain areas are still unregulated by legislation. Besides the adopted legislation, by-laws, regulations and procedures and ratification ofnumerous international agreements, during the period 2000 to 2012 a significant number ofstrategic documents were drafted, showing continuing efforts of BiH in achieving reform inthe environment sector.

"demography  Diverging global population trends (GMT 1)  global megatrends   Drivers    Fertility and mortality    The interaction of fertility and mortality rates  [1]  influences population size. By 20052010, the global fertility rate had declined to 2.5 and is expected to fall to 1.8 by 2050, other than in Africa where it is unlikely to fall below 3.0 before 2050. Mortality, including childhood mortality, rates have also decreased resulting in global average life expectancy rising to 69 in 20052010, with significant regional variations, and is expected to reach 75 by 20452050. [2]     Economic development    Research suggests strong links between fertility levels and economic development. As per person incomes rise, fertility tends to fall, and eventually reach, and then maintain, replacement levels.  Economic growth  also impacts migration patterns, as development discrepancies seem to be a driver of migration. [3][4]     Education    Education, especially of girls and women, is associated with lower fertility, better health and reduced levels of morbidity and disability. [5]  Lutz and Samir [6]  show how different levels of education could result in a difference in the global population of more than 1 billion by 2050 depending on whether the world follows a high- or low-education scenario.    Access to services    Access to nutrition, clean water, sanitation, and health services all reduce mortality, especially childhood mortality, and drive longevity  with health programmes targeting women's reproductive health playing a key role. Universal health coverage, however, remains a distant goal, while estimates suggest that more than 222 million women have an unmet need for modern contraception. [7][8]    Trends   Global growth   The world population has more than doubled since the 1960s, exceeding 7 billion in 2013. [2]  It will continue to grow, but at a slower rate, reaching 8.310.9 billion by 2050, with a medium variant [9]  of 9.6 billion [2] , depending on the policies pursued today. [10]       Virtually all growth is projected to occur in developing countries, and particularly their cities, with population in these countries rising from 5.9billion in 2013 to 8.2 billion in 2050, changing the global balance (Figure 1)  population in developed regions is likely to stagnate or grow slightly, mostly due to immigration (Figure 1).     Some regions, however, where the population is still growing are expected to move towards decline  it has already begun in the Caribbean, Japan, Russia and South America.  [2]       Figure 1: World Population Projections [2]            Source :   UN World population prospects: The 2012revision    Note:The population of Oceania (not shown), which represents less than 1% of the world population, rises five-fold over the period.      Changing age structures   Declining fertility levels, coupled with gains in life expectancy, are increasing the world's median age, which is expected to increase from 28 to 36 between 2010 and 2050, and raise the percentage of over 65s from 816 % of the global populationby 2050. [2]       Contrary to the aging population of developed regions, some developing-world countries are or will soon experience substantial youth bulges (Figures 2, 3). Providing educational and employment opportunities for these young people will be challenging, but critical if political and social stability is to be ensured.  [11]    Figure 2: Share of population under age 20 and over age 65 by regions in 2010, 2030 and 2050 [2]            Source :  UN World population prospects: The 2012revision     Shifting migration patterns   Since the 1960s, there has been a trend of migration from less developed to more developed regions. In 2010, however, the growth rate of the international migrant stock in developing countries surpassed that of developed countries for the first time. Several countries in developing regions (e.g. Kuwait, South Africa and Thailand) have been attracting significant numbers of migrants, including refugees from neighbouring countries. [12]  China, India and South America could attract more migrants as growth in their working-age population slows and wages rise. [11]    Although economic and social motives are still key drivers for migration, environmental degradation and  climate-change impacts  are becoming increasingly important due to increased exposure to natural hazards and the corresponding threats to livelihoods. [13][14]  In some instances, however, climate change impacts and environmental degradation can actually deter migration if communities lack the resources to meet the costs of relocating. [14]  Due to the high degree of complexity and uncertainty in calculations, projections for climate change-induced migration by 2050 vary from 25 million people to one billion people.  [15]    Implications   Environmental pressure   UNEP assesses population growth and patterns of production and consumption as the main drivers of environmental and land-use change. Population growth and related economic development boost humanity's use of and competition for non-renewable resources while escalating the consumption of biotic resources, the production of harmful emissions and waste, and the disruption or destruction of natural habitats (GMTs  8 ,  10 ). Environmental damage may become particularly significant in subSaharan Africa and parts of south-east Asia, where high population growth rates coincide with a direct dependency on natural capital  forests, fisheries, freshwater etc. [15][16]      In the longer term, changing patterns of consumption, in part driven by the development of a growing, increasingly affluent middle class in developing regions (GMTs  2 ,  5 ) are likely to boost unsustainable practices that erode essential and irreplaceable natural resources and increase pollution, processes which will undermine the very basis for economic growth and social progress. [17]    Economic impacts of expanding work-forces   Population trends directly influence economic activity, shaping the size and age structure of working populations (Figure 3). In many countries, strong growth in the working-age population, alongside improvements in health and education, and investment in infrastructure and technology, have contributed to rapid economic growth. [11][18]  The share of the population with secondary and tertiary education is projected to increase everywhere by 2050, particularly in Asia and Africa, potentially boosting further economic growth (Figure 3). China, for example, is expected to have more educated people of working age than Europe and North America combined by 2030. [19][20]  This trend is already apparent. While advanced economies dominated growth during the 20th century, emerging economies are rapidly gaining prominence, partly by providing a production centre for developed economies. Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa (BRIICS) accounted for 21 % of global output in 2000, 32% in 2010 and, according to projections, their economic production will exceed the  GDP  of  OECD  members by around 2030, and will account for 56% of global GDP by 2050.   [19]     Social cohesion   The world reached a peak in its share of 1524 year-olds around 1985, but in the least-developed countries it only occurred in 2005 and the proportion of young people will remain high in the coming decades with the largest youth bulges likely in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East (Figure 2). Failing to create employment opportunities for young people is both a waste of human resources and a source of potential conflict.  [11]       Policies supporting an increase in choices and opportunities, including the provision of contraceptive services, can support desirable population trends and mitigate negative effects in the future.  [7]   In developed countries, social cohesion is more likely to be threatened by an aging population and population decline (Figures 1, 2, 3). These may alleviate some of the demands on ecosystems, and the right policies could ensure that the growing number of older but active people provide an economic dividend.   [4]   Nevertheless, an aging population can threaten social security, taxation, and public health systems. Policy-makers will have to make difficult trade-offs, some of which can be mitigated by early action on structural reforms.  [19]    Immigration may alleviate some of these pressures by putting more people of working-age, often with higher education, into employment. It is estimated, for example, that 30 % of migrants in the OECD have tertiary education.  [21]   In developing regions, however, the emigration of highly skilled people is a major concern; for example one in nine tertiary-educated people born in Africa now resides in OECD countries.   [21]   Migration of young workers can, nonetheless, deliver economic benefits to their native countries; the World Bank estimates that remittance flows to developing countries in 2013 were nearly three times the size of official development assistance and will increase.   [22]       Figure 3: Population pyramids for Europe, Africa and Asia for 2000 and 2050 by age, sex and education attainment          Source:  Samir et al., 2010  [20]      Note: Projections for 2050 according to the Global Education Trend (GET) scenario. Back and forward projection methods are used to reconstruct populations by age, sex, and level of educational attainment. The back projections cover 1970-2000. The forward projections are for 2005-2050.      Implications for Europe   Europe's population is aging rapidly (Figure 2), and is likely to stagnate  significant increases in some Member States balancing declines in others. This may ease, though not curb, environmental pressures, but much depends on environmental policies to address such issues as  urban sprawl  and  production and consumption habits . One environmental concern is the decline of household size, which has accelerated since 1900. [23]      Furthermore, likely demographic trends will create other challenges  an expanded workforce during recent decades has underpinned improvements in living standards and the development of the welfare state. Sustaining these may be difficult in the light of population dynamics. [4]  EU Member States may be able to pre-empt some challenges, for example through integrated urban management or effective support structures for older populations. Nonetheless, keeping the global nature of environmental issues in mind, Europe should persist, both through its own policies and engagement in international dialogue on environmental issues, with efforts to decouple   natural resource use   and the production of pollution from economic development in the move towards a   green economy  .

"serbia  Serbia  country briefings     Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report     The Serbian Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) has a responsibility to prepare a national State of the Environment (SOE) [1]  report on a yearly basis. This is in accordance with Articles 76 and 77 of the Law on Environmental Protection [2] .This SOE report is one of the key documents in the field of environmental protection. Its role is to support decision makers as well as to provide environmental information to the scientific community and the general public. It also acts as an instrument for the direct application of Article 74 of the Constitution of Republic of Serbia [3]  which describes the right of citizens to live in healthy environment while being continuously informed about its state in a timely and comprehensive manner.    Serbian SOE reports are based on the indicators approach by applying theDriving Forces-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses (DPSIR) concept. Since 2006 reports have been produced on a yearly basis. The environmental topics presented in the report are grouped and organized in accordance with   National list of Environmental Indicators   [4] :      Air quality and climate change;   Water;   Nature and biodiversity;   Soil;   Waste;   Forestry, hunting and fisheries;   Sustainable use of renewable resources;   Economy and social potentials and activities;   Subjects of environmental protection system;   Implementation of national legislative in the field of environmental protection.     The overall quality of the SOE report has improved by increasing the amount and quality of collected data and information in support of updating existing and creating new environmental indicators.    Key findings of the State of Environment report     Air Quality  [5]   in urban agglomerations is characterized by polluting substances exceeding daily limit values. An increase in particulate matter (PM 10 ) and Nitrogen dioxide (NO  2  ) concentrations have been detected in urban areas  . An 'Appropriate Plan of Air Quality Management' has been prepared for  municipality of Bor due to high levels of sulfur dioxide (SO   2   )  . Pollen has been also observed and ragweed was again detected as a dominant allergen.    Air emissions indicators show a fluctuating trend for SO 2  and NO x  which occurred due to the decline in industrial production. An increase in NH 3  took place after 2005. The most significant contribution to the total quantity of emissions of these gases provides energy sector (NO x -57% and SO 2 -82%) and agriculture (92% forNH 3 ). Emissions of PM 10  are constant for the whole period and the most important sources are the energy sector (55%) and agriculture (29%). NMVOC emissions are constant for the entire period.      Surface and ground water quality monitoring, performed by the SEPA, shows that in most cases concentrations of BOD, ammonium ion, nitrates and orthophosphates remain within range defined as excellent or good ecological status (I and II class of water quality). The worst quality has been detected in surface waters (rivers and channels) in the province of Vojvodina because concentration of polluting substances of almost half of the samples are not within ranges prescribed for particular water bodies.   Regarding water emissions, the law states that sewage systems should be managed by public enterprises. Data indicates average connection rates to the sewage systems for 60% of inhabitants. A survey carried out in 2013 noted that 23 communities reported that they have access to an Urban Waste Water Treatment (UWWT)plant. In 2012, 67 Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) industrial facilities submitted data about wastewater discharging from 167 outlets. Eighty of them have some form of treatment - mechanical or biological. 54.76%of industrial facilities discharged their wastewater into the river and19.04% intocity sewer systems.   In the field ofwaste management indicators for municipal solid waste (MSW) generation shows that MSW increases, except in 2012. Total amount of generated MSW for 2012 was 2.62 million tonnes (0.36 t per capita). Average coverage of waste collection is around 70%. 21 MSW landfills sites are less than 100 m from watercourses and 5 of them are practically on the river banks. The total amount of industrial waste generated in Serbia in the 2012 was 8.2 million tonnes. The share of hazardous waste in this amount was 3%.    Biodiversity   [6]   and forestry issues have been also tackled in the SOE. One of the key progress indicators is the increase in the number of protected species. They increased to 1760 for species under strict protection and 868 under protection. More than 50% of strictly protected species are listed within international conventions and EU Directives. Forests cover around 32% of territory of Republic of Serbia therefore keeping forest exploitation within sustainable thresholds.   Soil quality monitoring has not been established at the state level. The main soil pollutants are Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), Nickel (Ni), Chromium (Ch) and Cobalt (Co). At the national level, there are about 384 localities comprising potentially contaminated (90%), contaminated (8%) and re-mediated sites (2%).   Results of the analysis of local soil pollution sources showed that the majority of sources come from public municipal waste dumps (43.5%) followed by locations used for exploitation and oil production (22.5%). Other important soil pollution sources are industrial waste dumps and industrial facilities. At the same time, examination of soil samples in proximity to 28 industrial facilities showed increased values of several elements.     Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns     Protected areas cover just 5.91% of total area, which is insufficient based on national targets of 12%  [7]  . During the period 1980-2006 average annual increase of protected areas was about 13000 ha. In 2007 and 2008 only 1083 ha were protected. From 2008 to 2012 the area of protected areas actually decreased by around 20 000 ha due to the correction applied at these areas.       Figure 1. Cumulative surface of different   prot  ected   areas           Source:  Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection     As a response to the need for establishing an integrated environmental monitoring during the period 2010-2014, efforts have been applied in increasing the scope of soil quality monitoring. This includes a systematic assessment of chemical pollution in urban areas and industrial zones. In 2010 a regulation [8]  was adopted creating a base for systematic soil quality monitoring and inventories of contaminated sites.    Policy in the energy field has been focused on increased use of renewable energy sources, implementation of programs for energy efficiency, cleaner development mechanisms and increased reliability of energy supply. Serbia has set its internal goal to increase the share of renewable energy sources in gross final energy consumption to 27% by the year 2020. Implementation of the first energy efficient action plan for the period 2010-2012 has achieved 81% of planned energy savings for this period.    Resource efficiency considerations are included in a number of key policies:  National Environmental Protection Programme  [9]  , National Strategy for Sustainable Use of Natural Resources and Goods [10] , Strategy of Energy Sector development till 2015 [11] , National CDM Strategy [12] .   Significant progress has been achieved in the field of economic instruments for environmental protection by adopting a set of laws in 2009 [13]  which define new environmental taxes thus increasing revenues. Such laws have also been applied at a local and regional level.    Country specific issues    Sustainable use of water resources requires specialized programmes for control and mitigation of drinking water losses in distribution systems. Such programmes should contain projects for distribution network recovery and increasing management efficiency. Namely, average water losses in public water supply systems were about 33% in 2012. The common characteristics of these systems with significant losses are limited water resources and a deficit in water supply.       There has been a decrease of 10-15% of the game animals during the last five years. This is an important indicator as regards forest and grassland ecosystem stability. The numbers of game animals have not increased despite an increase of 75% in the forest area in the last 50 years.    Systematic control of agricultural soil fertility indicates that the amount of organic carbon in arable land has decreased. More than 50 of soil samples have a low level (1.1-2%) of organic carbon while 12.8% of samples have a very low level (<1%). The sustainability of agricultural ecosystems in Serbia mostly depends on correct system management.   In order to increase energy efficiency, institutional decentralization has been initiated. In addition to the Ministry in charge of energy, six Regional Energy Efficiency Centers and the   Network of energy managers Serbia have been established. Efficient use of natural resources policy has been identified as a main driving force in the process of a transition towards green economy.   National legislation on air quality has defined and established a state network for monitoring of allergen pollen concentrations, a natural 'pollutant' impacting on the health of the population health., Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report  The Serbian Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) has a responsibility to prepare a national State of the Environment (SOE)[1] report on a yearly basis. This is in accordance with Articles 76 and 77 of the Law on Environmental Protection[2].This SOE report is one of the key documents in the field of environmental protection. Its role is to support decision makers as well as to provide environmental information to the scientific community and the general public. It also acts as an instrument for the direct application of Article 74 of the Constitution of Republic of Serbia[3] which describes the right of citizens to live in healthy environment while being continuously informed about its state in a timely and comprehensive manner. Serbian SOE reports are based on the indicators approach by applying theDriving Forces-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses (DPSIR) concept. Since 2006 reports have been produced on a yearly basis. The environmental topics presented in the report are grouped and organized in accordance with National list of Environmental Indicators[4]:  Air quality and climate change; Water; Nature and biodiversity; Soil; Waste; Forestry, hunting and fisheries; Sustainable use of renewable resources; Economy and social potentials and activities; Subjects of environmental protection system; Implementation of national legislative in the field of environmental protection.  The overall quality of the SOE report has improved by increasing the amount and quality of collected data and information in support of updating existing and creating new environmental indicators. Key findings of the State of Environment report Air Quality[5] in urban agglomerations is characterized by polluting substances exceeding daily limit values. An increase in particulate matter (PM10) and Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations have been detected in urban areas. An 'Appropriate Plan of Air Quality Management' has been prepared for municipality of Bor due to high levelsof sulfur dioxide (SO2). Pollen has been also observed and ragweed was again detected as a dominant allergen. Air emissions indicators show a fluctuating trend for SO2 and NOx which occurred due to the decline in industrial production. An increase in NH3 took place after 2005. The most significant contribution to the total quantity of emissions of these gases provides energy sector (NOx-57% and SO2-82%) and agriculture (92% forNH3). Emissions of PM10 are constant for the whole period and the most important sources are the energy sector (55%) and agriculture (29%). NMVOC emissions are constant for the entire period.  Surface and ground water quality monitoring, performed by the SEPA, shows that in most cases concentrations of BOD, ammonium ion, nitrates and orthophosphates remain within range defined as excellent or good ecological status (I and II class of water quality). The worst quality has been detected in surface waters (rivers and channels) in the province of Vojvodina because concentration of polluting substances of almost half of the samples are not within ranges prescribed for particular water bodies. Regarding water emissions, the law states that sewage systems should be managed by public enterprises. Data indicates average connection rates to the sewage systems for 60% of inhabitants. A survey carried out in 2013 noted that 23 communities reported that they have access to an Urban Waste Water Treatment (UWWT)plant. In 2012, 67 Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) industrial facilities submitted data about wastewater discharging from 167 outlets. Eighty of them have some form of treatment - mechanical or biological. 54.76%of industrial facilities discharged their wastewater into the river and19.04% intocity sewer systems. In the field ofwaste management indicators for municipal solid waste (MSW) generation shows that MSW increases, except in 2012. Total amount of generated MSW for 2012 was 2.62 million tonnes (0.36 t per capita). Average coverage of waste collection is around 70%. 21 MSW landfills sites are less than 100 m from watercourses and 5 of them are practically on the river banks. The total amount of industrial waste generated in Serbia in the 2012 was 8.2 million tonnes. The share of hazardous waste in this amount was 3%. Biodiversity[6] and forestry issues have been also tackled in the SOE. One of the key progress indicators is the increase in the number of protected species. They increased to 1760 for species under strict protection and 868 under protection. More than 50% of strictly protected species are listed within international conventions and EU Directives. Forests cover around 32% of territory of Republic of Serbia therefore keeping forest exploitation within sustainable thresholds. Soil quality monitoring has not been established at the state level. The main soil pollutants are Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), Nickel (Ni), Chromium (Ch) and Cobalt (Co). At the national level, there are about 384 localities comprising potentially contaminated (90%), contaminated (8%) and re-mediated sites (2%). Results of the analysis of local soil pollution sources showed that the majority of sources come from public municipal waste dumps (43.5%) followed by locations used for exploitation and oil production (22.5%). Other important soil pollution sources are industrial waste dumps and industrial facilities. At the same time, examination of soil samples in proximity to 28 industrial facilities showed increased values of several elements.  Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns  Protected areas cover just 5.91% of total area, which is insufficient based on national targets of 12%[7].

"climate-change-impacts-and-adaptation  Climate change impacts and adaptation  climate change impacts climate change adaptation adaptation strategies environmental themes adaptation policy processes       Context      Climate change  has already led to a wide range of  impacts on the environment , the economy, and society. [ 1 ][ 2 ] These impacts have been felt both in Europe and across the world. E ven if  greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions were to stop today, climate change would continue for many decades as a result of past emissions and the inertia of the climate system. [ 2 ]  It is therefore necessary to adapt to the changes that have already occurred and to prepare for plausible scenarios of future climate change.     To help promote this adaptation, the European Commission in 2013 adopted the communication 'An EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change'. [ 3 ]  The communication supports adaptation actions in countries, and promotesbetter research and information-sharing. It also supports ' mainstreaming ', the process whereby adaptation concerns are integrated into existing sectoral EU policies (like  agriculture  or regional development). Overall it  aims to help make Europe more  climate-resilient , enhancing its capacity to respond to the impacts of climate change at local, regional, national, and EU levels.     Adaptation is also considered in other EU initiatives, particularly Europe 2020 Europe's growth strategy, [ 4 ]   and the Resource-Efficient Europe flagship initiative. [ 5 ]   Moreover,  a new international climate change agreement is expected to be negotiated by the end of 2015. Several adaptation-related elements of such an agreement are currently being discussed. These include capacity building, institutional arrangements, financing, incentives for private investments, and provisions promoting transparency through monitoring, reporting and verification.   Key trends   Climate change impacts   Human influenceprimarily emissions of greenhouse gases, but also changes in land use has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. The last decade was the warmest since global temperature records became available.  Climate change impacts can be seen in accelerating  global sea-level rise  , in changes in various climate extremes and in changes in the global water cycle.  Precipitation  has generally increased in northern and north-western Europe, but has generally decreased in southern Europe. Snow cover in Europe has been decreasing, and the extent and volume of Arctic sea ice have been decreasing much faster than previously projected  [ 1 ][ 2 ]  (see SOER 2015 briefing on  the air and climate system  ;and on  climate change  ).      Observed climate change has already led to a wide range of impacts on environmental systems, economic sectors, and human health and well-being in Europe. These impacts vary across Europe depending on climatic, geographic and socio-economic conditions. Figure 1 shows key observed and projected impacts from climate change for the main biogeographical regions in Europe.   Figure 1:  Key observed and projected impacts from climate change for the main regions in Europe                Source:               EEA (2012)        Adaptation   These climate change impacts have spurred policymakers at national and European level to introduce adaptation policies that will help societies and economies to cope with the effects of climate change and socio-economic changes.    On a European level, 'mainstreaming' of climate change adaptation is taking place within various EU policies, such as freshwater and coastal management, biodiversity and nature protection, and disaster-risk reduction.  [ 6 ][ 7 ]    In order to assist the development of adaptation policies in Europe, the EU maintains a website, the European Climate Adaptation Platform ( Climate-ADAPT ). Climate-ADAPT enhances the sharing of up-to-date, reliable, and targeted information and data. Itsupports the development and implementation of adaptation policies across all levels of governance in Europe, for example by providing examples of adaptation options, case studies of implemented actions, and an adaptation-support tool.   On the national level   and at the city and regional levels   implementing adaptation is still at an early stage. [ 8 ][ 9 ]  Most progress has been reported for  freshwater management , flood-risk management, and  agriculture . The adaptation actions in these sectors have mostly consisted of 'mainstreaming' adaptation priorities into these national sectoral policy areas.   Although adaptation implementation is still at an early stage, adaptation planning work is underway in most countries. As of June 2014, 20 EEA member countries have adopted national adaptation strategies (13 more than in 2008). 17 of these countries have also developed an adaptation national action plan to help further define the adaptation actions they will implement. [ 7 ]    Most European countries report that the level of public awareness regarding the need for adaptation has increased during the past five years and that adaptation has reached the national political agenda.   On a transnational level, adaptation action is mainly the result of shared natural resources such as transboundary water catchments. Transnational cooperation of this sort is often supported by European funding instruments (e.g. in the Baltic Sea region) and through European regional conventions (e.g. the Danube Commission).     Prospects   Climate change impacts    In the long term, the magnitude and rate of climate change depends on future global greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union is committed to limiting global temperature increase to below 2 C above the pre-industrial level, as agreed globally under the  UNFCCC . However, the projected rise in global average temperatures over the 21  st  century is0.3 C1.7 C for the lowest emission scenario, and 2.6 C4.8 C for the highest emission scenario  . [ 2 ]       Figure 2:  Projected changes in annual mean temperature (left) and annual precipitation (right)             Source: Climate change projections for Europe based on an ensemble of regional climate model simulations provided by the EURO-CORDEX initiative .   Note: Projected changes are for 2071-2100, compared to 1971-2000, based on the average of a multi-model ensemble forced with the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 high emissions scenario. All changes marked with a colour (i.e. not white) are statistically significant.Individual models from the EURO-CORDEX ensemble or high-resolution models for smaller regions may show different results.   Indicators: Global and European temperature (CSI 012) , Mean precipitation (CLIM 002) .     Annual average land temperatures over Europe are projected to continue increasing by more than the global average temperature. The largest temperature increases are projected over eastern and northern Europe in winter, and over southern Europe in summer. Annual precipitation is generally projected to increase in northern Europe and to decrease in southern Europe, thereby enhancing the differences between currently wet regions and currently dry regions(Figure 2). The intensity and frequency of extreme weather events is also projected to increase in many regions, and sea-level rise is projected to accelerate significantly.   [ 1 ]       Climate change may increase existing vulnerabilities and deepen socio-economic inbalances in Europe. Major climate risks for Europe include increased coastal and river floods, significant reduction in water availability, and extreme heat events.  [ 10 ]     According to a recent study, under a high-emission scenario and in the absence of adaptation actions, some climate impacts would roughly double by the end of this century. Heat-related deaths would reach about 200 000 per year; the cost of river flood damages would exceed EUR 10 billion/year; and every year forest fires would affect an area about 800 000 ha. In this scenario, p  eople affected by droughts would also increase by a factor of seven to about 150 million per year, and welfare loss due to sea-level rise would more than triple to EUR 42 billion/year. [ 11 ]       Adaptation    Adaptation policy at the European level will receive new financial resources in the coming years. 20% of the EU budget for 2014  2020 will be used for climate-related actions (i.e. adaptation and climate-change mitigation). This funding will be disbursed to Member-State level through a range of EU funds such as theEuropean Regional Development and Cohesion Funds, European Structural and Investment funds,LIFE+ projects, and the INTERREGregional cooperation funds. [ 12 ][ 7 ]        In 2017, the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the state  of implementation of the 2013 communication 'An EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change', and will propose its review if needed.     Assessment processes are also in place at national level, and will lead to better knowledge in the future about effective adaptation. Four European countries are currently implementing a monitoring, reporting or evaluation scheme. Nine countries have already developed   or are developing   indicators on climate change impacts, risks or adaptation.     Climate change risk or vulnerability assessments are available for 21 European countries, but more information is still needed, particularly on the estimated benefits and costs of different adaptation options. Another area that requires more research is the issue of how best to craft adaptation responses in the light of uncertainty concerning future climate change impacts, societal change, and the effectiveness of adaptation responses.,Context Climate change has already led to a wide range of impacts on the environment, the economy, and society.[1][2]These impacts have been felt both in Europe and across the world.

"slovenia  Slovenia  country briefings     Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report      Slovenia's Environmental Indicator Report 2014 [1]   is the latest national report on the country's environmental issues and is also the basis for the State of Environment report [3] , which is due to be published in 2015 according to the Environmental Protection Act [4] .   The most relevant indicators in the report are summarised in the web-based system Environmental indicators in Slovenia [2]  , which is continuously updated.   The report is based on the DPSIR framework, taking into consideration the economic, social and environmental perspective. Every chapter has a summary in which the basic facts are presented along with an indication on how the environmental issues are interlinked. Every indicator has a short key message, trend-assessment sign, graph, description of the topic, and link to the relevant indicators in the system.   The main themes are Air quality and Climate change, Water, Land and Nature, Natural resources and Waste, supplemented by Health, Transport, Energy, Agriculture and some other indicators related to environment.    Key findings of the State of Environment report    Air quality   Figure 1: Exposure of 0-15 year old children to PM 10  concentrations in the ambient air        Note: The PM 10  WHO air quality guideline for the annual mean is 20 g/m 3 , while the EU limit value is set to 40 g/m  3   .      Source: Database on hospital treatments, National Institute of Public Health, 2013; Automatic Air Quality Measurement Database (DMKZ), Slovenian Environment Agency, 2013.       Road traffic and domestic heating using wood in outdated appliances followed by power generation, industry, and agriculture are the main sources of air pollution. Particulate matter and ozoneare the major environmental and health problem. Recent health studies have confirmed links between air pollution from particulate matter PM 10  and the development of asthma in children. Children in Slovenia (0-15 years of age) are on average exposed to PM 10  annual concentrations of 3040 g/m 3 , which is above the level recommended by the WHO (Fig. 1). Measures to improve the air quality are aimed at enhancing efficiency in the transport and energy (including buildings) sectors.   Freight and passenger transport volumes are increasing. Emissions from the road transit traffic are causing most concern. As Slovenia is located at the crossroad of the fifth and tenth corridor, between SE and W Europe a lot of goods are passing through Slovenia. Increase was significant after Romania and Croatia became an EU member.   Climate change   The average annual temperature increase in Slovenia is greater than the global average. A cause for even greater concern is the change in seasonal precipitation patterns. The number of hot days is increasing, and the precipitation regime is changing. This may cause the Triglav glacier to completely disappear in the next few years.   In Slovenia, the use of fossil fuels in the energy sector, households, industry and transport accounts for more than threequarters of all greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to climate change mitigation, adaptation to changing climate is also necessary.   Water   Slovenia is rich in water, but water resources are vulnerable and distributed unevenly. Slovenia uses only a small portion of available water run-off for human use (about 3%). Approximately 15 billion m 3  of water flows out of Slovenia through rivers every year, but long-term trends show that this volume is falling. Because of the country's headwater position and the torrential character of the majority of water courses, the flow rate varies greatly during the year, with alack of water in the vegetative period and large quantities of water - or even floods- during the other periods of the year. The annual groundwater recharge also varies considerably.     Figure 2: Chemical status of groundwater bodies in 2012           Groundwater is the main source of drinking water in Slovenia.Most groundwater bodies had a good chemical status in 2012 (Fig. 2). Water protection areas cover 17% of Slovenia's land area, and nearly one third of these water protection areas is agricultural land. The intensity of agricultural production in Slovenia has been moderately increasing in the last two decades. However, the excess of nitrogen from fertilisers and the use of phytopharmaceuticals have been declining in last decade. The percentage of people whose waste water is treated in municipal waste-water treatment plants has increased considerably, but it is still only 55%. The majority of surface water bodies have good chemical status and slightly more than half also have good ecological status.   Land and nature   Diverse land cover, and land use with interweaving forest, agricultural and built-up areas are characteristic of Slovenia. Forests cover more than one half of the surface area, and built-up areas slightly less than 3%, according to CORINE Land Cover data. However, the share of built-up areas has been constantly increasing.   Slovenia's biotic wealth is reflected in the habitat types and species of European importance.  Natura 2000  sites amount to 7 683 km 2  or 37.9% of Slovenia's land area. Nearly half of Slovenia's habitat types and 28% of its species have favorable conservation status.   The effective management of nationally protected areas (such as national, regional and landscape parks, covering 13% of the territory) and valuable natural features, including11,138 underground caves, can facilitate the conservation of species and habitats.   Forests have a special place in the biotic wealth of Slovenia. The share of forests with conserved natural tree composition exceeds 50% of all the country's forests, indicating resilience and sustainable management.   Natural resources and waste    The exploitation of natural resourcesgenerated or extracted in Slovenia has declined since 2007. 22 million tonnes were exploited in 2012, of which the vast majority were mineral resources used in the construction industry. Imported materials and goods also declined after 2008. Domestic material consumption per capita was 12.4 tonnes in 2012. Material productivity has been rising since 2007.   The largest quantity of waste is generated from production and service activities (3.7 million tonnes in 2012). Since 2002, 60% of such waste has been recovered, and recovery rates continue to grow. In 2012, 672 000 tonnes of municipal waste were generated (327 kg per capita). Thanks to separate waste collection and other legal measures, the quantity of landfilled municipal waste has declined (from 74% in 2008 to 47% in 2012).   Extended producer responsibility started to be introduced in most sectors in 2004 (packaging waste, end of life vehicles, waste medicinal products). The recycling rates of the collected waste in general meet current targets, but the collection rates themselves need to be improved.     Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns     Air quality plans for specific areas [5]  - seven air quality plans for the country's municipalities have been prepared in partnership with the municipalities, which gives a good prospect for successful implementation.   Climate Change: an action plan for decreasing GHG emissions is being prepared.  A risk assessment of natural and other disasters  that pose the greatest risk at the national level will be prepared.  Completing theconstruction of a complex-weather radar  (in addition to the existing one) is crucial for short-term forecasting of extreme weather events.          Water: An operational programme for drinking water supply will be prepared. It will also address the problem of water loss from the public water supply, which currently runs at 30%. Slovenia is upgrading the system for monitoring and analysing the state of its water environment [6] . The project will increase the capacity for integrated assessment and monitoring of the whole water cycle.   Nature and biodiversity: the land covered by Natura 2000 has expanded.Slovenia remains one of the EU countries with the largest share of land covered by Natura 2000. A new biodiversity strategy for Slovenia is being prepared.   Natural resources and waste: Slovenia is preparing a national development programme to establish an adequate waste management infrastructure and is also conducting an expert study to prepare guidelines for a resource-efficiency action plan.   Country specific issues   Instruments for financial support to companies, research institutions and individuals   Three development policy instruments with an emphasis on environmental objectives (the Centres of Excellence [7] , the competence centres [7]  and the Economy Development Centres) were established with the aim of connecting different companies with research institutions. The challenges posed by the economic crisis and environmental concerns were jointly addressed and the centres have already delivered concrete results for the economy.   Another instrument providing support to individuals is theECO Fund [8] , which creates financial incentives for various energy-efficiency measures and renewable energy schemes.   Natura 2000 MP: the Natura 2000 Management Programme [9]  for Slovenia is a strategic approach to better Natura 2000 funding. In the programme, existing policies (especially CAP and regional development) and management systems (water management, forestry, protected areas) are actively used for the achievement of Natura 2000-network objectives. Slovenia also used the LIFE+ project to share experience concerning the management of Natura 2000 with other countries [10] ., Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report  Slovenia's Environmental Indicator Report 2014[1] is the latest national report on the country's environmental issues and is also the basis for the State of Environment report[3], which is due to be published in 2015 according to the Environmental Protection Act[4]. The most relevant indicators in the report are summarised in theweb-based system Environmental indicators in Slovenia[2], which is continuously updated. The report is based on the DPSIR framework, taking into consideration the economic, social and environmental perspective. Every chapter has a summary in which the basic facts are presented along with an indication on how the environmental issues are interlinked. Every indicator has a short key message, trend-assessment sign, graph, description of the topic, and link to the relevant indicators in the system. The main themes are Air quality and Climate change, Water, Land and Nature, Natural resources and Waste, supplemented by Health, Transport, Energy, Agriculture and some other indicators related to environment. Key findings of the State of Environment report Air quality Figure 1: Exposure of 0-15 year old children to PM10 concentrations in the ambient air  Note: The PM10 WHO air quality guideline for the annual mean is 20 g/m3, while the EU limit value is set to 40 g/m3. Source: Database on hospital treatments, National Institute of Public Health, 2013; Automatic Air Quality Measurement Database (DMKZ), Slovenian Environment Agency, 2013.  Road traffic and domestic heating using wood in outdated appliances followed by power generation, industry, and agriculture are the main sources of air pollution. Particulate matter and ozoneare the major environmental and health problem. Recent health studies have confirmed links between air pollution from particulate matter PM10 and the development of asthma in children. Children in Slovenia (0-15 years of age) are on average exposed to PM10 annual concentrations of 3040 g/m3, which is above the level recommended by the WHO (Fig. 1). Measures to improve the air quality are aimed at enhancing efficiency in the transport and energy (including buildings) sectors. Freight and passenger transport volumes are increasing. Emissions from the road transit traffic are causing most concern. As Slovenia is located at the crossroad of the fifth and tenth corridor, between SE and W Europe a lot of goods are passing through Slovenia. Increase was significant after Romania and Croatia became an EU member. Climate change The average annual temperature increase in Slovenia is greater than the global average. A cause for even greater concern is the change in seasonal precipitation patterns. The number of hot days is increasing, and the precipitation regime is changing. This may cause the Triglav glacier to completely disappear in the next few years. In Slovenia, the use of fossil fuels in the energy sector, households, industry and transport accounts for more than threequarters of all greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to climate change mitigation, adaptation to changing climate is also necessary. Water Slovenia is rich in water, but water resources are vulnerable and distributed unevenly. Slovenia uses only a small portion of available water run-off for human use (about 3%). Approximately 15 billion m3 of water flows out of Slovenia through rivers every year, but long-term trends show that this volume is falling. Because of the country's headwater position and the torrential character of the majority of water courses, the flow rate varies greatly during the year, with alack of water in the vegetative period and large quantities of water - or even floods- during the other periods of the year. The annual groundwater recharge also varies considerably.  Figure 2: Chemical status of groundwater bodies in 2012   Groundwater is the main source of drinking water in Slovenia.Most groundwater bodies had a good chemical status in 2012 (Fig. 2). Water protection areas cover 17% of Slovenia's land area, and nearly one third of these water protection areas is agricultural land. The intensity of agricultural production in Slovenia has been moderately increasing in the last two decades. However, the excess of nitrogen from fertilisers and the use of phytopharmaceuticals have been declining in last decade. The percentage of people whose waste water is treated in municipal waste-water treatment plants has increased considerably, but it is still only 55%. The majority of surface water bodies have good chemical status and slightly more than half also have good ecological status. Land and nature Diverse land cover, and land use with interweaving forest, agricultural and built-up areas are characteristic of Slovenia. Forests cover more than one half of the surface area, and built-up areas slightly less than 3%, according to CORINE Land Cover data. However, the share of built-up areas has been constantly increasing. Slovenia's biotic wealth is reflected in the habitat types and species of European importance. Natura 2000 sites amount to 7 683 km2 or 37.9% of Slovenia's land area. Nearly half of Slovenia's habitat types and 28% of its species have favorable conservation status.

"the-air-and-climate-system  The air and climate system  climate system air pollution climate change consequences air and climate systemic perspectives air pollutants         Context    The layer of air surrounding our planet, better known as the  atmosphere , contains water vapour, aerosols, clouds, andmany different gases. The dry atmosphere (excluding water vapour) consists mainly of nitrogen (78.1%), oxygen (20.9%), argon (0.93%), and a large number of trace gases such as carbon dioxide and ozone (0.035%).   The air and climate system is the product of interactions between our  atmosphere and our climate . Changes in this system are to an important extent driven by the emission of  air pollutants  and greenhouse gases (GHGs). These  air pollutants  and  greenhouse gases  have a wide range of impacts on  health ,  ecosystems  and  climate . However, the precise nature of these impacts depends on the location of emissions; chemical reactions of the emitted gases; the atmospheric dispersion of these gases; and their deposition on the earth's surface.   Our understanding of the  interaction between air and climate  has improved over the last two decades, helped by better knowledge of the role played in this interaction by GHGs and air pollutants. In particular, there has been a greater realisation that some air pollutants act as so-called 'short-lived climate-forcing pollutants' (SLCPs  ). [ 1 ]  Taken together, this improved understanding has led to a growing scientific consensus thatit is best to approach air pollution and climate change mitigation as an integrated whole.    Addressing the air and climate system is a challenge for policymakers for a number of reasons. Firstly, complex atmospheric modelling systems are needed to understand the interactions of air pollutants and GHGs. Secondly, international agreements (such as the Montreal Protocol , Kyoto Protocol  [ 2 ] and the  LRTAP  Gothenburg Protocol [ 3 ] )treat air pollutant emissions separately to GHG emissions, even though GHGs and air pollutants are often emitted from the same sources. Thirdly, policy responses in this area can have complex effects. For example, some policies will lead to 'co-benefits' (where policies to reduce air pollution also reduce GHG emissions and vice versa), whereas other policies will lead to trade-offs. These complexities are described in greater detail below.   Key trends   Emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases   In Europe, over the last 20 years, emissions of both air pollutants   andGHGshave decreased. It is important to emphasise that many air pollutants and GHGs share the same emission sources (Figure 1), and that thematic mitigation policies can simultaneously impact emissions of both GHGs and air pollutants.   Figure 1: Contribution of  anthropogenic  sources to total emissions of selected air pollutants and greenhouse gases in the EU-28, 2012 [ 4 ][ 5 ]         Emissions as drivers of atmospheric composition change   Across the world, emissions of air pollutants and GHGs are changing the composition of the earth's atmosphere. At the global scale, the concentration of the six greenhouse gases included in the Kyoto Protocol has reached 446 ppm CO 2 -equivalent, an increase of around 60% compared to pre-industrial levels ( CSI013 ). Changes in  land-use  and the combustion of fossil fuels from human activities are largely responsible for this increase. In addition, global background ozone pollution levels are increasing as a consequence of the increase in ozone precursor emissions in various parts of the world. Ozone is both a GHG and an air pollutant. Finally, the impacts on European air quality of atmospheric transport of air pollution can also be significant. [ 6 ]    In Europe, air pollutant concentrations are much lowertoday than 20 years ago and many countries have achieved the emission reduction targets as set under the  NEC Directive  of 2001 and the Gothenburg Protocol of 1999. But in spite of this improvement, a large percentage of the EU  urban population  is still exposed to dangerous air pollution from  particulate matter  and ozone.   Emissions as drivers of climate change   According to the IPCC (2013), [ 7 ]  the increase in CO  2  emissions and the resulting increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO 2  is the most important driver of the increase in radiative forcing (RF) between present-day and pre-industrial conditions (Figure 2). Also th e air pollutants (CO, NMVOC, NO X , SO 2  and aerosols) and the other greenhouse gases (CH 4 , N 2 O and F-gases) have an impact on RF.    Radiative forcing (RF) is the change in the balance between incoming and outgoing  radiation flux  (expressed in W/m 2 ) at the top of the atmosphere due to changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases such as CO 2 , incoming solar radiation and changes in the extent the atmosphere and earth are reflecting solar radiation through clouds and reflective land surfaces (albedo). An increase in RF leads to additional warming of the atmosphere, whereas a negative RF results in a cooling of the atmosphere.   Figure 2: Radiative forcing estimates in 2011 relative to 1750 and aggregated uncertainties for the main drivers of climate change          Source: IPCC (2013) [ 7 ]     It can be difficult to assess the RF effects of GHG and air pollutant emissions. This is because RF is not always the direct effect of the atmospheric concentration of these air pollutants and GHGs, but also the result of their indirect interactions in the atmosphere. These indirect effects include both chemical reactions (ozone formation) and physical reactions (cloud formation and cloud composition) by the air pollutants and GHGs.   In spite of these difficulties,quantitative estimates of these indirect effects can be made, and a recent example of such an estimate is shown in Figure 2. It shows that there is a difference in the scientific understanding of different RF effects and that emissions can result either in an increase or a decrease in RF at the global scale. Over the past 260 years, emissions of CO  2  , CH  4  , N  2  O, F-gases, black carbon, CO, and NMVOC all resulted in an increase in RF. Emissions of SO  2  , organic carbon and mineral dust all contributed to a decrease in RF. Emissions of halocarbons had both a positive and negative impact on RF. Also, the emissions of NO  X  and NH  3  have had both a positive and negative RF effect, but with a negative net impact on RF. Figure 2 further highlights that interactions between aerosols and clouds resulted in a negative RF, but that the contribution of individual emitted compounds within mixes of aerosols is unknown.   Impact of climate change on air quality    Climate change  could impact future air quality in various ways. One way is through  higher temperatures leading to increased ozone formation . Another potential way that climate change can impact air quality is through a change in weather patterns creating 'stagnation events'. In such events, an absence of wind leads to high ozone and PM concentrations. A third possible way that climate change can affect air quality is through a potential change in patterns of hemispheric transport of air. [ 8 ]     Prospects    Emission levels can be affected both by policies that seek to mitigate climate change and by policies that seek to mitigate air pollution. These changes in emission levels can lead to both a decrease or increase of RF over time, and they can have both short-term and long-term effects on  climate change . This variety of effects of air policies has been recognised by policy initiatives such as the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), [ 9 ]  which focuses mitigation efforts on those air pollutants that have a clear warming effect such as black carbon and methane (as shown in Figure 2). At the EU level, the first attempts are now being made to connect the air-pollution and climate-change policy areas through the inclusion of the SLCPs methane and black carbon  in the  EU Clean Air Policy Package. [ 10 ]    However, the current policy focus on black carbon and methane is only one part of the story for future policy. As shown in Figure 2, some emission reductions will contribute to an increase in RF (SO 2 , CO) or will have a mixed RF effect (Halocarbons, NO X , NH 3 ), and for a large component of the air and climate system (aerosol-cloud interaction) it is not known what the effect will be. This poses significant scientific and policy challenges to identify those measures that will address air quality but not at the cost of climate change mitigation and vice versa.   Several studies have highlighted the positive effects of climate-change mitigation policies on atmospheric composition change. Not only will these climate-change mitigation policies result in reduced fossil fuel combustion and associated greenhouse gas emissions, they will also reduce air pollutant emissions, their impact on  human health  and  ecosystems , and some of the costs associated with  air pollution  abatement technologies. [ 11 ][ 12 ][ 13 ] On the other hand, some  climate mitigation  measures at present can have a negative effect on air pollution and will continue to do so in their present form. For example, the dieselisation of the European vehicle fleet was the result of policies designed to encourage greater use of diesel vehicles in part because they had lower CO 2  emissions per kilometre compared to gasoline vehicles. However, diesel vehicles generally emit more PM and NO X  per kilometre than gasoline cars, and in some cases this has led to high concentrations of NO 2  measured close to  traffic in cities .,Context The layer of air surrounding our planet, better known as the atmosphere, contains water vapour, aerosols, clouds, andmany different gases.

"slovakia  Slovakia  country briefings     The state of the environment in the Slovak Republic has improved significantly since 1993. However further efforts are required to achieve all objectives of environmental protection.   Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report     The SOE Report [1][2][3]  is published annually by the Ministry of the Environment of the Slovak Republic, in cooperation with the Slovak Environment Agency in accordance with section 33b of the Act 17/1992 Coll. on environment as amended. The framework structure of the SOE Report is defined in section 7 of Act 205/2004 Coll.    ... on the collection, storage and dissemination of information on the environment as amended, pursuant to which the SOE Report must  particularly  include data on the state of the environment and on causes and consequences of the said state, as well as data on trends of its development and on measures to protect and improve the environment, including international cooperation.    The content of the SOE Report consists of following chapters:      Components of the environment and their protection     Urban and rural environment     Environmental regionalisation     State of the environment  causes and consequences     Environmental risk factors     Selected tools of environmental care and International cooperation.       Within this structure, the indicators [4]  that represent a dynamic basis of the assessment process have been defined.    The annual SOE Report has to be published by 15December of the following year.    Key findings of the State of Environment report     The economy of the Slovak Republic shows a positive development of economic indicators in the long-term horizon. In most cases, the trends for environmental indicators can also be evaluated positively, which is reflected in  improvements in the quality of the environment. In most environmental indicators, there is a decoupling of their development in relation to economic growth.    Emissions of air pollutantsbetween 1993 and 2012 were reduced. However, the speed of reduction after 2000 slowed down significantly, or in some cases maintained at the same level. For some pollutants slight annual increases were recorded, especially for solid pollutants due to the increase in consumption of firewood in the households, and for persistent organic pollutants due to the increase in consumption of solvents in the chemical cleaning sector.   Greenhouse gas emissionsdecreased by 36.9% when the years 2011 and 1990 are compared. A slight increase in emissions was recorded after 2009 due to economic recovery.      Figure 1: Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the Slovak Republic       Source:  Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute     Despite these improvements in emissions, in 2012 the limit values of selected air pollutants (NO x  , PM  10  , PM  2,5  ) at several monitoring stations were exceeded. The reduction of national emissions of ozone precursors resulted in no reduction of ground-level ozone concentrations, which remain at a relatively high level as in previous years.    In 2012, waste water production fell by 47.2% compared to 1994. The number of inhabitants connected to public sewerage systems reached 62.4% in 2012.    Very good and good ecological status   was recorded in 70.51%  of   surface water bodies, and average ecological status in 25.36%. Good chemical status was recorded in 90% of surface water bodies. Good chemical status was recorded in 82.7% of  ground water bodies .    In 2012, the share of favourable drinking water analyses for compliance to limit values reached 99.67%. The number of inhabitants connected to drinking water from public water supplies reached 87.0% in 2012.   Excellent bathing water quality was recorded at 23 sites (72% of the total bathing water sites). Eight sites (25%) had good bathing water quality, and one natural swimming pool (3%) was classified as a site of sufficient quality of bathing water.    Approximately 39% of all agricultural land types were threatened by water erosion in 2012 and about 5.5% of the total area of agricultural land types were threatened by wind erosion.    According to the first report on the state of species and habitats of European importance (for the years 2004-2006): 19% of habitats and species of European importance are in a favourable condition, 34% are in an unfavourable condition, and 18% are in poor condition. The condition of 29% of habitats and species of European importance are unknown.    Concerning nature conservation , in the Slovak Republic there are 1 128 protected areas of the national network covering an area of 1 142 151 ha. This constitutes 23.3% of the country area. The  NATURA 2000 network   is made up of 473 sites of European importance constituting 11.9% of the country's area, and 41 protected bird areas constituting 26.16% of the country's area.    In 2012, 323 kg of municipal waste per capita was generated. There has been a high rate of waste landfilling in total waste disposal (almost 81% for waste other than municipal, and 74% for municipal waste).   Over the years 2006 to 2011, the share of energy produced from renewable energy sources grew by more than 49%. In 2011, the share of the energy produced from renewable energy sources reached 9.7%.     Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns     In the reportOrientation, Principles, Priorities and Main Tasks of the Care of the Environment of the Slovak Republic for 2014 - 2020(March 2013), the following seven priorities for the care of the environment were established:      Protection and rational use of water and integrated environmental management of river basins;   Adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change and flood protection;   Air and the ozone layer protection, introduction of low-carbon and environment friendly technologies;   Minimization, recovery and disposal of waste, efficient use of resources and development of green economy;   Care of biodiversity, natural heritage and landscapes;   Protection and rational use of the rock environment, elimination of environmental risks and environmental burdens;   Support to environmental education, science and research, environmental monitoring and informatics, and voluntary environmental policy instruments.     In February 2010, the management plan of the national section of the Danube River Basin District - Water Plan of the Slovak Republic  [5]   - was adopted. This management plan aims to achieve the comprehensive protection of water quality and water availability throughout the country.    National targets for the share of energy from renewable sources and measures for their adoption were established by the National Action Plan for Energy from Renewable Sources   [6]   , approved in October 2010.    The Environment and Health Action Plan of the Slovak Republic IV  [7]   was approved in January 2012. Its basic objective is to minimise environmental risks that can harm or endanger human health - especially children - through the implementation of the proposed activities.   The Waste Management Programme of the Slovak Republic for 2011 to 2015  [8]   (February 2012) sets out the waste management strategy. It specifies the objectives and measures to achieve them, as well as funding to ensure compliance with the hierarchy in waste management reflected in the Waste Directive.     In February 2013, the Strategy for PM 10  Particles Reduction  [9]   was adopted. The objective of the Strategy is to achieve and maintain good air quality throughout the Slovak Republic, i.e. scientifically sound air quality levels that do not endanger human health or the environment.     The main objective of the measures taken in   Waste Prevention Programme of the Slovak Republic for 2014-2018   [10]    (December 2013) is to decouple economic growth from environmental impacts connected with waste generation.    In January 2014, the updated National Biodiversity Strategy by 2020  [11]  was adopted. Its objective is to create a policy framework to halt the trend of biodiversity loss.   Priorities for the sustainable growth of society and for employment include the creation of a competitive economy that uses resources in an efficient and sustainable manner, minimises impacts on the environment, and is based on knowledge and innovation.          Country specific issues     The issue of environmental burdens in the Slovak Republic is being solved in a comprehensive way beyond therequirementsset by European Union.      In the years 2006 to 2008, a systematic  identification of environmental burdens  was carried out. Environmental burdens were classified into high, medium and low risk of harm. The Information System of Environmental Burdens [12]  accessible to the public was built.    In 2009 an update of the Geological Act  [13]  was adopted, which defined an environmental burden - a site, where hazardous substance caused by human activities poses a significant risk to human health or to the rock environment, groundwater and soil, except environmental damage - and a potential environmental burden - a site where a presence of contaminated soil is reasonably expected.   In 2010, the State Remediation Programme of Environmental Burdens was approved by the Government, and the regional studies of the impacts of environmental burdens on the environment were developed. The Act on 'environmental burdens' no. 409/2011  [14]  was adopted, which laid down the conditions for systematic addressing of the issue.   Also, in 2010 methodological documents such as Guideline for the Development of Risk Analyses of Contaminated Sites and the Manual for the Procedure of Financial Forecast for Exploration and Remediation were adopted.    From the Operational Programme Environment 2007-2013, projects focused on the monitoring and research of environmental burdens and risk analyses development, remediation of high risk contaminated sites, completion of the Information System of Environmental Burdens, environmental education and promotion as a support for environmental burdens addressing have been funded.    At the end of 2012, the Information System of Environmental Burdens included 905 potential environmental burdens, 260 environmental burdens and 726 remediated sites., The state of the environment in the Slovak Republic has improved significantly since 1993. However further efforts are required to achieve all objectives of environmental protection. Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report  The SOE Report[1][2][3] is published annually by the Ministry of the Environment of the Slovak Republic, in cooperation with the Slovak Environment Agency in accordance with section 33b of the Act 17/1992 Coll. on environment as amended. The framework structure of the SOE Report is defined in section 7 of Act 205/2004 Coll. ... on the collection, storage and dissemination of information on the environment as amended, pursuant to which the SOE Report mustparticularlyinclude data on the state of the environment and on causes and consequences of the said state, as well as data on trends of its development and on measures to protect and improve the environment, including international cooperation. The content of the SOE Report consists of following chapters:  Components of the environment and their protection Urban and rural environment Environmental regionalisation State of the environment  causes and consequences Environmental risk factors Selected tools of environmental care and International cooperation.  Within this structure, the indicators[4] that represent a dynamic basis of the assessment process have been defined. The annual SOE Report has to be published by 15December of the following year. Key findings of the State of Environment report The economy of the Slovak Republic shows a positive development of economic indicators in the long-term horizon. In most cases, the trends for environmental indicators can also be evaluated positively, which is reflected inimprovements in the quality of the environment. In most environmental indicators, there is a decoupling of their development in relation to economic growth. Emissions of air pollutantsbetween 1993 and 2012 were reduced. However, the speed of reduction after 2000 slowed down significantly, or in some cases maintained at the same level. For some pollutants slight annual increases were recorded, especially for solid pollutants due to the increase in consumption of firewood in the households, and for persistent organic pollutants due to the increase in consumption of solvents in the chemical cleaning sector. Greenhouse gas emissionsdecreased by 36.9% when the years 2011 and 1990 are compared. A slight increase in emissions was recorded after 2009 due to economic recovery.  Figure 1: Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the Slovak Republic Source: Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute Despite these improvements in emissions, in 2012 the limit values of selected air pollutants (NOx, PM10, PM2,5) at several monitoring stations were exceeded. The reduction of national emissions of ozone precursors resulted in no reduction of ground-level ozone concentrations, which remain at a relatively high level as in previous years. In 2012, waste water production fell by 47.2% compared to 1994. The number of inhabitants connected to public sewerage systems reached 62.4% in 2012. Very good and good ecological status was recorded in 70.51%ofsurface water bodies,and average ecological status in 25.36%. Good chemical status was recorded in 90% of surface water bodies. Good chemical status was recorded in 82.7% of ground water bodies. In 2012, the share of favourable drinking water analyses for compliance to limit values reached 99.67%. The number of inhabitants connected to drinking water from public water supplies reached 87.0% in 2012. Excellent bathing water quality was recorded at 23 sites (72% of the total bathing water sites). Eight sites (25%) had good bathing water quality, and one natural swimming pool (3%) was classified as a site of sufficient quality of bathing water. Approximately 39% of all agricultural land types were threatened by water erosion in 2012 and about 5.5% of the total area of agricultural land types were threatened by wind erosion.

"energy  Energy  energy consumption and share of renewable energy   renewable energy energy consumption energy efficiency energy policy       Setting the scene     Energy production  and use causes numerous environmental and health impacts. Today, fossil fuels continue to dominate the energy mix in Europe, contributing to  climate change  and  air pollution . This highlights the need to rethink energy systems and move quickly to a low carbon economy and society.   The SOER 2015 briefing on  energy  provides an overview of the status, trends and prospects relating to energy production and use at a European level. This SOER 2015 cross-country comparison focuses on GIEC and the contribution of renewable energy.     About the indicator    Partly as a result of numerous policy and reporting frameworks at national, European and international levels, a variety of measures and definitions are used to quantify energy generation and use. European Environment Agency (EEA) indicators provide information on primary energy consumption, GIEC, final energy consumption and gross final energy consumption. [ 1 ]        The indicator ' GIEC by fuel ' measures the quantity of energy consumed within the national territory of a country by fuel type and it is expressed in tonnes of oil equivalents. It is regularly published as part of  Eurostat  energy statistics and has a high comparability amongst countries and over time.      Policies, targets and progress   Energy is an important policy priority. As part of the Europe 2020 Strategy, [ 2 ]  the EU has committed that by 2020, it will reduce  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20% compared to 1990 levels; increase the share of renewable energy sources to 20% of gross final energy consumption; and increase energy efficiency by cutting primary energy use by 20%. [ 3 ]    Transposing European energy policy frameworks into effective national legislation is not without challenges. National policy frameworks are evolving across Europe with debates at local, national and European level on how to achieve the transition towards a low-carbon and energy-efficient future. [ 4 ]       The EEA has published  climate and energy profiles  for each EEA member country. The profiles provide information on energy demand and on progress towards meeting targets for renewable energy and for energy efficiency. [ 5 ]  The profiles also provide information on nationaltargets, policies and measuresfor both renewable energy and energy efficiency.   There was a small overall increase in total GIEC in European countries from 1990 to 2012 although it remained fairly constant for the EU-28 as a whole. National trends vary significantly during this period with GIEC decreasing in 13 countries and increasing in 20 (see Figure 1). The largest percentage decreases were recorded in Lithuania, Latvia and Romania, reflecting structural changes in the economy and improved energy efficiency. The largest increases were recorded in Iceland, Turkey and Cyprus.   Figure 1: Gross inland energy consumption in 34 European countries (1990, 2005 and 2012)          Changes in the fuel mix used to generate energy have an important influence on environmental impacts. Although consumption of solid fuels (coal and lignite) and oil have declined since 1990, consumption of coal has increased again in recent years. The overall share of renewable energy sources in GIEC more than doubled between 1990 and 2012  . However, there was substantial variation amongst countries in how the fuel mix changed over this period.    Between 1990 and 2012, there was an increase in the absolute quantity of renewable energy contributing to GIEC in all countries except Serbia. The percentage share also increased between 1990 and 2012 in all countries except Turkey (8.3%) and Norway (7.5%), with the largest percentage increases recorded in Latvia (23.2%), Iceland (22.9%) and Denmark (17.6%) (see Figure 2).   Developments concerning renewable energy should be considered in the context of very different national baselines against which change has been measured. Norway started from a relatively high baseline, and from 1990 to 2012 it had the second highest share of renewable energies in the fuel mix.   Figure 2: Percentage share of renewable energies in gross inland energy consumption in 34 European countries (1990, 2005 and 2012)        Prospects   Reducing energy consumption, improving energy efficiency, and increasing the share of renewable energy are the main ways that European countries are responding to the challenges of reducing GHG emissions, improving energy security, improving  resource efficiency , and reducing exposure to the volatility of fossil-fuel prices on the world market. However, in many countries, the economic crisis has led to a reduction in the resources available for activities such as the enforcement of standards in the building sector, or for financial assistance for energy efficiency measures and renewable energy.   The EU will meet its 20-20-20 commitments on GHG emissions and renewables. Although it may just fall short of its commitment to cut primary energy use by 20% by 2020, particularly if the reductions in energy use resulting from the 2008 economic crisis and subsequent recessions are not sustained.   The majority of countries are making progress in terms of increasing the share of renewables. The target to increase the share of renewable energy sources to 20% is based on gross final energy consumption rather than GIEC. The EEA has published an assessment of the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption in EEA member countries along with an indication of progress towards national targets (where applicable). [ 4 ]  In 2012, only three countries had not reached the indicative trajectories for meeting renewable energy targets (France, Malta and the Netherlands). [ 4 ]  According to national forecasts 23 EU Member States expect to meet their binding 2020 renewables target on their own without having to use statistical transfers or other cooperation mechanisms provided by the Renewable Energy Directive. [ 6 ]       Countries have selected different approaches when setting their national target to reduce primary energy use by 20% by 2020. Some focus on primary energy consumption, others on final energy consumption or primary energy intensity. [ 1 ]  Different modelling frameworks and assumptions have also been used along with the adoption of a range of different base years against which progress will be measured.   As each national target reflects specific national circumstances, this has led to different ambitions, with countries aiming for either a reduction in energy consumption, stabilisation, or a cap on how much energy consumption can increase relative to a baseline year. Targets are also under revision in some countries, with a range of national policy developments underway that will impact on the final target. The EEA has published a study comparing the situation in 2011 to national targets.  [ 5 ]    While there has been a lot of progress in energy efficiency policy, there is significant variation between countries in the level of ambition and coherence of their policy measures and how they implement and monitor their policies. Some have developed a well-balanced package of measures across different sectors whereas others do very little beyond the minimum required by EU directives. The EEA has made an overall assessment of EU Member States' progress towards improving energy efficiency. [ 4 ]  As further improvements are required in the majority of countries, some examples of good practice in energy efficiency are highlighted below.   Denmark provides a positive example in terms of creating an overall support framework characterised by strong links between national and regional strategies, good coordination, transparency, information and education activities, and involvement of regional and local authorities in the policy framework.   Significant progress has been observed in most countries in the public and building sectors and in setting up appropriate  governance  structures for energy efficiency, such as energy agencies. Finland and Belgium are examples of good practice in the public sector, with Finland developing a coherent sectoral strategy and Belgium implementing measures so the public sector can act as a role model. Germany and France provide examples of good practice in relation to the building sector. France has taken a leading role in enforcement, while Germany has led in relation to information, financing and setting up a governance framework.   For energy policy more broadly, good practice concerning education, capacity building and energy audits are found in Austria, Estonia and Finland. Bulgaria represents a good example for setting targets for individual companies and Sweden is a good example in setting targets for energy-intensive  industries .   Improving energy efficiency and increasing renewable energy will not only reduce GHG emissions and improve air quality, but also contribute to a reduction in environmental pressures and impacts in areas such as human health, water, biodiversity, resource use, and land use. Integrated planning of renewable energy projects and infrastructures with sharing of best practice amongst countries will be essential to improving deployment of renewable energy sources and enhancing public support for these projects.,Setting the scene Energy production and use causes numerous environmental and health impacts.

"iceland  Iceland  country briefings    Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report    Iceland does not publish a national state of the environment report on a regular basis. However, over the last 20 years, three comprehensive state of the environment reports have been published, the latest in 2009. [1] In addition, the Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources and Iceland's Environment Agency have recently published several less-comprehensive reports, which shed light on environmental trends in individual sectors.   Taken together, these two types of reports address      air quality,     climate change,     water,     waste,     biodiversity,     sustainable resource use, and     the links between environment and health.       Key findings of the State of Environment report    Climate Change    The rapid retreat of Iceland's glaciers is a very visible effect of climate change. The acidification of the oceans is another equally pressing problem, albeit a less visible one.   From 1990 (the reference year of the Kyoto Protocol) to 2012, Icelandic greenhouse gas emissions increased by 26% [8] . Most of this increase was due to the construction of two new aluminium smelters. In the year 2010 only 18% of Iceland's greenhouse gas emissions came from the waste and energy sectors. It is also noteworthy that emissions over the 20-year (1990-2010)reference period fell by 26% in the fisheries sector and 8% in the agriculture sector. Annual reports have shown Iceland to be on track to meeting its international greenhouse gas reduction commitments for the 2008-2012 period [2] . There are good prospects that Iceland will continue to fulfil its climate commitments for the current commitment period (2013-2020), helped by its participation in the EU's ETS scheme.   Figure 1: Greenhouse gas emissions by category (Thousand of tons - CO 2  equivalent)     Source: Environmental Agency of Iceland, 2014     Healthy and Safe Environment   Air quality in Iceland is generally good, but particulate matter (PM) pollution from road traffic, with sporadic additions from volcanic ash, sometimes exceeds EU limit values, especially during the winter months. Nonetheless, the monitoring values for PM and nitrogen oxide concentrations show a marked downward trend. A new environmental problem in Iceland is the pollution and annoyance in the Reykjavk region caused by hydrogen sulphide from nearby geothermal power plants. [3]    Waste   The management of solid waste has improved greatly, and in 2012 69% of all solid waste was recycled or incinerated for energy. Since 1999, all open-pit incineration has been eliminated, and between 2008 and 2012 four waste incinerators that did not meet EU emission standards were closed down.    Water   The 2013 Status Report on Iceland's waterbodies evaluated the main impacts caused by human activity on water bodies, and whether individual Icelandic water bodies met environmental objectives of good quality. [4]    As of 2010, about 73% of the population is connected to some kind of wastewater treatment. The remaining 27% mainly live in remote coastal villages. [5][1]    Seafood and fishing are important economic sectors in Iceland. Contamination by persistent organic pollutants of seafood from Icelandic waters has continued to fall over the last 10-15 years. Iceland considers this positive development to be the result of international agreements. [1]    Conservation of Icelandic nature and sustainable use of resources   Many areas were put under nature conservation during the period 2008-2012. The most important of these areas is the Vatnajkull National Park, established in 2008. Vatnajkullis Europe's largest national park and includes Europe's largest glacier. [5]      Main policy responses to key environmentalchallenges and concerns     Iceland's National Strategy for Sustainable Development 2002-2020 hasstimulated new policy initiatives on environmental issues of national importance. These issues are further elaborated in a report by the Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources.These initiatives include:     A soil conservation strategy for 2003-2014   The Master Plan for Hydro and Geothermal Energy Resources [6] . This was adopted in 2013 by the Icelandic parliament, and it aims to analyse and identify options for the development of energy resources in Iceland, taking all environmental constraints fully into account.   A national action plan for the management of solid waste [7]    A strategy and action plan against climate change until 2050   A strategy for biological diversity   A nature conservation strategy for 2009-2013     Two major cargo ships have stranded in Icelandic waters in the past 20 years. One stranding occurred on the south coast in March 1997 and the second occurred on the Reykjanes peninsula on the south west coast in December 2006. Following the second stranding, a governmental committee was established to conduct a hazard assessment of sailing routes for oil tankers and large freight ships in Icelandic waters. The area off the south coast is the most important spawning ground for cod and other important fish species. In spring 2007, the proposal made by the committee was discussed and accepted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). As a result, the authorised sailing routes of oil tankers and large freight ships were moved further away from the south-coast shoreline.    Another prominent policy response to environmental concerns is the new carbon tax on fuel (petrol and diesel) as well as tax concessions for the import of 'green' cars (electric, methane and hybrids). Also, a 2010 regulation has now taken full effect for the purpose of lowering hydrogen-sulphide pollution in the Reykjavkarea.         Country specific issues     In spite of the fact that ' green energy ' accounts for almost all space heating and electricity (geothermal sources for heat, and hydropower for electricity), Iceland's greenhouse gas footprint (in tonnes of carbon per capita per year) is relatively high compared to other OECD countries. This is mainly because of large emissions from primary metal smelters and the dependence on fossil fuels by the transport and fishery industries. Being a sub-Arctic or semi-Arctic country, with great sensitivity to climate change, climate policies are considered important and are taken seriously. Therefore, Iceland will strive to continue to meet its Kyoto commitments for the current commitment period 2013-2020.    Also, there is continuous debate over the environmental impact of energy projects, which until recently were all considered 'green'. Lately there has been increasing focus and criticism on the externalities associated with geothermal power plants.   Iceland's natural environment is in many ways unique, attracting many tourists every year. However, many areas are vulnerable to intrusion and a constant stream of visitors, and can thus lose their natural value in a relatively short period of time. The value of wilderness areas on the planet is increasing fast in line with increased population and industrial growth. Increasing debate and controversy over both hydro-electric projects and geothermal developments have bolstered the scope for alternative energy solutions such as wind power and tidal energy. There is also increasing focus on electric cars as a way to reduce the country's environmental footprint. Green electricity and relatively short commuting distances should bode well for such a major shift.   Although not a policy, it should be mentioned that an active campaign has been ongoing against the use of studded tyres (removing the studded tyres would reduce PM pollution) and major steps have been taken to extend and improve bike paths and promote public transport in the Reykjavk area to reduce environmental pressures.   Natural hazards such as periodic volcanic eruptions are an issue of concern for Iceland. The impact these eruptions have on landscape, vegetation, and PM pollution can be very high.   Tourism is another issue causing growing environmental concern. The number of tourists visiting Iceland per year will soon amount to three times the country's population. Almost all tourists visit the same few sites. There is an intense debate over how to manage the Icelandic tourist industry in a sustainable way, especially with respect to the highly sensitive natural sites.,Main themes and sectors addressed in thenational State of Environment report Iceland does not publish a national state of the environment report on a regular basis. However, over the last 20 years, three comprehensive state of the environment reports have been published, the latest in 2009.[1]In addition, the Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources and Iceland's Environment Agency have recently published several less-comprehensive reports, which shed light on environmental trends in individual sectors. Taken together, these two types of reports address  air quality, climate change, water, waste, biodiversity, sustainable resource use, and the links between environment and health.  Key findings of the State of Environment report Climate Change  The rapid retreat of Iceland's glaciers is a very visible effect of climate change. The acidification of the oceans is another equally pressing problem, albeit a less visible one. From 1990 (the reference year of the Kyoto Protocol) to 2012, Icelandic greenhouse gas emissions increased by 26%[8]. Most of this increase was due to the construction of two new aluminium smelters. In the year 2010 only 18% of Iceland's greenhouse gas emissions came from the waste and energy sectors. It is also noteworthy that emissions over the 20-year (1990-2010)reference period fell by 26% in the fisheries sector and 8% in the agriculture sector. Annual reports have shown Iceland to be on track to meeting its international greenhouse gas reduction commitments for the 2008-2012 period[2]. There are good prospects that Iceland will continue to fulfil its climate commitments for the current commitment period (2013-2020), helped by its participation in the EU's ETS scheme.
