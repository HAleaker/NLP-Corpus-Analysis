"assessment-2  Use of freshwater resources     In general, renewable water is abundant in Europe. However, signals from long-term climate and hydrological assessments, including on population dynamics, indicate that there was a 24 % decrease in renewable water resources per capita across Europe between 1960 and 2010, particularly in southern Europe.   The densely populated river basins in different parts of Europe, which correspond to 11 % of the total area of Europe, continue to be hotspots for water stress conditions, and, in the summer of 2014, there were 86 million inhabitants inthese areas.   Around 40 % of the inhabitants in the Mediterranean region lived under water stress conditions in the summer of 2014.   Groundwater resources and rivers continue to be affected by overexploitation in many parts of Europe, especially in the western and eastern European basins.   A positive development is that water abstraction decreased by around 7 %between 2002 and 2014.   Agriculture is still the main pressure on renewable water resources. In the spring of 2014, this sector used 66 % of the total water used in Europe. Around 80 % of total water abstraction for agriculture occurred in the Mediterranean region. The total irrigated area in southern Europe increased by 12 % between 2002 and 2014, but the total harvested agricultural production decreased by 36 % in the same period in this region.   On average, water supply for households per capita is around 102 L/person per day in Europe, which means that there is 'no water stress'. However, water scarcity conditions created by population growth and urbanisation, including tourism, have particularly affected small Mediterranean islands and highly populated areas in recent years.   Because of the huge volumes of water abstracted for hydropower and cooling, the hydromorphology and natural hydrological regimes of rivers and lakes continue to be altered.   The targets set in the water scarcity roadmap, as well as the key objectives of the Seventh Environment Action Programme in the context of water quantity, were not achieved in Europe for the years 20022014.

"noise-pollution-in-the-spotlight  Noise pollution in the spotlight  In April, the European Environment Agency will help raise awareness of the growing problem of noise pollution across Europe. We discussed with Colin Nugent, an EEA noise pollution expert, the very real health impacts of noise which are often underestimated.    Why is noise pollution so important?    If you were to talk to most experts about pollution they tend to point to air pollution, water or waste. Noise tends to be one of the forgotten pollutants. However, if you look at environmental surveys, you see that citizens bring it up. People can connect much more to noise as a pollutant because invariably almost everyone has experienced a noise problem. Although they may not be fully aware of the health impacts, they can hear it very clearly and they know they are annoyed by it. Exposure to noise generally raises your stress levels, it raises your ‘fight-or-flight’ instinct in terms of threatening noises like aircraft, or very busy highways near your home. If you are subjected to those noise levels on a long term basis, as many urban dwellers in Europe are, it has an impact. The hyper tension and stress caused by exposure to noise can cause cardiovascular disease, stroke and ultimately mortality. So without realising it, the health impacts of noise are very real. Considering how many people live in cities in Europe and how our cities are expanding and how our demand for transport, mobility, extra flights, is also growing, noise is becoming a major issue for all of us.   What are the top three noise emitters in Europe?   If you ask an average citizen on the street, they will tell you it’s his or her next door neighbour’s dog, or the neighbour’s party on the weekend — a direct annoyance which effects your quality of life. People might not be completely aware that there is a major highway near their house; they hear it all the time, but they get used to it – it is background noise. But when we are looking at larger European Environment Agency assessments, the top emitter is our road transport network, followed by railways and aircraft noise. Aircraft noise tends to have more detrimental health effects than the others. However, the numbers of people exposed to aircraft are a good deal lower than they are for road traffic, because the road transport network is widespread, while airports are concentrated. Railway noise is also an issue but it tends to be more concentrated as well, and it can be easier to tackle. It’s not the same in case of road transport. There are so many vehicles, maintenance is up to the owner and there are so many different standards in terms of vehicles.   What has the European Union done to address the problem?   The EU has a very challenging target in the 7 th  Environment Action Programme - that is to significantly reduce noise pollution by 2020. It also aims to draw closer to the World Health Organization standards, because there are considerable differences. The EU also has a significant amount of legislation in place, including the Environmental Noise Directive, which requires assessments done by noise mapping and action plans to be drawn up. This directive is designed to inform other pieces of legislation covering emissions from road vehicles, trucks, trains, and aircraft. The directive also sets a number of noise indicators to be applied in noise mapping. These indicators represent a physical scale for the description of environmental noise. The two most important are the day-evening-night indicator, designed to assess annoyance, and the night-level indicator (Lnight) which is designed to assess sleep disturbance. These indicators are to be applied to mapping exposure assessments beginning at 55 decibels (dB) for day exposure and 50 dB for night exposure.   What is the EEA doing in assessing noise pollution?    We use the data gathered from mapping to publish regular assessments. Our reports are designed to inform policy makers and to raise awareness of the problem. To mark this year’s International Noise Awareness Day (26 April), we will publish a briefing with updated data on noise levels across Europe. The  last report was published in 2014 . This year is quite a big year for noise. The European Commission has decided to make this one if its key awareness raising initiatives for the year, to make Europeans aware of the problem of noise, what’s being done and what needs to be done still to improve the acoustic environment in Europe. Our upcoming briefing coincides with the Noise in Europe conference in Brussels on 24 April, where our Executive Director will present our latest findings. Although we are getting new information all the time, we still have gaps in the data. The more complete data we have, the more we can improve our knowledge of the problem, and policy makers will be better informed to take better action.   What can citizens do to reduce exposure to noise?   We can certainly look at changing the way we do things, take for example electric vehicles. They give a very immediate benefit, not only for air quality but also for noise emissions. They are very quiet vehicles. When you drive on city streets, you are driving at such low speeds generally, that electric cars give a very real benefit in terms of reduced noise emissions. Europe also has a labelling system for road tyres. It informs the consumer not only about the energy efficiency of the tyre, its safety, but also about the noise emission of the tyre. So consumers can choose quieter tyres. There is also the ‘Quiet mark’ labelling scheme where consumers can choose to buy fridges and other appliances, or lawn mowers that have the quiet labels, for example.

"what-does-nature-mean-to  What does nature mean to you?  NATURE@work photo competition launched  Nature works hard to protect us and to sustain our everyday lives — a fact that is often under-appreciated. But it plays a vital role, providing clean air, clean drinking water, clothing, food and raw materials we use to build shelter. Other benefits are not so well known, such as the role nature plays in alleviating the effects of climate change. To highlight the important role nature plays in our lives, the European Environment Agency (EEA) invites you to participate in capturing how nature benefits you through the ‘NATURE@work’ photography competition.   The EEA’s annual photo competition aims to engage with Europeans around different environmental issues and this year’s competition focuses on the benefits we receive from nature. Did you know that green spaces in and around our cities help protect our homes from flooding by absorbing excess flood water, or that trees and urban parks help lower temperatures in urban areas during heatwaves? With its intrinsic beauty and rich diversity, nature is also a source of inspiration not only for art but also for designing machines, homes and many innovation solutions.    The European Union has been committed to protecting nature and biodiversity since the 1970s . This year marks the 25 th  anniversary of the adoption of one of the key nature protection laws in the EU, the Habitats Directive. With this legislation, the EU has built the largest coordinated network of protected areas in the world through Natura 2000, which covers 18% of the EU’s land area and more than 6% of its seas territories. These efforts are supported by LIFE, the EU’s financial instrument for environmental, nature conservation and climate action projects.  The EU is also active in finding nature-based solutions to support economic growth, create jobs and enhance our well-being .   The ‘NATURE@work’ photo competition is open to all European citizens over the age of 18 and invites them to submit photographs that illustrate any of the following three themes:     NATUREprovides: Can you capture in a photo the benefits nature makes available that you cherish most?   NATUREprotects: Have you noticed how the nature around you – in the countryside, your town or city, protects you?   NATUREinspires: Can you spot anything around you that was inspired by nature?      The winners in each category above will be awarded a cash prize. All entries may be promoted by the EEA and its partners across Europe. You can submit your photos until 15 August.

"effective-policies-are-based-on  Effective policies are based on a robust knowledge base and solid science  At all governance levels, public policy making entails making decisions between different options and approaches. Some decisions, such as to invest in fossil fuels or renewables, might involve selecting one option over the other. Others might address the ‘how’ question – we will invest in renewables but which ones are the best for the society? Each policy decision results in outcomes, some of which might be unforeseen, unexpected or even detrimental to those whose lives it is supposed to improve. In the long term, the overall harm can be much larger than gains in the short term. To achieve the positive and lasting results on the ground, policy makers need to be able to make informed decisions, after assessing the benefits and costs of each available option.   An effective policy almost always relies on science. Similarly, measuring the effectiveness of a policy decision requires targets, which in turn entail a mechanism to monitor progress over time. Target setting and progress reporting also rely on scientific methods and evidence. These approaches are embedded throughout the European Union’s environment and climate policies.      The EU’s air quality policies, for example, aim to reduce the harm caused by various air pollutants and pollution sources. Long-term exposure to even low doses of air pollution constitutes a health risk, affecting us all at varying degrees. Medical science has long confirmed the links between poor air quality and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, impacting the young and the elderly in particular.   Science can identify causes and solutions   To monitor EU air pollution, Member States have set up more than 2 000 monitoring stations, regularly reporting the concentrations of various air pollutants in city centres, on roadsides or in rural areas. All this data is measured and processed in a way that is coherent across the EU and comparable over time. This reporting infrastructure allows policy makers to understand where and why there are pollution exceedances and helps inform what they can do to tackle it. Air quality modelling, informed by best science, is instrumental in identifying cause and effect relations, such as the number of diesel cars or coal-fired power plants and their impacts on urban air quality. This type of understanding is essential for designing appropriate policy responses and solutions.    At the local level, many cities have taken specific action to improve air quality. For example, the mayors of Paris, Madrid and Athens have proposed measures to ban diesel cars and vans from city centres by 2025 to improve air quality and reduce the associated damage to human health. Other cities struggling with repeated air pollution episodes are having to consider similar actions.     Trends can trigger action    In other cases, science-based evidence does not need to be time and location specific to provide reliable information, highly relevant to policy decisions. Informed policy decisions do not always need to be taken on the basis of complex spreadsheets listing hourly ozone readings at every monitoring station. Trend lines can equally strongly convey the message that action must be taken to reduce air pollution and its health impacts. Even with gaps in data, environmental and climate trends can send out a strong and convincing call for policy action.     Although the scope of climate science, including the multiple impacts of climate change, is very broad and deals with a level of complexity, non-linear relations, tipping points and thus a number of uncertainties, its central findings are quite clear: our planet is warming and our dependence on fossil fuels contributes to this warming. We also know that certain regions, not only across the globe but also in Europe, will be more affected by the adverse impacts of climate change than others. These findings have triggered many ambitious policies both at EU and global levels, including the EU’s climate and energy targets for 2030 and the Paris Agreement under the United Nations umbrella.     In fact, uncertainty and data gaps do not undermine the validity of scientific conclusions. They are an integral part of science and are clearly acknowledged in assessments. By acknowledging potential weaknesses, scientific knowledge evolves continuously, improving its methods, models and analysis.     Improvements in scientific knowledge and progress reporting towards a policy target can lead to policy improvements, such as adjustments to testing methods of carbon dioxide emissions from cars and vans or setting more rigorous climate and energy targets for 2030.     Our core work at the European Environment Agency deals directly with conveying scientific knowledge to policy makers and the public. We are a knowledge institution at the centre of an extensive network ( European Environment Information and Observation Network ), bringing together experts from national institutions and other bodies across 39 European countries. The EEA provides independent and reliable information on a wide range of topics linked to Europe’s environment and climate.

"assessment-2  Production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances   A significant reduction in the consumption of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) has been achieved by the EEA-33 countries since 1986. This reduction has been largely driven by the 1987 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Montreal Protocol.   Upon entry into force of the Montreal Protocol, EEA-33 consumption was approximately 420 000 ozone-depleting potential tonnes (ODP tonnes). Consumption values around zero were reached in 2002 and have remained consistently so ever since. S ince the early 1990s, th  e European Union (EU) has taken additional measures, in the shape of  EU law,  to reduce the consumption of ODS. In many aspects, the current EU regulation on substances that deplete the ozone layer (1005/2009/EC) goes further than the Montreal Protocol and it has also brought forward the phasing out of   hydrochlorofluorocarbons   (HCFCs) in the EU.    csi climate change air ozone air emissions ozone air pollution ozone depleting substances       CSI CSI006 CLIM CLIM049 006 049"
"cities-taking-action-learning-from  Cities taking action, learning from each other to adapt to climate change  Despite budgetary challenges, cities and towns across Europe are taking action to put in place measures that will help them adapt to the impacts of climate change. A new European Environment Agency (EEA) report released today highlights the opportunities open to municipalities to share best practices and how they can support projects like green roofs or expanding city parks to help alleviate the negative effects of climate change.   The EEA report  Financing urban adaptation to climate change, takes a closer look at innovative funding options now being used, such as green bonds and crowdfunding, alongside traditional funding channels. The report includes case studies that analyse how 11 cities across Europe are developing, funding and implementing urban adaptation measures. The case studies outline various projects that will help cities better protect themselves from the damage caused by extreme weather events. These include building more green spaces and installing green roofs, which enhance water retention and provide cooling as well as thermal insulation.   The publication is meant to serve as a resource for adaptation financing providers and project developers from international, national or regional public bodies and private institutions. The report also includes a helpful annex providing an overview of European-level financing options available to municipalities.   Innovative funding options   The costs needed to adapt cities to the effects of climate change vary but can run into millions of euros. The lack of funding has been cited by mayors, city managers and planners as one of the main reasons for the slow uptake of adaptation. Public funds for adaptation measures can be difficult to find in wake of other budgetary priorities. At the same time, many European cities and towns are facing significant investment needs to replace old infrastructure for basic services (such as sewer systems), buildings and transport over the next decade. Integrating climate adaptation requirements into such investments would save money in the long term, the report argues.   Municipalities across Europe have found different ways to finance adaptation. These range from tapping into public funds to more innovative financing mechanisms, including crowdfunding and green bonds. Green infrastructure measures with multiple benefits, such as nature conservation, recreation and quality of life, are receiving increased attention. Demonstrating multiple benefits of such measures can increase the chance of securing funds.   Cities are also organising themselves to share best practices and promote environmental cooperation through the  Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy  and other similar organisations.   The European Union has earmarked at least 20 percent of all its expenditures during the 2014-2020 budget period for climate change action  for mitigation and adaptation. Further national and regional financial streams are also available. However, the funds available through the EU and national and regional authorities meet only a small part of the investment needed. Public investment can act as seed money unlocking additional major private investment of a different type and scale.   The 11 case studies involve the following cities: Amsterdam, Bilbao, Bologna, Bratislava, Copenhagen, Ghent, Hamburg, Lisbon, Malm, Paris, and Smolyan.

"assessment  Population exposure to environmental noise     Noise pollution is a major environmental health problem in Europe.   Road traffic is the mostwidespread source of environmental noise, with an estimated 120 million people affected by harmful levels. Noise from railways, airports and industry are also important sources of noise.   The European Union's (EU) Seventh Environment Action Programme sets the objective that by 2020 noise pollution in the EU has significantly decreased, moving closer to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended levels.     noise exposure noise  TERM TERM005 CSI CSI051 005 051,This indicatorprovides an overview of the estimated number of people exposed to levels of environmental noise in Europe that are above the noise indicator levels set by the EU Environmental Noise Directive (2002/49/EC) within and outside urban areas. The major source of noise pollution both inside and outside urban areas is road traffic. Noise from railways and aircraft has a much lower impact in terms of overall population noise exposure, but both remain important sources of localised noise pollution. It is estimated that more than 120 million people in the EU are exposed to Lden noise levels (annual average day, evening and night period of exposure) from road traffic that are above 55dB. Night-time road traffic is another major source of noise exposure, with over 83 million Europeans being exposed to harmful Lnight levels above 50dB. In addition, many people are also exposed to rail, aircraft and industrial noise, particularly in towns and cities.More general impacts of exposure to harmful levels of environmental noise includeannoyance, stress reactions, sleep disturbance and an increase in the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease which can lead to premature death. While aircraft noise does not affect a wide geographical area, its documented harmful effects extend beyond health impacts on nearby populations to also impairing the ability of younger generations to concentrate in schools that are affected by aircraft flight paths."

At mid-latitudes no significant changes in annual precipitation have been observed. Mean summer precipitation has significantly decreased by up to 20mm per decade in most of southern Europe, while significant increases of up to 18mm per decade have been recorded in parts of northern Europe.   Projected changes in precipitation vary substantially across regions and seasons. Annual precipitation is generally projected to increase in northern Europe and to decrease in southern Europe. The projected decrease in southern Europe is strongest in the summer.     scenarios climate change key climate variables precipitation temperature     CLIM CLIM002 002,Past trends According to the E-OBS dataset [i], average annual precipitation across Europe shows no significant changes since 1960. However, significant changes have been observed at sub-continental scales. Most precipitation studies show a tendency towards wetter conditions in the Northern Hemisphere throughout the 20th century, but the changes are less spatially coherent than temperature change. The majority of Scandinavia and the Baltic states have observed an increase in annual precipitation of greater than 17mm per decade, which is as high as 70mm per decade in western Norway (Figure 1, left panel). Winter precipitation (December to February) tends to decrease in limited areas in southern Europe, and significant increases (up to 70mm per decade) have been recorded in most of northern Europe [ii]. In contrast, annual precipitation has decreased by up to 90mm per decade in the Iberian Peninsula, in particular in central Portugal. Mean summer (June to August) precipitation has significantly decreased by up to 20mm per decade in most of southern Europe, while significant increases (up to 18mm per decade) have been recorded in parts of northern Europe (Figure 1, right panel) [iii]. Changes in large-scale circulation patterns (synoptic atmospheric circulation) play a key role in the observed changes in precipitation [iv]. It is not clear if the relatively minor land-use changes in Europe since the 1950s have influenced observed precipitation trends [v]. Projections For a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), the models (ensemble mean) project a statistically significant increase in annual precipitation in large parts of central and northern Europe (of up to about 30%) and a decrease in southern Europe (of up to 40%) from 19712000 to 20712100 (Figure 2 left panel); in summer, the precipitation decrease extends northwards (Figure 2 right panel) [vi]. A zone with small changes that are not significant (but are, however, partially robust in the direction of the change), shows where the precipitation pattern (as presented in the ensemble mean) changes the direction of the change. For a medium emissions scenario (RCP4.5), the magnitude of change is smaller, but the pattern is very similar to the pattern for the RCP8.5 scenario. The range of projected changes in precipitation from the multi-model ensemble are generally the same between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, or larger in RCP8.5, especially at the end of the century [vi].

"climate-change-poses-increasingly-severe  Climate change poses increasingly severe risks for ecosystems, human health and the economy in Europe  Europe’s regions are facing rising sea levels and more extreme weather, such as more frequent and more intense heatwaves, flooding, droughts and storms due to climate change, according to a European Environment Agency report published today. The report assesses the latest trends and projections on climate change and its impacts across Europe and finds that better and more flexible adaptation strategies, policies and measures will be crucial to lessen these impacts.   The observed changes in climate are already having wide-ranging impacts on ecosystems, the economy and on human health and well-being in Europe, according to the report ‘ Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe 2016 ’. New records continue to be set on global and European temperatures, sea levels and reduced sea ice in the Arctic. Precipitation patterns are changing, generally making wet regions in Europe wetter and dry regions drier. Glacier volume and snow cover are decreasing. At the same time, climate-related extremes such as heat waves, heavy precipitation and droughts, are increasing in frequency and intensity in many regions. Improved climate projections provide further evidence that climate-related extremes will increase in many European regions.   ‘Climate change will continue for many decades to come. The scale of future climate change and its impacts will depend on the effectiveness of implementing our global agreements to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but also ensuring that we have the right adaptation strategies and policies in place to reduce the risks from current and projected climate extremes,’ said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director.   Climate change hotspots   All European regions are vulnerable to climate change, but some regions will experience more negative impacts than others. Southern and south-eastern Europe is projected to be a climate change hotspot, as it is expected to face the highest number of adverse impacts. This region is already experiencing large increases in heat extremes and decreases in precipitation and river flows, which have heightened the risk of more severe droughts, lower crop yields, biodiversity loss and forest fires. More frequent heat waves and changes in the distribution of climate-sensitive infectious diseases are expected to increase risks to human health and well-being.   Coastal areas and floodplains in western parts of Europe are also seen as hotspots as they face an increased risk of flooding from rising sea levels and a possible increase in storm surges. Climate change is also leading to major changes in marine ecosystems as a result of ocean acidification, warming and the expansion of oxygen-depleted dead zones.   Ecosystems and human activities in the Arctic will also be strongly affected owing to the particularly rapid increase in air and sea temperatures and the associated melting of land and sea ice.   Although some regions may also experience some positive impacts, such as improving conditions for agriculture in parts of northern Europe, most regions and sectors will be negatively affected.   Map ES.1 Key observed and projected climate change and impacts for the main biogeographical regions in Europe           Source: EEA, 2017     Ecosystems, human health and economy   Ecosystems and protected areas across Europe are under pressure from climate change and other stressors, such as land use change. The report highlights that the impacts of climate change are a threat to biodiversity at land and in the seas. Many animal and plant species are experiencing changes to their life cycles and are migrating northwards and to higher altitudes, while various invasive species have established themselves or have expanded their range. Marine species, including commercially important fish stocks, are also migrating northwards. These changes affect various ecosystem services and economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry and fisheries.   The main health effects of climate change are linked to extreme weather events, changes in the distribution of climate-sensitive diseases, and changes in environmental and social conditions. River and coastal flooding has affected millions of people in Europe in the last decade. The health effects include injuries, infections, exposure to chemical hazards and mental health consequences. Heatwaves have become more frequent and intense, leading to tens of thousands of premature deaths in Europe. This trend is projected to increase and to intensify, unless appropriate adaptation measures are taken. The spread of tick species, the Asian tiger mosquito and other disease carriers increases the risk of Lyme disease, tick-borne encephalitis, West Nile fever, dengue, chikungunya and leishmaniasis.   The economic costs of climate change can be very high. Climate-related extreme events in EEA member countries account for more than EUR 400 billion of economic losses since 1980. Available estimates of the future costs of climate change in Europe consider only some sectors and show considerable uncertainty. Still, the projected damage costs from climate change are highest in the Mediterranean region. Europe is also affected by climate change impacts occurring outside Europe through trade effects, infrastructure, geopolitical and security risks, and migration.   Enhancing adaptation and knowledge   Mainstreaming of climate change adaptation into other policies is progressing but can be further enhanced. Other possible further actions include improving policy coherence across different policy areas and governance levels (EU, transnational, national and subnational), more flexible adaptive management approaches, and the combination of technological solutions, ecosystem-based approaches and ‘soft’ measures.   The development and use of climate and adaptation services are increasing in Europe. Improved knowledge would be useful in various areas, for example, on vulnerability and risk assessments at various scales and on monitoring, reporting and evaluation of adaptation actions, their costs and benefits, and synergies and trade-offs with other policies.   Background   The report is an indicator-based assessment of past and projected climate change and its impacts on ecosystems and society. It also looks at society’s vulnerability to these impacts and at the development of adaptation policies and the underlying knowledge base.   The report was developed by the EEA in collaboration with the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the World Health Organisation Regional Office for Europe and three European Topic Centres (ETC-CCA, ETC-BD, ETC-ICM). This is the fourth ‘Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe’ report, which is published every four years. This edition aims to support the implementation and review process of the 2013 EU Adaptation Strategy, which is foreseen for 2018, and the development of national and transnational adaptation strategies and plans.   climate change impacts climate change adaptation extreme temperatures weather and climate extremes damage extreme weather and climate climate change mitigation climate change and health threats to biodiversity precipitation extremes,The observed changes in climate are already having wide-ranging impacts on ecosystems, the economy and on human health and well-being in Europe, according to the report ‘Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe 2016’.

"assessment  Economic losses from climate-related extremes     The total reported economic losses caused by weather and climate-related extremes in the EEA member countries over the period 1980-2015 amount to around EUR 433 billion (in 2015 Euro values). The average annual economic losses have varied between EUR 7.5billion in the period 1980-1989, EUR 13.5 billion in the period 1990-1999, and EUR 14.3 billion in the period 2000-2009. In the period from 2010 to 2015 the average annual loss accounted to around EUR 13.3 billion.    The observed variations in reported economic loss over time are difficult to interpret since a large share of the total deflated losses has been caused by a small number of events. Specifically, more than 70 % of the economic losses was caused by only 3 % of all registered events.     natural hazards in eea weather and climate extremes damage weather damage natural catastrophes statistics natural disasters climate damage climate change       CSI CSI042 CLIM CLIM039 042 039,Past trends According to data from NatCatService of Munich Re [4]on natural disasters between 1980 and 2015 in the member countries of European Environment Agency (EEA), weather and climate-related extremes [1] accounted for 92% of total reported disaster events and around 83% of the total losses. Specifically, weather and climate related losses amounted to EUR 433 billion (at 2015 Euro values[2]), on average EUR12 billion per year, EUR 75 800 per square kilometre, or EUR 780 per capita[3]. Losses are equal to 0.1% of the cumulative deflated GDP over the analysed period, or nearly 3% of the GDP in 2015. Around 35% of the total losses were insured (Figure/Table 1). There were 89 873 casualties registered over the period. The assessment is based on the Munich Re dataset[4], and the Eurostat collection of economic indicators [5], whereas data from earlier years not covered by Eurostat have been completed from the Annual Macro-Economic Database of the European Commission (AMECO), the International Monetary Funds (IMF) World Economic Outlook (WEO), the Total Economy Database (TED) and the World Banks database. The distribution of weather and climate related losses among the thirty three EEA member countries is uneven. The highest overall economic losses in absolute terms were registered in Germany, Italy and United Kingdom (see Figure/Table 1). The highest losses per capita were recorded in Switzerland, Denmark, and Austria. The greatest shares of total losses in terms of cumulative GDP were registered in Croatia, Czech Republic, and Hungary. The three least affected countries in absolute terms were Liechtenstein, Iceland and Malta. In relative terms (per capita) the least affected countries include Turkey, Estonia and Latvia. In terms of loss as a share of cumulative GDP, the least affected countries include Liechtenstein, Iceland and Estonia. The largest 34 events caused about half of the recorded losses. The costliest climate extremes were the 2002 flood in Central Europe (almost EUR 20 billion), followed by the 2003 drought and heatwave (EUR 15 billion) and 1999 winter storm, Lothar (EUR 15 billion). One important question is to what extent the observed increase in overall losses during recent decades is attributable to changing climatic conditions rather than other factors. According to AR5 of the IPCC [i], increasing exposure of people and economic assets has been the major cause of long-term increases in economic losses from weather and climate-related disasters. Long-term trends in economic disaster losses, adjusted for wealth and population increases, have not been attributed to climate change, but a role for climate change has not been excluded. Available studies for economic losses from river floods and storms in Europe suggest that the observed increases in losses are primarily due to increases in populations, economic wealth and developments in hazard-prone areas, but the observed increase in heavy precipitation in parts of Europe may have also played a role[ii]. There is evidence that improved flood protection and prevention contributed to reducing losses over time in some cases[iii]. For the period between 1980 and 2015, the economic losses of all natural disasters in the EEA member countries amounted to EUR 520 billion and the insured losses were around EUR 154 billion (in 2015 values) (Figure 2). Around 64 % of all economic losses were due to meteorological and hydrological events, while most of fatalities were caused by heat waves. This large portion of fatalities is highly influenced by the heatwave of 2003, where around 70 000 fatalities were reported as excess mortality (Figure 2). Recorded economic losses from weather and climate related extremes in Europe have varied substantially over time. The average annual economic loss (inflation-corrected) was around EUR 7.5 billion per year in the 1980s (1980-1989), EUR 13.4 billion in the 1990s (1990-1999), EUR 14.3 billion per year in the 2000s (2000-2009). In the period 2010 to 2015 , the average annual economic loss accounted to around EUR 13.3 billion (Figure 3). However, the pattern that can be found in the recorded loss is obfuscated by high variability: around 3% of events, some of which affected more than one country, account for around 70% of total deflated loss. Conversely, some three quarters of the registered events were responsible for only half a percentage point of the total losses. The increased economic wealth has a major effect on the annual losses. Currently there is no mechanism in place for reporting the economical losses from weather and weather and climate-related events by the EU member states to the European Commission or the EEA. However activities are underway to improve national databases on disaster losses, coordinated by JRC IPSC[6]. Once comparable national databases are available for all EU member states and EEA member countries and these data would be reported in future, this EEA indicator can be based on such data instead of data from Munich Re. Projections The IPCCAR5 concludes that high temperature extremes, heavy precipitation events and droughts will markedly increase in all or most world regions, including in Europe. Furthermore, large parts of Europe will face an increasing drought risk [iv]. There is medium confidence in the fact that climate change will increase the likelihood of systemic failures across European countries as a result of extreme climate events affecting multiple sectors [v]. Increasing extremes will presumably lead to greater losses. However, the future cost of climate-related hazards in Europe will depend on several factors, including the resilience and vulnerability of society, which are variable across hazards and regions.   [1] The analysed hazards are classified by Munich Re in four categories: geophysical, meteorological, hydrological and climatological. For the purpose of this indicator weather and climate-related events are defined as the combination of meteorological, hydrological and climatological events in the Munich Re database.   [2] The exact estimate differ by several percentage points depending on choices made, including the price indices chosen for accounting for inflation, reference base (annual, monthly) for the conversion between losses expressed in USD and EUR, etc.   [3] Based on average population over the entire period 1980-2015.

"assessment-1  Final energy consumption by sector and fuel    Between 2005 and 2014, final energy consumption decreased by 11 % (1.3 % annually) in the EU-28. Final energy consumption decreased in all sectors, particularly in the industry and households sectors (16.5 % and 14.8 %, respectively), but also in the transport (4.5 %) and services sectors (1.7 %). This decrease in final energy consumption since 2005 was influenced by economic performance, structural changes in various end-use sectors, particularly industry, improvements in end-use efficiency and lower than average heat consumption as a result of favorable climatic conditions, particularly in 2011 and 2014. In 2014, the EU-28 met its 2020 target for final energy consumption.       Between 2005 and 2014, final energy consumption in some non-EU EEA countries, namely Turkey, Iceland and Norway, increased by 28 % (2.8 % per year). This difference was caused by an increase in energy consumption in Turkey (35 %) and Iceland (78 %), and a small decrease in energy consumption in Norway (1 %). Since 1990, the final energy consumption in these non-EU EEA countries has increased by 92 % (2.8 % annually).       Final energy consumption in the EEA-33 countries decreased by 8.4 % (1 % annually) between 2005 and 2014. The largest contributors to this decrease were the industry and household sectors, bothcontributing 13.6 % to this decrease. On average, each person in the EEA-33 countries used 2.0 tonnes of oil equivalent to meet their energy needs in 2014.    fuels energy consumption natural gas electricity ghg retrospective solid fuels energy cosumption electriciy energy         CSI CSI027 ENER ENER016 027 016, Between 2005 and 2014, final energy consumption decreased by 11 % (1.3 % annually) in the EU-28 (Figure 1) and by 8.4 % (1.0 % annually) in the EEA-33 countries. Between 2013 and 2014, final energy consumption decreased (see Table 1) by 4.1 % in the EU-28 and 3.5 % in the EEA-33 countries. The difference in the reduction in final energy consumption between the EEA-33 and the EU-28 is mainly as a result of the increase in energy consumption in Turkey (35 %) and Iceland (78 %) between 2005 and 2014. In Iceland, this increase was mainly caused by an increase in the production capacity of the aluminium industry. In Norway, final energy consumption decreased by 1 % between 2005 and 2014. With regard to final energy consumption per sector (see Figure 1), final energy consumption in the industry sector has decreased by 16.5 % in the EU-28 (13.6 % in the EEA-33) since 2005, in the household sector it has decreased by 14.8 % in the EU-28 (13.6 % in the EEA-33), in the transport sector it has decreased by 4.6 % in the EU-28 (1.6 % in the EEA-33), and in the 'Fishing, agriculture and forestry' and 'Non-specified' sectors it has decreased by 27.9 % in the EU-28 (22.5 % in the EEA-33). In the services sector, final energy consumption has decreased by 1.7 % in the EU-28 since 2005, but it has increased by 2.4 % in the EEA-33. Over the whole period (19902014), the largest increases in final energy consumption in the EU-28 occurred in the services and transport sectors, with increases of 30 % and 24 %, respectively (38 % and 28 %, respectively, in the EEA-33). Between 2005 and 2014, energy consumption in the industry sector fell at an average annual rate of 2.0 %. This was largely the result of a shift towards less energy-intensive manufacturing industries and the continuing transition to a more service-oriented European economy, combined with the effects of the economic recession in recent years. This trend in decreasing energy consumption in industry is expected to continue in the future because of ongoing industry reallocation which could lead to a permanently smaller manufacturing sector in the EU. Between 2005 and 2014, energy consumption in the services sector decreased annually by 0.2 %. This sector is growing in Europe and so is the demand for energy for electrical appliances, particularly those related to information and communication technologies, such as computers, and other energy-intensive technologies, such as heating and air conditioning. Overall, however, the energy consumption in this sector has been more or less stable. Between 2005 and 2014, energy consumption in the transport sector decreased annually by 0.5 %. This decrease, observed since 2007, was due to energy savings in road transport. This is the result of improvements in fuel efficiency, as a result of vehicle emission standards, which have been offset by increases in passenger and freight transport demand. Higher transport demand has resulted from an increase in the ownership of private cars, particularly in the new EU Member States, as well as an increase in settlement and urban sprawl which have led to people travelling longer distances, and changes in lifestyle. For more details on trends in the transport sector, see EEA, 2015a, and TERM001. In 2014, the transport sector accounted for 33 % of total final energy consumption in the EU-28 Member States, followed by the industrial sector (26 %), the household sector (25 %) and the services sector (13 %) (see Figure 1). The observed trend in final energy consumption differs significantly across the EEA member countries (see Table 1). Between 2005 and 2014, Iceland, Malta and Turkey experienced, by far, the largest increases in final energy consumption (78 %, 42 % and 35 %, respectively), whereas Greece and Spain experienced the largest decreases (26 % and 19 %, respectively). In addition, final energy consumption also decreased significantly in Hungary (18 %), Portugal (17 %), Italy (17 %), Ireland (15 %) and the United Kingdom (15 %) during this period. Large increases in final energy consumption correlate with growing economies (e.g. Turkey) and growing industry (e.g. Iceland). The decreases in final energy consumption are mainly the result of energy savings (in Ireland and the United Kingdom), in combination with a decrease in economic activity (Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain). Between 2005 and 2014, the consumption of oil decreased by 16.1 % (1.9 % annually) (see Figures 2 and 6). The largest decrease, of 45.1 %, was in the industry sector. The smallest decrease, of 7.8 %, occurred in the transport sector. Between 2005 and 2014, the final consumption of electricity decreased by 2.8 % (0.3 % annually) (see Figures 3 and 6). Since 2005, electricity consumption in the services sector continued to increase (by 10 %), while, over the same period, electricity consumption decreased by 12 % in the industry sector and 2 % in the household sector. Electricity consumption in industry decreased mainly because of a decrease in activity in the sector and an increase in energy savings. The consumption of electricity in the household sector has been more or less stable since 2005. An increase in the number of dwellings has been balanced by an increase in the energy efficiency of lighting, electrical appliances, and electrical heating and cooling systems. The increase in the consumption of electricity in the services sector is because of the Europe-wide growth of the sector. Between 2005 and 2014, the consumption of natural gas decreased by 18.6 % (2.3 % annually) (see Figures 4 and 6). Natural gas consumption in the households and services sectors has, on average, decreased as a result of improvements in the thermal performance of buildings, but this has been offset, to a certain extent, by an increase in the number of houses and buildings. Between 2005 and 2014, natural gas consumption decreasedby 22.1 % in the household sector and 5.3 % in the services sector. In 2014, the household sector accounted for the largest proportion of the final energy consumption of natural gas (42 %) in the EU-28. This was a result of the increase in the use of gas for residential heating and cooking. Consequently, the trend in natural gas consumption shows relatively large year-to-year variations due to weather conditions: natural gas consumption increased in 2010 because of cold winter conditions and decreased in 2011 and 2014because of mild winter conditions. Between 2005 and 2014, the consumption of solid fuels decreased by 13.7 % (1.6 % annually) (see Figures 5 and 6). In absolute terms, this reduction occurred mainly in the industry sector. The decrease of solid fuel consumption in the households sector stopped in 2000. However, year-to-year variations occur because of weather conditions. "
"energy-efficiency-and-specific-co2-9  Energy efficiency and specific CO2 emissions      Specific CO  2   emissions from the road transport sector have decreased since 2000, mainly because of past improvements in the fuel efficiency of passenger cars. An EU regulation sets emission performance standards for new passenger cars, which is expected to further reduce CO  2   emissions as a result of emission targets of 130 g/km and 95 g/km targets that it sets for 2015 and 2021, respectively. A separate regulationsetsemission standardsfor light commercial vehicles (vans), with a 2017 target of 175g CO 2 /km and147g CO 2 /km by 2020.     Although decreasing, the   CO  2   emissions from the air transport sector are still considerably higher than those from road transport, while rail remains the most energy efficient mode of passenger transport.     The specific energy efficiency of light and heavy duty trucks has improved slightly since 2000, but road transport still consumes significantly more energy per tonne-kilometre (tkm) than rail or ship freight transport. CO  2   emissions from light commercial vehicles are also expected to decrease in view of the   emission targets of   175 g/km and 147 g/km set for 2015 and 2020, respectively.      co2 greenhouse gas emissions cars transport indicators passenger transport freight transport co2 emissions passenger cars road transport transport term 027           TERM TERM027 027,Between 2000 and 2014, the specific CO2 emissions of the road transport sector decreased by 10.3 % for passenger transport and by 9 % for freight transport. The energy efficiency and CO2 per passenger-kilometre (pkm) of passenger cars improved by 10.4 % over the same period, somewhat as a result of an early (now discontinued) voluntary agreement made by the automotive manufacturing industries, but more significantly following the introduction of the EU regulation (No. 443/2009). The reductions in road freight transport are because of technical improvements in light- and heavy-duty trucks (mainly in engine efficiency) and the increased activity of heavy-duty trucks (i.e. higher load factors). Between 2000 and 2014, the combined effect of improvements in aircraft technology and increased load factors resulted in an overall decrease in the specific CO2 emissions from the air passenger transport sector of 17.9 %. Transport volumes and total emissions reached a peak in 2002 and have decreased slightly since then. Rail is by far the most energy efficient mode of passenger transport. The specific CO2 emissions from the rail transport sector have decreased by about 54 % from 2005 to 2014 for passenger transport and by about 27 % for freight transport, mainly because of a shift from diesel to electric trains.,In the EU-28, CO2 emissions from the new passenger car fleet fell from 123.4 g to 119.5 g between 2014 and 2015, a decrease of 3.9 g CO2/km. The new passenger car fleet met the emission target of 130 g CO2/km set for 2015 two years early, but additional efforts are still required to meet the future target of 95 g CO2/km by 2020.The average mass of new passenger cars registered in the EU-28 has returned to 2010/2011 levels. The average mass of new cars sold in the EU (i.e. 1 381 kg) remained broadly the same in 2015 as in 2014. However,new cars are becoming more efficient; the average car sold in 2015 was almost 15 % more efficient than the average car sold in 2010. The average van registered in 2015 emitted 168.3 g CO2/km, 0.9 g less than in 2014. While the reported annual reduction is small, emissions are nevertheless well below the EUs 2017 target of 175 g CO2/km. This target was already met in 2013. Vans are also becoming more efficient; the average van sold in 2015 was more than 6 % more efficient than the average van sold in 2012. Further efficiency improvements still need to be achieved to reach the EUs more stringent target of 147 g CO2/km set for 2020."
"assessment  Hail     Hail events are among the most costly weather-related extreme events in several European regions, causing substantial damage to crops, vehicles, buildings and other infrastructure.   The number of hail events is highest in mountainous areas and pre-Alpine regions. Since 1951, increasing hail trends have been noted in southern France and Austria, and decreasing (but not statistically significant) trends have been noted in parts of eastern Europe.   Future projections of hail events are subject to large uncertainties, because small-scale hail events cannot be directly represented in global and regional climate models. However, model-based studies for central Europe show some agreement that hailstorm frequency will increase in this region.     climate change key climate variables  CLIM CLIM053 053,Past trends Trends in days with hail have been calculated using surface-based observations, but are unreliable owing to the limited number of stations and the stochastic nature of hailstorms [i]. Trends in hail observations are sometimes analysed using reports of damage as a proxy (e.g. insurance claims), although damage is also a function of the vulnerability of the impacted area to damage. Several European regions show an increase in the convective conditions that can potentially form hail. In some areas (such as south-west Germany), an increase in damage days is observed [ii]. However, these changes are not uniform across Europe, with large regional differences mostly related to topography. A study of hailstorm frequencies over the period 19782009 in Germany and eastern Europe shows general increases in convective available potential energy (CAPE) and increases in evaporation, which have been attributed to rising temperatures, but the changes in these weather variables do not necessary modify the numbers and intensities of severe convective storms [iii]. The atmosphere has become more unstable, and thus more suitable for hail, especially in southern and central Europe, where the temperature increase in summer has been particularly large[iv]. Recently, European hail climatology for the period 19512010 was analysed using a combination of various meteorological parameters relevant for thunderstorms and hail[v]. This has been expressed as the potential hail index (PHI), which quantifies the atmospheric potential for hailstorms. The climatology shows the highest values of the mean PHI for the areas north and south of the Alps, the eastern Adriatic coast and parts of eastern Europe (Figure 1 left). Increasing hail trends (with a PHI over 3 in the period 19512010) are found in southern France and Spain, and decreasing trends (with a PHI lower than 5 in the period 19512010) in eastern Europe (Figure 1 right). However, trends are not significant (at the 5% significance level) in most grid boxes. Projections Much of the published work relevant to future hail projections is based upon developing the relationships between large-scale atmospheric environments and small-scale severe weather events, such as severe thunderstorms, hailstorms and tornadoes. Available projections suggest increases in CAPE, which result in conditions that favour severe thunderstorms becoming more frequent, and decreases in wind shear, which reduces the likelihood of hailstorms [vi]. Different RCMs have been used for assessing changes in hailstorms at the national and sub-national scales. A statistically significant downwards trend for hailstones with diameters between 21 and 50mm was projected for the United Kingdom [vii]. An increase in hailstorm frequency between 7 and 15% for the period 20312045 compared with 19712000 was projected for south-west Germany based on large-scale weather patterns [viii]. Using the PHI and an ensemble of seven RCMs, an increase in hail probability over most areas of Germany was projected for the period 20212050 compared with 19712000 [ix]. The projected changes are largest in southern Germany (values of almost 7 PHI). However, the results are subject to large uncertainties, mainly owing to low spatial resolution and convective parametrisation schemes in regional climate models [x]. Improving the convective parametrisation schemes and increasing the spatial resolution of models would improve the accuracy of future hail projections.   [i] H. J. Punge and M.

"assessment  Wind storms     Storm location, frequency and intensity have shown considerable decadal variability across Europe over the past century, such that no significant long-term trends are apparent.   Recent studies on changes in winter storm tracks generally project an extension eastwards of the North Atlantic storm track towards central Europe and the British Isles.   Climate change simulations show diverging projections on changes in the number of winter storms across Europe. However, most studies agree that the risk of severe winter storms, and possibly of severe autumn storms, will increase for the North Atlantic and northern, north-western and central Europe over the 21st century.     europe climate change projection wind speed    CLIM CLIM005 005,Past trends Studies of past changes in extra-tropical storms have used a variety of methods, making it difficult to compare the results of different studies or to assess if there is any underlying trend in climate change. Storm location and intensity in Europe has shown considerable variation over the past century, but Northern Hemisphere storm tracks and intensity have likely shifted northwards since at least 1970 [i]. Wind data at the local or regional levels can show a series of decreases and increases continuing over several decades. Long records of wind speed for various regions across Europe indicate that storm intensity (i.e. storminess) has not significantly changed over the past 200 years. Available studies of storminess in north-western Europe indicate relatively high levels during the 1880s, followed by below-average conditions between the 1930s and 1960s, a pronounced increase in storminess until the mid-1990s, and average or below-average activity afterwards. Somewhat similar patterns were observed in other parts of Europe [ii]. There is low confidence in the robustness of reanalysis results for extreme wind speeds before the middle of the 20th century [iii]. A single reanalysis study for the period 18712008 suggests an increasing trend in storminess across western, central and northern Europe, with storminess in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea region reaching its highest values towards the end of the 20th century [iv]. Other studies have produced evidence that both conflicts and agrees with this result [v]. Projections The simulation of extra-tropical cyclones in climate models remains a scientific challenge in spite of recent significant progress in modelling techniques. Earlier model studies showed shifts both polewards [vi] and towards the equator [vii] in the Atlantic storm track. The latter could double the predicted increase in winter rainfall over western and central Europe compared with other climate projections. Recent simulations based on CMIP5 data project an extension eastwards of the North Atlantic storm track towards central Europe and the British Isles [viii]. Modelling studies show diverging results on changes in the number of storms across Europe, but they generally agree on increases in the strongest, most damaging storms in most European regions. A study using a multi-model ensemble projects a small increase in the wind speed of the strongest winter storms over northern parts of central and western Europe, and a decrease in southern Europe (Figure 1) [ix]. The associated change in mean potential economic loss varied between 7% in the Iberian Peninsula and +25% in Germany. A comprehensive review study covering the North Atlantic and northern, north-western and central Europe shows large agreement that the intensity of winter storms will increase in all these regions over the 21st century [x]. Another recent study focusing on central Europe concluded that models consistently projected an increased frequency and intensity of severe storms over central Europe. Under SRES A1B conditions, increases in frequency towards the end of the 21st century range between 11% and +44%, with an ensemble average of 21% [xi]. The intensity of storms affecting central Europe once a year was found to increase by about +30%, with individual models projecting changes between 28% and up to +96%. These results are largely consistent with those of a recent study based on the GCM projections underlying the IPCCAR5 [xii]. One recent study with a single, very high-resolution (~25km) GCM indicates that the frequency and intensity in Europe of severe autumn storms originating in the tropical Atlantic will increase in a warmer future climate as will the area affected [xiii]. However, this result cannot be considered robust, as it has not yet been confirmed by other studies. In summary, the risk of severe winter storms, and possibly of severe autumn storms, is projected to increase in many regions in Europe, in particular for the North Atlantic and northern, north-western and central Europe.

"assessment  Heavy precipitation     The intensity of heavy precipitation events in summer and winter have increased in northern and north-eastern Europe since the 1960s. Different indices show diverging trends for south-western and southern Europe.   Heavy precipitation events are likely to become more frequent in most parts of Europe. The projected changes are strongest in Scandinavia and eastern Europe in winter.     climate change key climate variables heavy precipitation   CLIM CLIM004 004,Past trends The majority of observation-based studies that investigate trends in extreme rainfall intensity are based on data recorded at the daily time scale. An index for the maximum annual precipitation over five consecutive days (Rx5d) shows significant increases up to 5mm per decade over northern and north-western Europe in winters and up to 4mm in summers (Figure 1 left). The same index shows decreases of more than 5mm per decade in south-western Europe in winter and between 2 and 3mm in summer (Figure 1 right). The smaller trends in central and south-eastern Europe are not statistically significant. The increase in northern and north-eastern Europe is a consequence of the observed shift polewards of the North Atlantic storm track and weakening of Mediterranean storms [i]. A wider literature review suggests that heavy precipitation events have become more intense and more frequent in Europe on average, but there are important differences across regions, seasons, time periods, heavy precipitation indices and underlying datasets. Studies generally agree that heavy precipitation has become more intense in northern and north-eastern Europe since the 1950s, even though not all changes are statistically significant. Different studies and indices show diverging trends for south-western and southern Europe. Records of daily mean precipitation are often insufficient to study trends and changes in heavy precipitation. The damage associated with heavy precipitation often originates from sub-daily localised heavy precipitation events, which can lead to costly flash floods. Owing to limited data availability, only a limited number of studies have focused on large regional scale assessments of sub-daily precipitation [ii]. A recent review study concludes that extreme sub-daily precipitation events have generally increased in Europe, even in regions with decreases in mean rainfall, but there is large variability across regions, seasons and event durations [iii]. Projections Global warming is projected to lead to a higher intensity of precipitation and longer dry periods in Europe [iv]. Projections show an increase in heavy daily precipitation in most parts of Europe in winter, by up to 35% during the 21st century. Heavy precipitation in winter is projected to increase over most of Europe, with increases of up to 30% in north-eastern Europe (Figure 2 left). In summer, an increase is also projected in most parts of Europe, but decreases are projected for some regions in southern and south-western Europe (Figure 2 right) [v]. Similar patterns were found for other heavy precipitation indices [vi]. The continued increase in the spatial and temporal resolution of global and regional climate models has generally improved the representation of extreme precipitation and increased confidence in model-based projections [vii]. However, regional climate models with spatial resolutions of between 10 and 30km typically used in climate change studies are still too coarse to explicitly represent sub-daily localised heavy precipitation events [viii]. Evidence from high-resolution climate models suggests that the intensity of sub-daily extreme rainfall is likely to increase in the future, whereby an increase of (theoretically estimated) ~7% per C appears most likely in many regions [ix]. A very high-resolution model (typically 15km) used for weather forecasts with explicit convection has recently been used for a climate change experiment for a region in the United Kingdom. This study projects intensification of short-duration heavy rain in the summer, with significantly more events exceeding the high thresholds indicative of serious flash flooding [x].

"assessment  Soil moisture     Harmonised in situ data on soil moisture are not available across the EU. Modelled soil moisture content has significantly decreased in the Mediterranean region and increased in parts of northern Europe since the 1950s, as a result of past warming and precipitation changes.   Significant decreases in summer soil moisture content in the Mediterranean region and increases in north-eastern Europe are projected for the coming decades.     soil moisture climate emissions trends and projections trends    LSI LSI007 007,Past trends As a spatially and temporally comprehensive set of harmonised soil moisture data over a sufficient soil depth is not available, assessments of past trends in soil moisture rely on hydrological models driven by data on climate, soil characteristics, land cover and phenological phases. These simulations take account of changes in available energy, humidity and wind speed, but disregard artificial drainage and irrigation practices. Modelling of soil moisture content over the past 60 years suggests that there has been little change at the global and pan-European levels [i]. At the sub-continental scale, however, significant trends in summer soil moisture content can be observed (Figure 1). Soil moisture content has increased in parts of northern Europe, probably because of increases in precipitation amounts. In contrast, soil moisture has decreased in most of the Mediterranean region, particularly in south-eastern Europe, south-western Europe and southern France. The substantial increases in soil moisture content modelled over western Turkey should be considered with caution because of the limited availability of climate and soil data in the region, which affects the accuracy of the modelled trends [ii]. Projections Based on the results of 12 RCMs, the projected changes in soil moisture anomaly (Palmer Drought Severity Index) show a strong latitudinal gradient, from pronounced drier conditions in southern Europe to wetter conditions in northern European regions in all seasons (Figure 2). The largest changes in the soil moisture index between 20212050 and the baseline period (19611990) are projected for the summer period in the Mediterranean, especially in north-eastern Spain and south-eastern Europe [iii]. Projections for the end of the 21st century show significant decreases in summer soil moisture content in the Mediterranean region and central Europe, and increases in the north-eastern part of Europe [iv].

"assessment  Water- and food-borne diseases     It is not possible to assess whether past climate change has already affected water- and food-borne diseases in Europe, but the sensitivity of pathogens to climate factors suggest that climate change could be having effects on these diseases.   The number of vibriosis infections, which can be life-threatening, has increased substantially in Baltic Sea states since 1980. This increase has been linked to observed increases in sea surface temperature, which has improved environmental conditions for Vibrio species blooms in marine waters. The unprecedented number of vibriosis infections in 2014 has been attributed to the unprecedented 2014 heat wave in the Baltic region.   Increased temperatures could increase the risk of salmonellosis.   The risk of campylobacteriosis and cryptosporidiosis could increase in those regions where precipitation or extreme flooding is projected to increase.   Climate change can have an impact on food safety hazards throughout the food chain.     baltic sea climate change health infections    CLIM CLIM038 038,Vibrio species (non-cholera) Brackish water and elevated ambient temperature are ideal environmental growth conditions for certainVibriospecies. These conditions can be found during the summer months in estuaries and enclosed water bodies with moderate salinity, such as the Baltic Sea. In contrast, open ocean environments do not offer appropriate growth conditions for these bacteria owing to the high salt content, lower temperature and limited nutrient content. Of the most relevance to human health are theVibriospecies that can cause vibriosis infections, includingVibrio parahaemolyticus,Vibrio vulnificusand the non-toxigenicVibrio cholerae. Elevated levels of non-choleraVibriospecies infections have been observed during extended hot summer seasons with water temperatures above 20C in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea [i]. The availability of data is best for the Baltic Sea region, where a recent analysis found strong links between the temporal and spatial peaks in sea surface temperatures and the number and distribution of Vibrio infections. Figure 1 shows the observed and projected levels of Vibrio infections in the Baltic Sea region from 1982 to 2010, which was a period of unprecedented sea surface temperature warming [ii]. Increased numbers of infections can be expected based on the effects of increased temperatures under climate change scenarios. Figure 2 presents Vibrio risk maps for 2006 (left) and 2050 under elevated sea surface temperature (right). The projected increase in risk is substantial, but the absolute increase is projected to be modest owing to low current incidence rates. More recent studies in this region suggest that this warming trend has continued, with the July 2014 heat wave experienced in Sweden and Finland leading to an unprecedented number of Vibrio wound infections reported in the region, many at extremely high latitudes (e.g. >65N) [iii]. Environmentally acquired Vibrio infections in humans associated with particularly high sea surface temperatures have also been reported along the North Sea coast of Europe in recent years [iv]. Bacterial Vibrioblooms in coastal water can be monitored on the E3 Geoportal developed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [v]. The tool uses daily updated remotely sensed data to examine environmentally suitable conditions forVibrio species in coastal waters internationally. Cryptosporidium Cryptosporidiosis is an acute diarrhoeal disease caused by intracellular protozoan parasites, Cryptosporidiumspecies. Transmission is through the faecaloral route via contaminated water, soil or food products, and the most commonly identified vehicles are contaminated drinking water and contaminated recreational water. For example, several days of heavy rain in June 2013 resulted in river flooding in eastern Germany, and activities in the dried out floodplain led to infection among children [vi]. Heavy rainfall has also been associated with the contamination of water supplies and outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis [vii], as the concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts in river water increases significantly during rainfall events. Dry weather conditions preceding a heavy rain event have also been associated with drinking water outbreaks [viii]. Thus, heavy precipitation can result in the persistence of oocysts in the water distribution system and the infiltration of drinking water reservoirs from springs and lakes. Inadequate barriers to remove or inactivate Cryptosporidium in the public water supply have in the past resulted in a large outbreak of Cryptosporidium in Sweden [ix]. Campylobacter In Europe, campylobacteriosis is the most common bacterial cause of diarrhoeal disease. The association of campylobacteriosis with a number of weather-related factors, such as temperature, rainfall, humidity and sunshine is inconsistent and lacks a clear explanatory mechanism, as Campylobacterdoes not replicate outside its animal host. There is a clear seasonality to the data in a number of European countries, with more cases during the summer months, and an association with the ambient temperature that preceded the diagnosis of the cases by 10 to 14 weeks [x]. Temperature has also been found to be linked to cases in a number of studies from England and Wales [xi] but not in other countries [xii]. Rain in early spring can trigger campylobacteriosis outbreaks [xiii]. With the projected increase in heavy rainfall events in northern Europe, the risk of surface and groundwater contamination is expected to rise. Climate change might increase the use of rainwater for irrigation or drinking water during times of drought in certain locations. Norovirus Norovirus is the most common cause of viral diarrhoea in humans with a pronounced winter seasonality. Food-borne norovirus outbreaks have been linked to climate and weather events; for example, heavy rainfall and floods may lead to wastewater overflow which can contaminate shellfish farming sites. Flood water has been associated with a norovirus outbreak in Austria [xiv]. In Europe, norovirus season strength was positively associated with average rainfall in the wettest month [xv]. Water-borne transmission of the virus is probably influenced by rainfall, causing norovirus seasonality [xvi]. The magnitude of rainfall has also been related to viral contamination of the marine environment and with peaks in diarrhoea incidence [xvii]. The predicted increase of heavy rainfall events under climate change scenarios could lead to an increase in norovirus infections because floods are known to be linked to norovirus outbreaks. Salmonella Salmonellosis is the second most commonly reported gastrointestinal infection and an important cause of food-borne outbreaks in Europe. However, overall reported cases of salmonellosis have declined steadily for several years in Europe, in part because of control measures implemented in poultry production. An increase in weekly temperature has been associated with an increase in salmonellosis in different settings [xviii]. Seasonal temperatures have been linked to salmonellosis cases, but public health interventions can attenuate the effect of warmer temperature. Extreme precipitation events that result in faecal contamination events have also been associated with salmonellosis [xix]. Floods caused by heavy rainfall events may disrupt water treatment and sewage systems and contribute to increased exposure toSalmonella species and other pathogens. Available climate change projections indicate that the average annual number of temperature-related cases of salmonellosis in Europe may increase by almost 20000 by the 2020s, in addition to increases expected from population changes. Under a high emissions scenario, climate change could result in up to 50% more temperature-related cases by the end of the 21st century than would be expected on the basis of population change alone. However, these estimates are associated with high uncertainty [xx]. Moreover, health promotion and food safety policies can mitigate adverse impacts on public health.   [i] C. J.

"assessment-2  Global and European sea level     Global mean sea level has risen by 19.5cm from 1901 to 2015, at an average rate of 1.7mm/year, but with significant decadal variation. The rate of sea level rise since 1993, when satellite measurements have been available, has been higher, at around 3mm/year. Global mean sea level in 2015 was the highest yearly average over the record and ~70 mm higher than in 1993.   Evidence for a predominant role of anthropogenic climate change in the observed global mean sea level rise and for an acceleration during recent decades has strengthened since the publication of the IPCCAR5.   Most coastal regions in Europe have experienced an increase in absolute sea level and in sea level relative to land, but there is significant regional variation.   Extreme high coastal water levels have increased at most locations along the European coastline. This increase appears to be predominantly due to increases in mean local sea level rather than to changes in storm activity.   Global mean sea level rise during the 21st century will very likely occur at a higher rate than during the period 19712010. Process-based models considered in the IPCCAR5 project a rise in sea level over the 21st century that is likely in the range of 0.260.54m for a low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) and 0.450.81m for a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5). However, several recent studies suggest substantially higher values. Several national assessments, expert assessments and recent model-based studies have suggested an upper bound for 21st century global mean sea level rise in the range of 1.52.0m.   Available process-based models project that global mean sea level rise by 2300 will be less than 1m for greenhouse gas concentrations that peak and decline and do not exceed 500ppm CO 2 -equivalent, but will be in the range of 1m to more than 3m for concentrations above 700ppm CO 2 -equivalent. However, these models are likely to systematically underestimate the sea level contribution from Antarctica, and some recent studies suggest substantially higher rates of sea level rise in the coming centuries.   The rise in sea level relative to land along most European coasts is projected to be similar to the global average, with the exception of the northern Baltic Sea and the northern Atlantic Coast, which are experiencing considerable land rise as a consequence of post-glacial rebound.   Projected increases in extreme high coastal water levels are likely to mostly be the result of increases in local relative mean sea level in most locations. However, recent studies suggest that increases in the meteorologically driven surge component can also play a substantial role, in particular along the northern European coastline.     greenland ice sheet climate change oceans antartic ice sheet sea level coast glaciers flooding extreme events         CSI CSI047 CLIM CLIM012 047 012,Past trends: extreme sea level along the European coastline Producing a clear picture of either past changes or future projections of extreme high water levels for the entire European coastline is a challenging task because of the impact of local topographical features on surge events. While there are numerous studies for the North Sea coastline, fewer are available for the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea, although this situation is starting to improve. Extreme sea levels show pronounced short- and long-term variability. A recent review of extreme sea level trends along European coasts concluded that long-term trends are mostly associated with the corresponding mean sea level changes. Changes in wave and storm surge climate mostly contribute to interannual and decadal variability, but do not show substantial long-term trends [i]. When the contribution from local mean sea level changes and variations in tide are removed from the recent trends, the remaining effects of changes in storminess on extreme sea level are much smaller or even no longer detectable [ii]. Additional studies are available for some European coastal locations, but these typically focus on more limited spatial scales [iii]. The only region where significant increases in storm surge height were found during the 20th century is the Estonian coast of the Baltic Sea [iv]. In conclusion, while there have been detectable changes in extreme water levels around the European coastline, most of these are the result of changes in local mean sea level. The contribution from changes in storminess is currently small in most European locations and there is little evidence that any trends can be separated from long-term natural variability. Projections: extreme sea level at the European coastline Future projections of extreme sea level can be made using either process-based (dynamic) or empirical statistical modelling of storm surge behaviour driven by the output of global climate models [v]. Uncertainty in these projections for Europe remains high and is ultimately linked to the uncertainty in future mid-latitude storminess changes. This is an area where current scientific understanding is advancing quickly, as climate model representations of aspects of Northern Hemisphere storm track behaviour are showing improvements associated with, for instance, greater ocean and atmosphere resolution. However, the newest global climate models have not yet, typically, been downscaled to suitably fine scales and used in studies of future storm surges [vi]. It has generally been expected that projected increases in extreme sea level along the European coast during the upcoming decades will mostly be the result of mean sea level changes rather than changes in wave and storm surge climate [vii]. However, several recent studies suggest that changes in wave and storm surge climate may also play a substantial role in sea level changes during the 21st century in some regions. One recent study based on a multi-model ensemble projects an increase in storm surge level for most scenarios and return periods along the northern European coastline, which is more prominent for RCP8.5 than for RCP 4.5, and which can exceed 30% of the relative sea level rise. Storm surge levels along most European coastal areas south of 50N showed small changes [viii]. Similar results were obtained by another study, which found that increases in storm surges can contribute significantly to the projected increases of the 50-year flood height in north-western Europe, particularly along the European mainland coast [ix]. Sea level rise may also change extreme water levels by altering the tidal range. Tidal behaviour is particularly responsive in resonant areas of the Bristol Channel and the Gulf of Saint-Malo (with large amplitude decreases) and in the south-eastern German Bight and Dutch Wadden Sea (with large amplitude increases) [x]. The frequency of flooding events is estimated to increase by more than a factor of 10 in many European locations, and by a factor of more than 100 in some locations (Figure6) for the RCP4.5 scenario [xi]. Large changes in flood frequency mean that what is an extreme event today may become the norm by the end of the century in some locations. A 10cm rise in sea level typically causes an increase by about a factor of three in the frequency of flooding to a given height. However, for any particular location, it is important to look in detail at the change in the height of flood defences that might be required. Where the flood frequency curve is very flat, modest increases in flood defences be sufficient. Where the flood frequency curve is steeper, larger increases in protection height or alternative adaptation, including managed retreat, might be needed.

Many tide gauge measurements have long multi-decade time series, with some exceeding more than 100years. However, the results can be distorted by various local effects. Satellite altimeters enable sea level to be measured from space and give much better spatial coverage (except at high latitudes). However, the length of the altimeter record is limited to only about two decades. The IPCCAR5 estimated that GMSL rose by 19.5cm in the period between 1901 and 2015, which corresponds to an average rate of around 1.7mm/year (Figure1). This rate is somewhat higher than the sum of the known contributions to sea level rise over this period [i]. This value has been confirmed by more recent studies [ii]. One reanalysis suggests that GMSL during the 20th century rose at a lower rate of 1.20.2mm/year [iii], but this reanalysis has been criticised for its non-representative selection of tide gauges [iv]. Evidence from formal detection and attribution studies showing that most of the observed increase in GMSL since the 1950s can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change has increased since the publication of the IPCCAR5 [v]. All estimates for the rate of GMSL rise during the period since 1993, for which satellite-based measurements are available, are considerably higher than the 20th century trend, at 2.63.2mm/year [vi]. Different statistical methods for assessing sea level trends and changes therein can come to somewhat different conclusions [vii]. However, available assessments agree that an acceleration in the rate of GMSL rise since the early 1990s is detectable, despite significant decadal variation. Global mean sea level in 2015 was the highest yearly average over the record and ~70 mm higher than in 1993 [viii]. The causes of GMSL rise over recent decades are now reasonably well understood. Thermal expansion and melting of glaciers account for around 75% of the measured sea level rise since 1971. The contribution from melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets has increased since the early 1990s. Changes in land water storage have made only a small contribution, but the rate of groundwater extraction has increased recently and now exceeds the rate of storage in reservoirs [ix]. A recent study concludes that climate-driven variability in precipitation has resulted in increased water storage on land, and that global sea level rise in the period 20022014 would have been 1520% higher in the absence of this climate variability [x]. Past trends: mean sea level along the European coastline Sea level measurements for the European region are available from satellite altimeter observations (Figure2) and from tide gauges (Figure3). Satellite observations, which show changes in absolute sea level, are available from 1993. Tide gauge records can be more than 100years long; they show changes in relative sea level considering also land changes, which is more relevant for coastal protection than absolute sea level. Most European coastal regions experience increases in both absolute and relative sea level, but there are sizeable differences between the rates of absolute and relative sea level change across Europe. Figure2 shows linear trends in absolute sea level from 1992 to 2014 as observed by satellites. The main differences between regional seas and basins are primarily the result of different physical processes being the dominant cause of sea level change at different locations. For instance, the Mediterranean Sea is a semi-closed, very deep basin, exchanging water with the Atlantic Ocean through only the narrow Gibraltar Strait. Salinity in the Mediterranean Sea may increase in the future and this will tend to offset rises in sea level due to thermal expansion from warming. The NAO, interannual wind variability, changes in ocean circulation patterns, and the location of large-scale gyres and small-scale eddies are further factors that can influence local sea level in the European seas. Obviously, sea level changes in coastal zones are most relevant for society. Figure3 shows linear trends in relative sea level from 1970 to 2014 as observed by tide gauge stations in Europe. These trends can differ from those measured by satellites because of the longer time period covered and because tide gauge measurements are influenced by vertical land movement whereas satellite measurements are not. In particular, since the last ice age, the lands around the northern Baltic Sea have been, and are still, rising owing to the post-glacial rebound [xi]. Projections: global mean sea level Currently, there are two main approaches to projecting future sea level. Process-based models represent the most important known physical processes explicitly, whereas empirical statistical models look at the relationship between temperature (or radiative forcing) and sea level that has been observed in the past and extrapolate it into the future. A significant recent step forwards in projecting future sea levels is the improved understanding of the contributing factors to recently observed sea level rise, which has increased confidence in the use of process-based models for projecting the future [xii]. The IPCCAR5 concludes that the rate of GMSL rise during the 21st century will very likely exceed the rate observed in the period 19712010 for all emissions scenarios. Process-based models estimate the rise in GMSL for the period 20812100, compared with 19862005, to be likely in the range of 0.260.54m for RCP2.6, 0.320.62m for RCP4.5, 0.330.62m for RCP6.0 and 0.450.81m for RCP8.5. For RCP8.5, the rise in GMSL by 2100 is projected to be in the range of 0.530.97m, with a rate during 20812100 of 715mm/year. Based on current understanding, only a collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (i.e. those areas where the bed lies well below sea level and the edges flow into floating ice shelves) could cause GMSL to rise substantially (by up to several tenths of a metre) above the likely range projected for the 21st century, but the evidence is insufficient for estimating the likelihood of such a collapse (Figure4). Projections of sea level rise from recent empirical statistical models calibrated with newly available sea level reconstructions align with those from current process-based models [xiii]. Some recent studies highlight the contributions to recent sea level rise from ice sheet melting that were not included in the process-based models underlying the AR5 estimates above [xiv]. A broad expert assessment of future sea level rise resulted in higher estimates than those from the process-based models reviewed in the AR5. The best expert estimates for sea level rise during the 21st century were 0.40.6m for the low forcing scenario (RCP2.6) and 0.71.2m for the high forcing scenario (RCP8.5) [xv]. Similar results were derived in other recent studies [xvi]. A study that combined the model-based assessments from the AR5 with updated models and probabilistic expert assessment of the sea level contributions from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets suggests an upper limit for GMSL rise during the 21st century of 180cm, which has a 5% probability of being exceeded under the RCP8.5 forcing scenario [xvii]. Various national reports have also used values in the range of 1.52.0m as upper estimates for GMSL rise during the 21st century. One recent study suggests that ice sheet melting in Antarctica and Greenland could occur much faster than previously assumed, which would result in sea level rise of several metres during the 21st century [xviii], but these findings have been controversial. These high-end scenarios are somewhat speculative, but their consideration is nevertheless important for long-term coastal risk management, in particular in densely populated coastal zones [xix]. Sea level rise will continue far beyond 2100. Based on a limited number of available simulations with process-based models, the AR5 suggests that the GMSL rise by 2300 will be less than 1m for greenhouse gas concentrations that do not exceed 500ppm CO2-equivalent, but will be in the range of 1m to more than 3m for concentrations above 700ppm CO2-equivalent. However, the AR5 also considered it likely that the underlying models systematically underestimate Antarcticas future contribution to sea level rise [xx]. Estimates for GMSL rise beyond 2100 from the above-mentioned expert assessment are broadly comparable [xxi]. A more recent study suggests that melting of the Antarctic ice sheet alone could lead to sea level rise of more than 15m by 2500 under a high emissions scenario [xxii]. On a multi-millennial time scale, projections based on process-based models suggest a quasi-linear GMSL rise of 13m per degree of global warming for sustained warming over a period of 2000 years. Significantly higher estimates for GMSL rise on multi-millennial time scales, of up to 50m over 10000 years for a high emissions scenario, have been derived from the geological record [xxiii]. Projections: mean sea level along the European coastline Regional and local sea levels differ from the global mean owing to large-scale factors such as non-uniform changes in ocean density and changes in ocean circulation. Furthermore, disintegrating land-ice affects sea level differentially because of gravitational effects and the viscoelastic response of the lithosphere [xxiv]. Sea level is also affected by changes in atmospheric loading (the inverse barometer effect) and vertical land movement. While there remains considerable uncertainty in the spatial patterns of future sea level rise, around 70% of the worlds coastlines are expected to experience a local mean sea level change within 20% of the projected GMSL change [xxv]. Relative sea level change along most of the European coastline is projected to be reasonably similar to the global average. The main exceptions are the northern Baltic Sea and the northern Atlantic coast, which are experiencing considerable land rise as a consequence of post-glacial rebound. As a result, sea level relative to land in these regions is rising slower than elsewhere or may even decrease (Figure5) [xxvi]. A probabilistic assessment of regional sea-level rise in northern Europe reported central estimates of relative sea level change during the 21st century for the RCP8.5 emissions scenario from 14cm (in Lule, northern Sweden) to 84 cm in Den Helders (Netherlands); high estimates (with a 5% probability to be exceeded) range from 52cm to 181cm, respectively [xxvii]. A recent review study estimated that 21st century sea level rise along the Dutch coast would be in the range of 25 to 75cm for a low warming scenario and 50 to 100cm for a high warming scenario (year 2100, compared with the 19862005 baseline period) [xxviii]. Making regional projections for relatively small isolated and semi-closed ocean basins, such as the Mediterranean or the Baltic, is even more difficult than for the open ocean. Sea level rise substantially increases the risk of coastal flooding, which affects people, communities and infrastructure. For example, the ClimateCost and PESETAII projects have estimated that a 30cm sea level rise by the end of the 21st century, in the absence of public adaptation, would more than triple annual damages from coastal floods in the EU from EUR5 to 17billion [xxix]. These potential impacts can be substantially reduced by timely adaptation measures, but they are associated with significant costs [xxx].   [i] J. A.

"assessment  Heating and cooling degree days     The number of population-weighted heating degree days (HDD) decreased by 8.2 % between the 19511980 and 19812014 periods; the decrease during the 19812014 period was on average 9.9 HDDs per year (0.45 % per year). The largest absolute decrease occurred in northern and north-western Europe.   The number of population-weighted cooling degree days (CDD) increased by 49.1 % between the 19511980 and 19812014 periods; the increase during the period 19812014 was on average 1.2 HDDs per year (1.9 % per year). The largest absolute increase occurred in southern Europe.   The projected decrease in HDDs as a result of future climate change during the 21st century is somewhat larger than the projected increase in CDDs in absolute terms. However, in economic terms, these two effects are almost equal in Europe, because cooling is generally more expensive than heating.   The projected increases in the cooling demand in southern and central Europe may further exacerbate peaks in electricity demand in the summer unless appropriate adaptation measures are taken.     heating degree days cooling degree days hdd trend cdd trend    CLIM CLIM047 047,Past trends The number of population-weighted heating degree days (HDDs) decreased by 8.2% between the periods 19511980 and 19812014. The decrease during the period 19812014 was on average 9.9HDDs per year, although with substantial interannual variation (Figure 1, left); this linear trend corresponds to an annual decrease of 0.45% (relative to the 19511980 average). The largest absolute decrease occurred in northern and north-western Europe, where the heating demand is highest (Figure 2, left). The number of population-weighted cooling degree days (CDDs) increased by 49.1% between the periods 19511980 and 19812014. The increase during the period 19812014 was on average 1.2CDDs per year, although with substantial interannual variation (Figure 1, right); this linear trend corresponds to an annual increase of 1.9% (relative to the 19511980 average). The largest absolute increase occurred in southern Europe (latitudes below 45N), where the energy demand for cooling in summer is highest (Figure 2, right). The relative increase in CDDs is much higher than the relative decrease in HDDs, because of lower absolute values. In principle, HDD and CDD values can be added together to give a new indicator, energy degree days, which has shown a decrease since the 1950s. However, one must consider that HDDs and CDDs are climatological parameters and that the energy demand linked to their values is not the same, as heating and cooling systems are often based on different technologies. Figure 1 highlights some important features of the evolution of the pattern of HDDs and CDDs in Europe since the 1950s. In the first three decades, HDDs were roughly constant and CDDs declined slightly. Since the beginning of the 1980s, Europe has started experiencing a markedly declining overall trend in HDDs, and a markedly increasing trend in CDDs, pointing to a general increase in cooling needs and a general decrease in heating needs. Figure 2 shows that the decrease in HDDs has been particularly strong in the Alpine areas and the Baltic and Scandinavian countries, whereas the increase in CDDs is particularly strong in southern Europe, around the Mediterranean and in the Balkan countries. Some overlapping of medium to strong HDD and CDD effects is noticeable in Bulgaria, southern France, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Spain. Projections Temperatures in Europe are projected to continue to increase. Hence, the trend of a decreasing number of HDDs and an increasing number of CDDs is very likely to continue, and most likely to accelerate [i]. Model simulations performed in the ClimateCost project (based on HDD and CDD data) have estimated the decrease in residential heating energy demand in the EU as a result of climate change alone (above the SRES A1B baseline without climate change) to be 28 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe)/year by 2050 and 65Mtoe/year by 2100; the corresponding projected increase in cooling energy demand is 16Mtoe/year by 2050 and 53Mtoe/year by 2100. While the projected physical energy reductions for heating are higher than the increase in cooling demand, in economic terms the projected reduction in total heating demand is about the same as the increase in cooling demand, as cooling is more expensive than heating. In cold countries, such as Norway, the net effect of projected temperature increases reduces total energy demand, whereas in warm countries, such as Spain, it increases energy demand. All projected changes are considerably lower under a mitigation scenario with lower emissions [ii].   [i] Rasmus E.

"assessment  Meteorological and hydrological droughts     Drought has been a recurrent feature of the European climate. From 20062010, on average 15 % of the EU territory and 17 % of the EU population have been affected by meteorological droughts each year.   The severity and frequency of meteorological and hydrological droughts have increased in parts of Europe, in particular in south-western and central Europe.   Available studies project large increases in the frequency, duration and severity of meteorological and hydrological droughts in most of Europe over the 21st century, except for northern European regions. The greatest increase in drought conditions is projected for southern Europe, where it would increase competition between different water users, such as agriculture, industry, tourism and households.     river discharges river flow climate change water balances changes floods key climate variables precipitation drought         CLIM CLIM018 018,Past trends Drought has been a recurrent feature of the European climate. From 20062010, on average 15 % of the EU territory and 17 % of the EU population have been affected by meteorological droughts each year. In the 1990s and 2000s the drought hotspots were the Mediterranean area and the Carpathian Region [i]. The frequency of meteorological droughts in Europe has increased since 1950 in parts of southern Europe and central Europe (Austria and Hungary), but droughts have become less frequent in northern Europe and parts of eastern Europe (Figure 1, left). Trends in drought severity (based on a combination of Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI)) also show significant increases in the Mediterranean region (in particular the Iberian Peninsula, France, Italy and Albania) and parts of central and south-eastern Europe, and decreases in northern and parts of eastern Europe (Figure 1, right) [ii]. Most stream gauges in Europe show a decrease in summer low flows over the second half of the 20th century (Figure 2). However, current data availability is insufficient for attributing this trend to global climate change [iii]. Projections An assessment of European meteorological droughts based on different drought indices and an ensemble of RCMs has projected drier conditions for southern Europe for the mid-21st century, with increases in the length, magnitude and area of drought events [iv]. In contrast, drought occurrence was projected to decrease in northern Europe [v]. Similar results were obtained in later studies based on different indices and climate projections [vi]. A model ensemble from the EURO-CORDEX community projects that the frequency and duration of extreme meteorological droughts (defined as having a value below 2 of the SPI-6) will significantly increase in the future [vii]. These projections showed the largest increases in frequency for extreme droughts in parts of the Iberian Peninsula, southern Italy and the eastern Mediterranean, especially at the end of the century with respect to the baseline period 19712000 (Figure 3). The changes are most pronounced for the RCP8.5 high emissions scenario and slightly less extreme for the moderate (RCP4.5) scenario. Drought projections that also consider potential evapotranspiration (e.g. based on the SPEI, the Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) or the SupplyDemand Drought Index (SDDI)) showed substantially greater increases in the areas affected by drought than those based on the precipitation-based SPI alone. For example, the fraction of the Mediterranean region under drought was projected to increase by 10% by the end of the 21st century based on RCP8.5 using the SPI, whereas an increase of 60% was projected using the SPEI [viii]. The projected increases in droughts in large parts of southern Europe would increase competition between different water users, such as agriculture, industry, tourism and households. The top row of Figure 4 depicts the projected impact of climate change on the 20-year return level minimum river flow (also known as minimum discharge; left) and deficit volumes (right), which are two measures for water availability and drought intensity. An increasing severity of river flow droughts is projected for most European regions, except for northern and north-eastern Europe. The greatest increase in drought risk is projected for southern Europe, but mean increases are also projected for large parts of central and north-western Europe. However, these increases show large seasonal variations and also depend on how the models represent evapotranspiration and soil moisture [ix]. The bottom row of Figure 4 shows the combined impact of climate change and changes in water consumption (based on the Economy First water use scenario) on the same drought indices. In most regions, projected increases in water consumption further aggravate river flow droughts [x]. Water use and abstraction will exacerbate minimum low-flows in many parts of the Mediterranean region, leading to increased probabilities of water deficits when maximum water demand overlaps with minimum or low availability [xi].

"assessment  Crop water demand     Climate change led to an increase in the crop water demand and thus the crop water deficit from 1995 to 2015 in large parts of southern and eastern Europe; a decrease has been estimated for parts of north-western Europe.   The projected increases in temperature will lead to increased evapotranspiration rates, thereby increasing crop water demand across Europe. This increase may partly be alleviated through reduced transpiration at higher atmospheric CO 2  levels.   The impact of increasing water requirements is expected to be most acute in southern and central Europe, where the crop water deficit and irrigation requirements are projected to increase. This may lead to an expansion of irrigation systems, even in regions currently without irrigation systems. However, this expansion may be constrained by projected reductions in water availability and increased demand from other sectors and for other uses.     crops climate change crop water requirement grain maize crop water deficit     CLIM CLIM033 033,Past trends Irrigation in Europe is currently concentrated along the Mediterranean, where in some countries more than 80% of the total freshwater abstraction is used for agricultural purposes [i]. However, consistent observations of water demand and consumption for agriculture do not currently exist for Europe, partly because of unrecorded water abstractions and national differences in accounting and reporting. Modelling approaches can be used to compute net irrigation requirements. Two studies estimated the net irrigation requirements in Europe for 19952002 and for the year 2000 with a total of three different model systems [ii]. The results show an irrigation requirement of up to 2140km3 for Spain, which had the highest net irrigation requirement in the EU-27. Crop water demand, defined as the water consumed during the growing season, depends on the crop type and the timing of the growing season. Water demand can be modelled using meteorological data and information on crop management, and the difference between crop water demand and rainfall constitutes the crop water deficit. Figure 1 shows the change in the crop water deficit for grain maize, which is a crop that is often grown under irrigated conditions because it is mostly grown during the summer season. The hatched areas in Figure 1 show the areas where crop water demand exceeds average rainfall and thus may have an irrigation demand. The trends for 19952015 show an increase in the crop water deficit for maize in large parts of southern and eastern Europe; a decrease has been estimated for parts of north-western Europe. Some of the effects of estimated changes in the crop water deficit may also be related to the duration of the crop growing period, which is shortened under higher temperatures, thus leading to less water being consumed. Projections A multi-model study using seven global hydrological models driven by five global climate models under four RCP scenarios estimated changes in irrigation water demand (IWD) across regions during the 21st century. Under the low and low-to-medium emissions scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, respectively), the simulated changes in IWD across Europe were small. For RCP6.0, the multi-model average suggests a substantial increase in IWD in most of Europe. For RCP8.5, the projected increase in IWD exceeds 25% in most of the irrigated regions in Europe [iii]. Most hydrological models in this multi-model study did not consider the physiological effect of increased CO2, which can increase the water-use efficiency of crop plants. The only available study using a hydrological and a crop model that considers the physiological effect of increased CO2 still estimates that there is a high likelihood that IWD in southern Europe will increase by more than 20% until 2080 [iv]. Regional case studies suggest much higher increases in IWD in some regions [v]. Climate change will also affect water availability. The Mediterranean area is projected to experience a decline in water availability, and future irrigation will be constrained by reduced run-off and groundwater resources, by demand from other sectors and by economic costs [vi]. Assuming that urban water demands would be prioritised over agricultural purposes, the proportional reduction of water availability for irrigation in many European basins is larger than the reduction in annual run-off [vii]. The projected changes in the crop water deficit for grain maize are shown in Figure 2 for two different climate models. The simulations are based on the WOFOST crop model, which considers the effect of increases in the CO2 concentrations on the water use efficiency of maize. The simulations for both climate model projections for the 2030s show an increasing crop water deficit for large areas of Europe, in particular over central Europe. This will increase the water requirement for irrigation, including in areas not currently applying irrigation. Adaptation measures and the integrated management of water, often at catchment scale, are needed to address future competing demands for water between agriculture, energy, conservation and human settlements. New irrigation infrastructure will be required in some regions [viii].

"assessment  Water-limited crop yield     Yields of several rainfed crops are levelling off (e.g. wheat in some European countries) or decreasing (e.g. grapes in Spain), whereas yields of other crops (e.g. maize in northern Europe) are increasing. These changes are attributed partly to observed climate change, in particular warming.   Extreme climatic events, including droughts and heat waves, have negatively affected crop productivity in Europe during the first decade of the 21st century.   Future climate change could lead to both decreases and increases in average yield, depending on the crop type and the climatic and management conditions in the region. There is a general pattern of projected increases in productivity in northern Europe and reductions in southern Europe, but with differences between crop types.   Projected increases in extreme climatic events are expected to increase crop yield variability and to lead to yield reductions in the future throughout Europe.     wheat climate change agriculture crop yield    CLIM CLIM032 032,Past trends A global analysis of yields of cereal crops (wheat, maize and barley) has shown that increasing mean temperatures in recent decades have had a negative effect on yield [i]. Similar effects have been observed for various countries in Europe [ii]. Increasing temperatures have been identified as one of the main causes of the lack of yield increase in winter wheat in France, despite improvements in crop breeding [iii]. Grain yields in southern Europe seem to have been levelling off. There is also a tendency for an increasing variability of grain yields in France and Italy, linked to the occurrence of heat waves and droughts [iv]. Similar effects of heat haves and droughts have been observed globally, whereas floods and intense rainfall have not been seen to affect overall crop production [v]. In Italy and southern-central Europe, the potential crop yields of potato, wheat, maize and barley significantly decreased over the time period 19762005 owing to temperature and radiation change effects [vi]. In north-east Spain, grape yield has been declining because of increasing water deficits since the 1960s [vii]. Droughts and heat waves affected the crop production in large areas of southern and central Europe in 2003 and 2007 [viii]. An increase in climate-induced variability in maize yield has been observed over recent decades in France [ix]. Climate change has also shown positive effects on yields. Potato and sugar beet have responded positively to increasing temperatures through an increase in yields, most likely due to the longer growing seasons [x]. In Scotland, increasing temperatures are estimated to have increased the potential potato yield by up to 39% over the period 19602006 [xi]. In parts of the UK and parts of northern-central Europe, the yield potential of wheat, sugar beet and maize has increased since 1976 [xii]. Grain yields in maize have been steadily increasing in northern Europe, most likely linked to the warmer climate [xiii]. Projections The impact of future changes in climate on crop yield depends on the characteristics of the climatic change within a region, as well as on a combination of other environmental, economic, technological and management factors [xiv]. A broad analysis of climate change scenarios for agricultural productivity in Europe has provided a clear picture of deterioration of agroclimatic conditions through increased drought stress and a shortening of the active growing season across large parts of southern and central Europe [xv]. Other studies suggest an increasing number of unfavourable years for agricultural production in many European climatic zones, limiting winter crop expansion and increasing the risk of cereal yield loss [xvi]. Dynamic crop models may be used to evaluate the effect of climate change on crop production, provided that the model is tested for the accuracy of its response to various climate change factors [xvii]. Figure 1 shows projected changes in water-limited winter wheat yields in Europe for the 2030s (compared with the 2000s) for climate projections from two different climate models (HadGEM2-ES) and MIROC-ESM-CHEM) using the WOFOSTcrop model. The top row of the map shows the results when the CO2 concentration is assumed to be that of the 2000s, whereas the bottom row shows the results when the effect of CO2 fertilisation on crop growth was simulated. When no CO2 fertilisation effect is taken into account, simulations using both climate models show a decrease in wheat yields over most of Europe, with the exception of some northern areas. When the CO2 fertilisation effect is taken into account, model simulations generally show a yield increase in most areas, with the notable exception of central Europe for one climate model (HadGEM2). The simulated moderate yield reduction over central Europe for this model indicates that increased CO2 does not compensate for unfavourable climatic conditions, such as prolonged and more intense droughts. These simulations did not include adaptations to climate change, such as changes in crop species and crop management, owing to the inherent complexity of agricultural systems. Therefore, the projected yields in 2030 may be slightly underestimated. A study on the potential effectiveness by 2040 of adaptation by farmers in southern and central Europe suggests that the adaptation potential to future warming is large for maize but limited for wheat and barley [xviii]. Future crop yield developments are subject to considerable uncertainty, in particular with regard to climate projections and the magnitude of CO2 fertilisation effects in practice. For example, Figure 1 does not consider all of the main sources of uncertainty, as only two climate models and one crop model have been used to produce the simulations. A wider variation would have been found if more climate model projections and more crop models had been used. A large proportion of the uncertainty in climate change impact projections for crop yields are the result of variations among different crop models rather than the variations among the downscaled climate projections [xix]. Uncertainties in simulated impacts increase with higher CO2 concentrations and associated warming. Figure 2 provides an aggregated picture of the expected changes in crop yields across Europe by considering three crops, an ensemble of 12 GCMs and the current irrigated area. These estimates include the effects of changes in temperature, precipitation and CO2 concentration on crop yield. The regional pattern of projected impacts is clear, generally showing improved conditions in northern Europe and worse conditions in southern Europe. Despite the above-mentioned uncertainties, there is a clear indication of deteriorating agroclimatic conditions in terms of increased drought stress and a shortening of the active growing season in central and southern Europe [xx]. There is a risk of an increasing number of extremely unfavourable years, which might lead to higher interannual variability in crop yield and constitute a challenge for proper crop management. Some of the climate-related risk factors, such as high temperature stress, flooding and adverse sowing and harvesting conditions, are included only to a limited extent in current crop models, such as those used for the projections in Figure 1. Figure 3 shows that the frequency of adverse agroclimatic conditions for wheat is projected to increase substantially across Europe under climate change, with the largest risks generally experienced in southern parts of Europe. These increases in extreme events may severely restrict the efficiency of adaptations to climate change, including the shifting of wheat production to other regions as the risk of adverse events beyond the key wheat-growing areas increases even more [xxi].

"assessment  Agrophenology     The flowering of several perennial and annual crops has advanced by about two days per decade during the last 50 years.   Changes in crop phenology are affecting crop production and the relative performance of different crop species and varieties. The shortening of the grain-filling phase of cereals and oilseed crops can be particularly detrimental to yield.   Shortening of the growth phases of many crops is expected to continue, but this may be altered by selecting other crop cultivars and changing planting dates, which in some cases can lead to longer growth periods.     climate agriculture atmosphere   CLIM CLIM031 031,Past trends Changes in the phenological phases of several perennial crops in Europe, such as advances in the start of the growing season of fruit trees (2.3 days/decade), cherry tree blossom (2.0 days/decade) and apple tree blossom (2.2 days/decade), in line with increases of up to 1.4C in mean annual air temperature, were observed in Germany during 19612000 [i]. Sowing or planting dates of several agricultural crops have advanced; for example, for oats in Germany (19592009), sowing has advanced by 0.2 days/decade, flowering by 1.9 days/decade, maturity by 3.3 days/decade and harvest by 2.1 days/decade [ii]. This indicates that factors other than temperature may be affecting sowing and harvesting dates, e.g. soil workability and grain moisture for harvesting. An analysis of the modelled flowering date for winter wheat in Europe between 1985 and 2014 shows a general and clear increasing trend, which is most pronounced in north-western Europe (Figure 1). In large parts of Europe, the modelled flowering date has advanced by two to four days/decade. This modelled advance in flowering date probably exceeds what is observed in reality, as a longer growth duration will alter plants responses to day length and farmers choices of cultivars, reducing the overall response. Projections With the projected warming of the climate in Europe, further reductions in the number of days required for flowering and to reach maturity in cereals may be expected throughout Europe [iii]. Since many plants (including cereals) in Europe require long days to flower, the effect of warming on the date of flowering is smaller than would otherwise be expected. The flowering date for winter wheat was projected to show the greatest advance in western parts of Europe, with an advance of up to two weeks by 2050. The projected advance in the date of reaching maturity is greater than the advance in flowering date, leading to a shortening of the grain-filling period, which will negatively affect yields. One of the main adaptation options to cope with the shortening of crop growth phases is choosing crop cultivars that have higher thermal requirements, as this will reduce the negative yield effects of a shorter growth duration. In practice, this needs to be balanced against the need to avoid periods of high temperature stresses and drought. Breeding for crop cultivars with optimal timing of crop phenological phases is therefore a critical adaptation option [iv].

"assessment  Growing season for agricultural crops     The thermal growing season for agricultural crops in Europe has lengthened by more than 10 days since 1992. The delay in the end of the growing season has been more pronounced than the advance of the start of the season. The length of the growing season has increased more in northern and eastern Europe than in western and southern Europe.   The growing season is projected to increase further throughout most of Europe owing to the earlier onset of growth in spring and later senescence in autumn.   The projected lengthening of the thermal growing season would allow a northwards expansion of warm-season crops to areas that were not previously suitable. In parts of southern Europe (e.g. Spain), warmer conditions will allow crop cultivation to be shifted to the winter.     climate agriculture atmosphere   CLIM CLIM030 030,Past trends Increasing air temperatures are significantly affecting the duration of the growing season over large areas of Europe. Many studies report a lengthening of the period between the occurrence of the last spring frost and the first autumn frost. This has occurred in recent decades in several areas in Europe and more generally in the Northern Hemisphere [i]. Studies of changes in the growing season based on remote sensing show a diverse spatial pattern in Europe [ii]. Across all of Europe, the delay in the end of the season of 8.2 days in the period 19922008 was more significant than the advanced start of the season by 3.2 days [iii]. An analysis of the frost-free period in Europe between 1985 and 2014 shows a general and clear increasing trend (Figure 1). The trend is not uniformly spread over Europe. The highest rates of change (an extension of the frost-free period by more than 0.8 days per year) were recorded in eastern and northern Europe; little or no change was observed along the Mediterranean coast, where frost is a rare phenomenon. Projections A warming of the climate is expected to result in an earlier start of the growing season in spring and a longer duration in autumn. The date of the last frost in spring is projected to advance by about 510 days by 2030 and by 1015 days by 2050 throughout most of Europe [iv]. A longer growing season will, in many cases, allow for the introduction of new crop species that were previously unfavourable owing to low temperatures or short growing seasons, but it may also increase the spread of weeds, insect pests and diseases [v]. The suitability for growing certain crops will also depend on the total amount of heat received during the growing season, expressed as a temperature sum. Projections show that the greatest absolute increases in temperature sum will be in southern Europe, whereas relative changes are much larger in northern than in southern Europe [vi]. The extension of the growing season is expected to be particularly beneficial in northern Europe, where new crops could be cultivated and where water availability generally does not restrict growth [vii]. In parts of the Mediterranean area, the cultivation of some crops may shift from the summer season to the winter season, which could offset some of the negative impacts of heat waves and droughts during summer. Other areas of Europe, such as western France and parts of south-eastern Europe, will experience yield reductions from hot, dry summers without the possibility of shifting the crop production into the winter seasons [viii].

"assessment  Vector-borne diseases     The transmission cycles of vector-borne diseases are sensitive to climatic factors, but disease risks are also affected by factors such as land use, vector control, human behaviour, population movements and public health capacities.   Climate change is regarded as the principal factor behind the observed move of the tick species Ixodes ricinus  the vector of Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis in Europe  to higher latitudes and altitudes. Climate change is projected to lead to further northwards and upwards shifts in the distribution of Ixodes ricinus.   It is generally suspected that climate change has played (and will continue to play) a role in the expansion of other disease vectors, notably the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), which can disseminate several diseases including dengue, chikungunya and Zika, and Phlebotomus species of sandflies, which transmit leishmaniasis.   The unprecedented upsurge in the number of human West Nile fever infections in the summer of 2010 in south-eastern Europe was preceded by extreme hot spells in this region. High temperature anomalies in July were identified as contributing factors to the recurrent outbreaks in the subsequent years.     climate chikungunya transmission diseases west nile fever climate change human health climate suitability       CLIM CLIM037 037,Past trends: tick-borne diseases Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) are the two most important tick-borne diseases in Europe, both of which are transmitted primarily by Ixodes ricinus. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the EU, with a reported incidence of approximately 65000 cases per year. However, there is no standardised case definition or diagnosis for Lyme disease in Europe, so this number represents only a best estimate. The number of reported cases of TBE in the EU was 2560 during 2012. The mean annual reporting of TBE cases has increased by approximately 400% in European endemic areas over the past 30 years, although this is almost certainly the result of more robust detection methods and diagnosis [i]. A key determinant of the number of reported cases is the abundance of ticks, a factor which is sensitive to climatic variables, notably temperature and humidity. Currently,Ixodes ricinusis present across much of continental Europe (Figure 1). There have already been reports on the northerly migration of the tick species in Sweden [ii], and to higher altitudes in the Czech Republic and Austria [iii]. Range shifts have also been observed in Germany and Norway [iv]. A high incidence of tick-borne disease is correlated with mild winters and warm, humid summers in Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden, although this could be the result of climate effects on human behaviour [v]. A high risk of Lyme disease has been associated with mild winters, high summer temperatures, low seasonal variation of temperatures and high scores on vegetation indices [vi]. There are considerable differences between the distribution of ticks and the observed incidence of TBE [vii]. It is not currently possible to assess the relative importance of climatic changes and of other factors influencing disease incidence, including vaccination coverage, tourism patterns, public awareness, distribution of rodent host populations and socio-economic conditions [viii]. There is limited evidence that other tick-borne diseases may be sensitive to climate change. Some models have suggested that the Mediterranean basin has become suitable for an expansion of CrimeanCongo haemorrhagic fever [ix], but demographic factors, farming practices and land-use change may be more important drivers [x]. The distribution of Rickettsia has also expanded in recent years, but the reasons for this are not yet well understood [xi], and few if any recent studies have interrogated the links between rickettsia diseases and climate change. Past trends: mosquito-borne diseases Mosquito habitats are influenced by temperature, humidity and precipitation levels. The Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) is an important vector in Europe for transmitting viral diseases, including Zika, chikungunya and dengue. The first record of its establishment was in Italy in 1990, and Aedes albopictusis now present in several EU countries and in some countries neighbouring the EU (Figure 2). It has substantially extended its range in recent years, aided by trade and travel. It is generally suspected that climate change has also played a role in this expansion, but the extent to which this is the case is unclear [xii]. The introduction and geographical expansion of the distribution of Aedes albopictus within Europe has coincided with favourable climatic suitability for the mosquito in the Balkans, Italy, France and Benelux and in western Germany, on the eastern coast of Spain and on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea [xiii]. Other parts of Europe are also climatically suitable for Aedes albopictus, even if they have not recorded the presence of the vector (Figure 3) [xiv]. Mosquito-borne diseases have not been a substantial concern within Europe until recently. However, locally transmitted (i.e. autochthonous) outbreaks of chikungunya, dengue and even malaria have occurred in recent years [xv]. Several disease outbreaks transmitted by Aedes. albopictus have been reported in Europe: chikungunya in Italy and in France in 2010, 2014 and 2015, as well as local transmissions of dengue in France and Croatia in 2010 [xvi]. Heavy rainfall events may have increased the risk of the autochthonous transmission of chikungunya in France in 2014 by leading to a rapid rise in vector abundance [xvii]. No autochthonous transmission of dengue has been reported in Europe since 2010. The risk of travellers importing Zika, dengue or chikungunya coincides with the seasons and locations of active Aedes albopictusin Europe [xviii]. With continued expansion of Aedes albopictus in continental Europe, the risk of further introduction and transmission of Zika, chikungunya and dengue will continue to exist. The risk of chikungunya introductions into Europe via returning travellers has probably increased following the large-scale outbreak of chikungunya that began in the Caribbean in late 2013 and has subsequently continued in many American countries [xix]. Aedes albopictusis not the primary vector for dengue and, although some parts of Europe are currently climatically suitable to its primary vector (Aedesaegypti), the risk of significant dengue transmission in continental Europe is currently very low, providing that the vector remains unestablished and control measures are in place [xx]. Aedes aegypti has, however, been responsible for dengue outbreaks in European territories, such as the 2013 outbreak in Madeira, Portugal [xxi]. Malaria was largely eradicated in Europe in the second half of the 20th century. However, the malaria vectors (Anopheles mosquitos) are still present in much of the European Union, and a few sporadic cases of local transmission occur each year [xxii]. The risk of malaria re-establishment in a particular region depends on climatic and ecological factors, as well as human vulnerabilities to infection. During 20092012, Greece experienced autochthonous malaria transmission; temperature and other environmental variables were identified as determinants of environmental suitability [xxiii]. However, socio-economic development is a key mitigating factor of malaria risk [xxiv], which therefore remains very low throughout Europe. West Nile virus (WNV) infections in humans can be quite severe, particularly among the elderly, but many other cases can go unnoticed (more than 60% are asymptomatic) and occur through mosquito (Culexspecies) bites. Cases can also be acquired through blood transfusion or organ, tissue and cell transplantations and, although rare, such cases have been reported [xxv]. Since 2010, there have been annual outbreaks in south-eastern and eastern Europe, suggesting an endemic transmission cycle and thus a resurgent public health problem (Figure 4) [xxvi]. Positive temperature anomalies from the monthly averages were the most important determinants of the 2010 WNV outbreak [xxvii]. Over the subsequent years, other environmental drivers (besides temperature) were also identified as important, such as the state of vegetation, water bodies (modified normalised difference water index) and bird migratory routes [xxviii]. Past trends: sandfly-borne diseases Leishmaniasis is the most common disease transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies in Europe. The transmission of the two parasites responsible for this disease that are endemic in the EU (Leishmania infantum, causing visceral leishmaniasis, and Leishmania tropica, causing cutaneous leishmaniasis) is heavily influenced by temperature. Leishmania tropica occurs sporadically in Greece and neighbouring countries, while Leishmania infantum is endemic in the Mediterranean region of the EU. Sandfly vectors currently have wider distribution ranges than the parasites. The evidence for an impact of climate change on the distribution of the sandfly in Europe is scarce [xxix]. Climate change was suggested as one possible reason for the observed northwards expansion of sandfly vectors in Italy [xxx]. The contemporary risk for central Europe has been estimated to be low owing to temperature constraints on pathogen growth [xxxi]. Projections: tick-borne diseases Cold temperatures appear to determine the altitudinal and latitudinal limits of Ixodes ricinus[xxxii]. Thus, an expansion of the distribution range of ticks to higher altitudes and latitudes is projected, as milder winter temperatures, longer vegetation seasons and earlier onsets of summer appear and warmer temperatures occur, under the condition that their natural hosts (deer) would also shift their distribution [xxxiii]. One climate projection model anticipates a 3.8% overall habitat expansion for Ixodes ricinus in Europe by 20402060, with expansion into higher altitudes and latitudes (notably Scandinavia and the Baltic countries) and a contraction in some areas including the Alps, the Pyrenees, the interior of Italy and north-western Poland [xxxiv]. This aligns with other models of climate change that anticipate Ixodes ricinus range expansions under climate change scenarios [xxxv], but it has been acknowledged that many uncertainties exist in these models and that extrapolating the projected habitat range of ticks to generate projections of the incidence of tick-borne disease leads to additional uncertainties. Nonetheless, the incidence of TBE may shift to higher altitudes and latitudes along with the distribution of Ixodes ricinus, potentially increasing the risk in some parts of northern and central Europe, unless targeted vaccination programmes and TBE surveillance are introduced. Similarly, TBE risk is generally expected to decrease in southern Europe. Warmer winters may facilitate the expansion of Lyme disease to higher latitudes and altitudes, particularly in northern Europe, but it would decrease in the parts of Europe that are projected to experience increased droughts [xxxvi]. Projections: mosquito-borne diseases Various studies have found that warm seasonal and annual temperature and sufficient rainfall provide favourable climatic conditions for Aedes albopictusin Europe [xxxvii]. The climatic suitability for Aedes albopictus is projected to increase where climate models project warmer and wetter climates, such as south-eastern United Kingdom [xxxviii], the Balkans and central Europe, while suitability generally decreases where climate becomes drier, such as in some regions of Spain and Portugal [xxxix]. This corresponds with a modelling study that demonstrated a general decline in habitat suitability in southern Europe and the Mediterranean area, and an increase in habitat suitability in northern and eastern European countries [xl]. The risk of chikungunya may increase in Europe, particularly in those regions where the seasonal activity of Aedes albopictusaligns with the seasonality of endemic chikungunya infections abroad, thereby potentially increasing the risk of importation via travellers [xli]. Models of chikungunya transmission in Europe under climate change scenarios have identified France, northern Italy and the Pannonian Basin (east-central Europe) as the areas at highest risk, with increases in the level of risk in much of western Europe, including the Benelux countries and Germany. In contrast, Mediterranean regions demonstrated a decreased risk, although the models suggested that they will mostly remain climatically suitable for chikungunya transmission (Figure 5) [xlii]. A climate-related increase in the density or active season ofAedes albopictuscould lead to a small increase in the risk of dengue in Europe. The risk could also increase if the temperature increase facilitated the re-establishment ofAedes aegypti, the primary dengue vector. Further modelling studies are required to assess whether climate change would increase or decrease the climatic suitability forAedes aegyptiin continental Europe. Some malaria models suggest that there will be increased suitability for malaria transmission in continental Europe under future climate change, but projected malaria impacts are highly sensitive to model design [xliii]. Nevertheless, socio-economic development, land-use and public health control measures would most likely be sufficient to mitigate the risk of malaria at the fringes of its distribution, despite the likelihood of sporadic introductions of the parasite through global travel [xliv]. Climate change has previously not been expected to have a significant impact on WNV transmission in Europe [xlv]. However, climate change could influence the transmission of the virus by affecting the geographical distribution of vectors and pathogens, by changing the migratory patterns of bird populations and through changes in the life cycle of bird-associated pathogens. Temperature increases could also play a role. The WNV risk in Europe has been projected into 2025 and 2050, with July temperature projections under a medium emissions scenario (IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B), keeping other variables constant (e.g. state of vegetation, water bodies and bird migratory routes) [xlvi]. The results reveal a progressive expansion of areas with an elevated probability for WNV infections, particularly at the edges of the transmission areas (Figure 6). Projections for 2025 show an increased probability of WNV infection in eastern Croatia, north-eastern Greece and north-western Turkey; high-risk areas will have expanded even more by 2050. Projections: sandfly-borne diseases Future climate change could have an impact on the distribution of leishmaniasis by affecting the abundance of vector species and parasite development. Recent modelling indicates that the central European climate will become increasingly suitable for Phlebotomus species of sandflies [xlvii]. One modelling study concluded that, by the end of the 2060s, France, Germany, western Poland and southern United Kingdom could be colonised by sandfly species, principally Phlebotomus ariasi and Phlebotomus pernicious, while the entire Mediterranean Basin, Balkan Peninsula and Pannonian Basin would all be potentially climatically suitable habitats for many Phlebotomus species [xlviii]. Such expansions of sandfly species would increase the risk of leishmaniasis, but may be somewhat constrained by the limited migration ability of sandflies. The risk of disease transmission may also decrease in some areas in southern Europe where climate conditions become too hot and dry for vector survival.   [i] J. M.

"assessment  Extreme temperatures and health     Heat waves and extreme cold spells are associated with decreases in general population well-being and with increases in mortality and morbidity, especially in vulnerable population groups. Temperature thresholds for health impacts differ according to the region and season.   The number of heat extremes has substantially increased across Europe in recent decades. Heat waves have caused tens of thousands of premature deaths in Europe since 2000.   It is virtually certain that the length, frequency and intensity of heat waves will increase in the future. This increase will lead to a substantial increase in mortality over the next decades, especially in vulnerable population groups, unless adaptation measures are taken.   Cold-related mortality is projected to decrease owing to better social, economic and housing conditions in many countries in Europe. There is inconclusive evidence about whether or not the projected warming will lead to a further substantial decrease in cold-related mortality.     mortality temperatures temperature mortality   CLIM CLIM036 036,Past trends In large parts of Europe, summertime temperature records, which are associated with prolonged heat waves, have increased substantially in recent decades. The summer of 2003 broke temperature records in large parts of western Europe; temperature records were again broken in different parts of Europe during the summers of 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2015 [i]. The record warm summer of 2003 was an outstanding example of increased mortality during periods of extreme temperatures, with an estimated premature mortality of 70000 people in Europe [ii]. The heat waves of the summer of 2015 caused more than 3000 deaths in France alone [iii]. The largest effect of heat has been observed among the elderly, but in some cities younger adults have also been affected [iv]. Elderly people are more vulnerable to the effects of heat waves, owing, in part, to poorer physical health and the effects of cognitive impairment on the perception of heat-related health risk; this is the population considered most at risk of heat-related mortality [v]. In addition to the elderly, those with chronic diseases and persons of lower socio-economic status also have a heightened risk of heat-related mortality [vi]. Furthermore, health risks during heat extremes are greater in people who are physically very active. This has importance for outdoor recreational activities, and it is especially relevant for the impacts of climate change on occupational health (e.g. for manual labourers) [vii]. The above-mentioned multi-country global observational study found that (moderate) cold was responsible for a higher proportion of deaths than (moderate) heat. The study collected data for daily mortality, temperature and other confounding variables from Italy (11 cities, 19872010), Spain (51 cities, 19902010), Sweden (one county, 19902002), the United Kingdom (10 regions, 19932006) and other areas outside Europe [viii]. The results should be interpreted with caution when applied to other regions that were not included in the database. Figure 1 shows the overall cumulative exposureresponse curves for four European cities with the corresponding minimum mortality temperature and the cut-os used to define extreme temperatures. Risk increases slowly and linearly for cold temperatures below the minimum mortality temperature, although some locations (e.g. London and Madrid) showed a higher increase for extreme cold than others. Risk generally escalated quickly and non-linearly at high temperatures. Deaths attributable to extreme heat are roughly as frequent as those attributable to moderate heat, while those attributable to extreme cold are negligible compared with those caused by moderate cold [ix]. Other studies have estimated that 1.62.0% of total mortality in the warm season is attributable to heat; about 40% of these deaths occur on isolated hot days in periods that would not be classified as heat waves [x]. Comparison of these estimates should be made with caution, as not only the methods used to estimate the excess deaths, but also the exposures were different. The impact of high temperatures later in the summer is sometimes diminished after an early heat wave. In Europe, heat waves occurring in June result in relatively high mortality compared with those occurring later in the summer [xi]. Synergistic effects between high temperature and air pollution (Particles in the atmosphere with a diameter of less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometres (PM10) and ozone) have been observed to have led to an increase in hospital admissions as a result of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Furthermore, long warm and dry periods, in combination with other factors, can lead to forest fires, which can also have severe health impacts [xii]. Projections It is virtually certain that heat extremes will continue to become more frequent over most land areas in the future. The number of monthly heat records globally is projected to be more than 12 times as high under a medium global warming scenario by the 2040s as in a climate with no long-term warming [xiii]. The projected return period of extreme heat events, such as those experienced in 2003 in western Europe, will signicantly shorten. This increase in heat extremes will lead to a marked increase in heat-attributable deaths under future warming, unless adaptation measures are taken. Highly urbanised areas are projected to be at an increased risk of heat stress compared with surrounding areas. Projections of future heat effects on human health need to consider that the European population is projected to age, because elderly populations are especially vulnerable [xiv]. Several studies have estimated future heat-related mortality in Europe using similar methods and have arrived at largely comparable results, namely PESETA, ClimateCost and PESETAII [xv]. The PESETA study estimates that, without adaptation and physiological acclimatisation, heat-related mortality in Europe would increase by between 60000 and 165000 deaths per year by the 2080s compared with the present baseline, with the highest impacts in southern Europe. The results vary across climate models and emissions scenarios, with high emissions scenarios leading to much higher heat-related mortality than low emissions scenarios. Heat-related mortality would be significantly lower under full acclimatisation if, for example, currently cool regions were able to achieve the temperaturemortality relationship of currently warm regions [xvi]. The results from the PESETA II study confirm, to a large extent, the results of earlier assessments (in particular, those from the PESETA and ClimateCost projects), although with slightly higher impacts (both in physical and economic terms) [xvii]. Comparable estimates were made by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the WHO European Region [xviii]. Another study estimates that climate change will lead to an increase in hospital admissions owing to heat-related respiratory diseases from 11000 admissions (0.18%) in the period 19812010 to 26000 (0.4%) in 20212050. The total number of hospital admissions and the increase as a result of climate change are largest in southern Europe, with the proportion of heat-related admissions for respiratory conditions expected to approximately triple in this region over this time period [xix]. The PESETA study estimated that cold-related mortality would decrease by between 60000 and 250000 deaths per year by the 2080s, which is about the same magnitude as the projected increase in heat-related mortality [xx]. The PESETA II study no longer considers a potential reduction in cold-related mortality in its climate impact estimates [xxi]. The choice not to include cold spells reflects recent evidence that does not suggest a significant shift in the balance of deaths between winters and summers because of lower cold-related mortality [xxii]. However, the risk from (moderate) cold is expected to continue to account for most of the temperature-related risk throughout this century [xxiii].   [i] D.

"assessment  Floods and health     River and coastal flooding have affected many millions of people in Europe since 2000. Flooding affects human health through drowning, heart attacks, injuries, infections, exposure to chemical hazards and mental health consequences. Disruption of services, including health services, safe water, sanitation and transportation ways, plays a major role in vulnerability.   Observed increases in heavy precipitation and extreme coastal water levels have increased the risk of river and coastal flooding in many European regions.   In the absence of additional adaptation, the projected increases in extreme precipitation events and in sea level would substantially increase the health risks associated with river and coastal flooding in Europe.     floods climate deaths   CLIM CLIM046 046,Past trends Most regions in Europe have exhibited an increasing trend in heavy precipitation over recent decades, in particular in winter. The number of large inland floods in Europe has been increasing since the 1980s; however, there is not yet conclusive evidence that climate change has already contributed to this trend [i]. Estimates for the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region based on a combination of data from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) and the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) indicate that coastal and inland floods killed more than 2000 people and affected 8.7million in the period 20002014. Figure 1 shows the number of deaths related to flooding in each European Environment Agency (EEA) member and cooperating country for the same period, normalised by their population. The largest numbers are found in south-eastern Europe, eastern Europe and central Europe. Note that, because of the relatively short time period of 15years, the value of the indicator can be significantly affected by a single catastrophic event. For example, at least 50people were killed in massive floods in the Balkan countries in May 2014 [ii]. The EM-DAT database also includes data on people injured or (otherwise) affected by floods. This information is not presented here owing to concerns regarding the consistency with which these data are assessed and reported across countries and even for different flood events in the same country. Projections Heavy precipitation events are likely to become more frequent in many regions in Europe, and sea level rise is projected to accelerate compared with the 20th century under all emissions scenarios. The PESETAII project and the ClimateCost project have estimated the economic and health effects of river and coastal flooding under various climate change scenarios, including sea level rise. For a medium emissions scenario (IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B) and in the absence of adaptation, river flooding is estimated to affect about 300000 people per year in the EU by the 2050s and 390000 people by the 2080s; the latter figure corresponds to more than a doubling with respect to the baseline period (19611990). The British Isles, western Europe and northern Italy show a robust increase in future flood hazards; these regions also show the greatest increase in the population affected by river floods [iii]. If no additional adaptation measures were taken, the number of people affected by coastal flooding in the EU at the end of the 21st century would range from 775000 to 5.5 million people annually, depending on the emissions scenario. The number of deaths in the EU due to coastal flooding in the 2080s would increase by 3000, 620 and 150 per year under a high emissions scenario (assuming 88cm sea level rise), the SRES A1B business as usual scenario and the E1 mitigation scenario, respectively. Two-thirds of these deaths would occur in western Europe. Coastal adaptation measures (dikes and beach nourishment) could significantly reduce risks to less than 10deaths per year in 2080 [iv]. Somewhat different estimates were provided in another study [v]. Flooding is also associated with mental health impacts. Coastal flooding in the EU could potentially cause five million additional cases of mild depression annually by the end of the 21st century under a high sea level rise scenario in the absence of adaptation [vi].

"assessment  Forest fires     Fire risk depends on many factors, including climatic conditions, vegetation, forest management practices and other socio-economic factors.   The burnt area in the Mediterranean region increased from 1980 to 2000; it has decreased thereafter.   In a warmer climate, more severe fire weather and, as a consequence, an expansion of the fire-prone area and longer fire seasons are projected across Europe. The impact of fire events is particularly strong in southern Europe.     forest fires climate change impacts scenarios   CLIM CLIM035 035,Past trends The number and extent of forest fires vary considerably from one year to the next, depending on the seasonal meteorological conditions. Some multi-annual periodicity in the burned area trend can also be partially attributed to the dead biomass burning/accumulation cycle typical of the fire-prone regions. The historical trend of the number of fires is difficult to analyse because fire frequency is strongly affected by the significant changes that occurred in past years in the statistical reporting systems of the countries. Historical fire series are available in Europe and are regularly updated within the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). Data availability in EFFIS is not the same for all countries, and time series longer than 25 years are available for only a few countries. Figure 1 shows that the reported fire frequency in the five southern European countries for which long time series are available increased during the 1990s, then stabilised for around one decade, and slightly decreased during recent years. Note that these values cannot be compared across countries because of large differences across countries in the total area and the area at risk. In 2014, a large forest fire severely damaged more than 15000ha of forest land in Vstmanland County, Sweden [i]. Forest fires are also affecting new areas. For example, in 2007, wildfires moved to previously non-fire-prone ecosystems in southern Greece [ii]. Past trends of fire danger have also been analysed by processing series of meteorological fire danger indices, which are routinely used to rate the fire potential owing to weather conditions. The Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) is used in EFFIS to rate the daily fire danger conditions in Europe [iii]. Daily severity values can be averaged over the fire season obtaining a Seasonal Severity Rating (SSR) index. The index is dimensionless and allows objective comparison of fire danger from year to year and from region to region; SSR values above six may be considered in the extreme range. Figure 2 shows the current state, past trend and projections for forest fire danger based on annual SSR values, which have been computed using daily weather data including air temperature, relative humidity, wind and precipitation from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Other driving factors of fire regimes, such as land-use changes or fuel dynamics, are not taken into account by the SSR. The upper left map shows the average SSR values during the period 19812010; the lower left map shows the linear trends over this period, which indicate that there has been a significant increase in forest fire danger in several regions in Europe. Projections Climate change projections suggest substantial warming and increases in the number of droughts, heat waves and dry spells across most of the Mediterranean area and more generally in southern Europe. These projected changes would increase the length and severity of the fire season, the area at risk and the probability of large fires, possibly enhancing desertification [iv]. Figure 2 also includes fire danger projections for projected climate conditions in 20712100 (upper right map: projected state; lower right map: projected change). The results suggest that climate change would lead to a marked increase of fire potential in south-eastern and south-western Europe; in relative terms, the increase in SSR would be particularly strong in western-central Europe [v]. Similar results were obtained for other forest fire indices, such as the FWI [vi]. The PESETAII study has estimated that the burnt area in southern Europe would more than double during the 21st century for a reference climate scenario and increase by nearly 50% for a 2C scenario [vii]. Another study has estimated a potential increase in burnt areas in Europe by about 200% during the 21st century under a high emissions scenario (SRES A2) assuming no adaptation. The forest fire risk could be substantially reduced by additional adaptation measures, such as prescribed burning, fire breaks and behavioural changes [viii].

"assessment  Forest composition and distribution     Range shifts in forest tree species due to climate change have been observed towards higher altitudes and latitudes. These changes considerably affect the forest structure and the functioning of forest ecosystems and their services.   Future climate change and increasing CO2 concentrations are expected to affect site suitability, productivity, species composition and biodiversity. In general, forest growth is projected to increase in northern Europe and to decrease in southern Europe, but with substantial regional variation. Cold-adapted coniferous tree species are projected to lose large fractions of their ranges to more drought-adapted broadleaf species.   The projected changes will have an impact on the goods and services that forests provide. For example, the value of forest land in Europe is projected to decrease between 14 and 50 % during the 21st century.     changes in habitat suitability plant functional type composition forest trees climate change     CLIM CLIM034 034,Past trends Trees are slow-migrating species. Range expansion occurs primarily into newly suitable habitats at their (generally northern) latitudinal or (upper) altitudinal limit. Range contraction occurs primarily at the rear edge, which is often the most southern or the lowest lying part of their distribution range. These areas can become unsuitable for tree species as a result of direct effects (e.g. drought) or indirect effects (e.g. drought-induced pests or diseases) of climate change. In France, the altitudinal distribution of 171 forest plant species along the elevation range 02600m was studied using a 101-year data record starting in 1905. Climate warming has resulted in a significant upwards shift in species optimum elevation averaging 29m per decade, but with a wide range from +238 to 171m per decade [i]. Land-use changes are the most likely explanation of the observed significant downwards shifts in some regions [ii]. In the Montseny mountain range in north-east Spain, the altitude range of beech extended by about 70m upwards according to different data sources from the 1940s to 2001 [iii]. A study comparing data from the 1990s with data from the 2000s in the Spanish Pyrenees and the Iberian Peninsula found an average optimum elevation shift of 31m upwards per decade for five tree species, ranging between 34 and +181m per decade [iv]. Nevertheless, not all studies found clear climate signals, partly because tree species can experience time lags in their migration response to climate change [v]. In addition to range shifts, changes in forest composition have been observed in the past. In a Swedish sprucebeech forest, a long-term study covering the period since 1894 showed that spruce has been losing its competitive advantage over beech since 1960 [vi]. In north-east Spain, beech forests and heather heathlands have been replaced by holm oak forest at medium altitudes (8001400m), mainly as a result of the combination of warming temperatures and land-use change [vii]. Field-based observations from a forest inventory providing presence and absence information from 1880 to 2010 for a Mediterranean holm oak species (Quercus ilex) have been used to investigate the migration speed in the past. In four studied forests in France along the Atlantic coast, Quercus ilex has colonised a substantial amount of new space, but the northwards movement occurred at an unexpected low maximum rate of 22 to 57m/year across the four forests [viii]. Extreme climate and weather events such as droughts can have negative effects on food webs and regional tree dieback For the Iberian Peninsula, the defoliation of trees due to a water deficit rose significantly between 1987 and 2007 in all 16 examined tree species. Defoliation doubled on average, and this trend was paralleled by significant increases in tree mortality rates in drier areas [ix]. Furthermore, droughts can lead to secondary impacts on forests through pests and pathogens [x]. Projections Climate change is expected to strongly affect the biological and economic viability of different tree species in Europe, as well as competition between tree species. A study in Finland showed that climate change may lead to a local reduction of forest growth but total forest growth nationwide may increase by 44% during the 21st century [xi]. Observations and simulations of tree mitigation rates suggest that only fast-growing, early successional tree species will be able to track climate change [xii]. Recent studies that simulated forest composition and range shifts in Europe and at the global level using different climate and land-use scenarios suggest upwards shifts in the tree line and northwards migration of boreal forests [xiii]. Broadleaf tree cover in Europe is projected to increase during the 21st century under all climate scenarios, whereas needleleaf tree cover decreases, despite a northward extension in northern Europe (Figure 1). A large-scale integrated project on adaptive forest management (MOTIVE) applied an array of models (empirical as well as hybrid and process-based) in the analysis of the impacts of climate change on 38 European tree species. The results show that more drought-tolerant species such as sessile oak (Quercus petraea), pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) can be expected to become more abundant at lower altitudes throughout Europe, while other species such as beech (Fagus sylvatica), sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), lime (Tilia), elm (Ulmus) or silver fir (Abies alba) are likely to see further reductions in their ranges. Species from (sub-)Mediterranean regions such as holm oak (Quercus ilex), hop hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia) and cork oak (Quercus suber) are expected to extend their ranges to the north. Different pine species are also expected to extend their ranges quite considerably. Some species, such as Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), might face indirect threats from insects and other pest outbreaks, rather than direct threats from climate change alone. In summary, the projected range shifts will affect the forest structure quite considerably. Such changes will also affect the functioning of forest ecosystems and the services these ecosystems could provide [xiv]. Another modelling study assessed the impacts of projected climate change on forest composition across Europe and the economic consequences in terms of annual productivity and land value [xv]. It projected that the major commercial tree species in Europe, Norway spruce, will shifts northwards and to higher altitudes. It will lose large parts of its present range in central, eastern and western Europe under all scenarios (SRES A1B, A1FI and B2). Depending on the emissions scenario and climate model, between 21 and 60% (mean: 34%) of European forest lands were projected to be suitable only for a forest type of Mediterranean oak, with low economic returns by 2100, compared with 11% in the baseline period 19611990. As a result of the decline of economically valuable species, the value of forest land in Europe is projected to decrease between 14 and 50% (mean: 28% for an interest rate of 2%) by 2100. The economic loss in land estimation value is estimated at several hundred billion euros.    [i] J.

"assessment  Distribution shifts of plant and animal species     Observed climate change is having significant impacts on the distribution of European flora and fauna, with distribution changes of several hundred kilometres projected over the 21st century. These impacts include northwards and uphill range shifts, as well as local and regional extinctions of species.   The migration of many species is lagging behind the changes in climate owing to intrinsic limitations, habitat use and fragmentation, and other obstacles, suggesting that they are unable to keep pace with the speed of climate change. Observed and modelled differences between actual and required migration rates may lead to a progressive decline in European biodiversity.   Climate change is likely to exacerbate the problem of invasive species in Europe. As climatic conditions change, some locations may become more favourable to previously harmless alien species, which then become invasive and have negative impacts on their new environments.   Climate change is affecting the interaction of species that depend on each other for food or other reasons. It can disrupt established interactions but also generate novel ones.     bumblebee areas biodiversity climate change bumblebee butterflies birds      CLIM CLIM022 022,Past trends A wide variety of plant and animal species in Europe have moved northwards and uphill during recent decades. Mountain top floras across Europe have shown significant changes in species composition between 2001 and 2008, with cold-adapted species decreasing and warm-adapted species increasing in number [i]. On average, most species have moved uphill. These shifts have had opposing effects on the species richness of summit floras in boreal-temperate mountain regions (+3.9 species on average) and Mediterranean mountain regions (1.4 species) [ii]. Data from Switzerland collected over an altitudinal range of 2500m over a short period of eight years (20032010) revealed significant shifts in communities of vascular plants towards warm-dwelling species at lower altitudes. However, rates of community changes decreased with altitude [iii]. There is further evidence of increases in the distribution range due to climate change for several plant species [iv]. The distributions of many terrestrial animals have recently shifted to higher elevations. In Britain, the distributions of spiders, ground beetles, butterflies, grasshoppers and allies have shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11m per decade, and to higher latitudes at a rate of 17km per decade, but with substantial variability across and within taxonomic groups [v]. These range shifts are partly attributable to observed changes in climatic conditions, but land-use and other environmental changes also play a role [vi]. A study in the Netherlands covering the period between 1932 and 2004 found that half of the investigated bird species were overwintering significantly closer to their breeding site than in the past, most likely due to warmer winters [vii]. A long-term trend analysis of 110 common breeding birds across Europe (19802005, 20 countries) showed that species with the lowest thermal maxima showed the sharpest declining trends in abundance [viii]. In other words, cold-adapted species are losing territory most quickly. Observations for most species show an expansion at the leading edge (i.e. by expanding the range northwards and/or uphill), whereas there is less evidence for contractions at the trailing edge (i.e. at the southern margins). However, bumblebees, which are an important pollinator for agricultural and natural ecosystems, showed a different response to the observed warming in recent decades. They suffered from strong range contractions at their southern margins of up to 300km in southern Europe during the last 40 years, but failed to expand northwards, thereby experiencing a substantial compression of their range [ix]. The Community Temperature Index (CTI) is a measure of the rate of change in community composition in response to temperature change. As the CTI increases, butterfly communities become increasingly composed of species associated with warmer temperatures. For example, the CTI of butterfly communities across Europe has increased by 0.14C per decade from 1970 to 2007. However, temperature has increased by 0.39C per decade in the same period, that is, almost three times faster than the butterfly community could move northwards [x]. The finding that the movement of animal species is unable to keep pace with climate change has been confirmed in an analysis of the CTI of several thousand local bird and butterfly communities across Europe (see Figure 1) [xi]. A comprehensive review study on amphibians and reptiles found that 20 out of the 21 amphibian and four out of the five reptilian species assessed in Europe were already affected by climate change. The reported effects were negative, mainly through population declines, reductions in habitat suitability, and reduced survival and range sizes, in more than 90% for amphibians and in more than 60% for reptiles [xii]. A review study on ducks (Anatidae), which are major elements of wetland biodiversity, reports shifts in winter distribution range and phenology. Nevertheless, a phenological mismatch between the periods of peak energy requirements for young and peak seasonal food availability was not found in general with regard to ducks [xiii]. The contribution of the Arctic to global biodiversity is substantial, as the region supports globally significant populations of birds, mammals and fish. The Arctic Species Trend Index (ASTI) has been tracking trends in 306 Arctic species. An analysis of the ASTI over 34 years (19702004) has shown that the abundance of High Arctic vertebrates declined by 26% whereas Low Arctic vertebrate species increased in abundance. Sub-Arctic species did not show a trend over the whole time period, but seem to have declined since the mid-1980s [xiv]. There is some evidence that climate change has already played a role in the spread of alien animal species in Europe. Projections The observed northwards and uphill movement of many plant and animal species is projected to continue in the current century. Threatened endemic species with specific requirements of the ecotope or a small distribution range will generally be at greatest risk, in particular if they face migration barriers [xv]. A modelling study comprising 150 high-mountain plant species across the European Alps projects average range size reductions of 4450% by the end of the 21st century [xvi]. An assessment of the impacts of climate change on 2632 plant species across all major European mountain ranges under four future climate scenarios projected that habitat loss by 20702100 will be greater for species distributed at higher elevations [xvii]. Depending on the climate scenario, up to 3655% of Alpine plant species, 3151% of sub-Alpine plant species and 1946% of montane plant species are projected to lose more than 80% of their suitable habitat. Nevertheless, at the finer scale, microclimate heterogeneity may enable species to persist under climate change in so called micro-climatic refugia [xviii]. A Europe-wide study of the stability of 856 plant species under climate change indicated that the mean stable area of species decreases significantly in Mediterranean scrubland, grassland and warm mixed forests [xix]. The rate of climate change is expected to exceed the ability of many plant species to migrate, especially as landscape fragmentation may restrict movement [xx]. A recent study has analysed the likely shifts in distribution for 3048 plants and animals in England. Of those species, 640 (21%) were classified as being at high risk owing to the loss of substantial parts of their current distributions as a result of a 2C rise in global temperatures [xxi]. Animals generally have a greater capacity than plants to escape unfavourable climatic conditions because of their greater mobility, but they are also affected by climate change. A study based on bioclimatic envelope modelling for 120 native terrestrial European mammals under two climate scenarios showed that 1% or 59% of European mammals risk extinction [xxii]. Another study simulated phylogenetic diversity for plants, birds and mammals in an ensemble of forecasts for 2020, 2050 and 2080 [xxiii]. The results show that the tree of life faces a homogenisation across the continent as a result of a reduction in phylogenetic diversity in southern Europe (where immigration from northern Africa was not considered) and gains in high latitudes and altitudes. The limited dispersal ability of many reptiles, amphibians and butterflies, combined with the fragmentation of habitats, is very likely to reduce and isolate the ranges of many of those species [xxiv]. A study on the effects of projected climate change on 181 terrestrial mammals in the Mediterranean region projected average declines in species ranges between 11 and 45%, depending on the climate scenario and assumptions regarding dispersal [xxv]. Under a scenario of 3C warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100, the ranges of European breeding birds are projected to shift by about 550km to the north-east, whereby average range size would be reduced by 20%. Arctic, sub-Arctic and some Iberian species are projected to suffer the greatest range losses [xxvi]. A comprehensive assessment simulated the current climatic niche and future climatically suitable conditions for almost all European bumblebee species based on over one million records from the STEP projectand three climate change scenarios for the years 2050 and 2100 (see Figure 2). The number of species on the verge of extinction by 2100 ranges from three (5% of assessed species) under the lowest climate scenario to 25 (45% of species) under the highest scenario; under the highest scenario, 53 out of 56 assessed species (95%) would lose the main part of their suitable habitat [xxvii]. The risk of exposure to extreme climates was investigated using four global circulation model outputs and three emissions scenarios. In total, 1149 species were simulated (104 amphibians, 248 reptiles, 288 mammals and 509 breeding birds). The results showed that the main hotspots of biodiversity for terrestrial vertebrates may be significantly influenced by climate change, with a regional hotspot in the Mediterranean [xxviii]. In the Arctic and sub-Arctic, warmer and wetter future conditions allow a considerable number of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and birds to expand their distribution range. However, various species (especially habitat specialists) are expected to contract their range over time. Furthermore, a number of new species are predicted to be able to invade the region, altering community composition and biotic interactions in ways difficult to anticipate [xxix]. As the climatic conditions of some locations in Europe change, they may become more favourable to the establishment and survival of alien species, making native species, communities and ecosystems more vulnerable [xxx]. On the other hand, climate change may also offer some opportunities to control alien species that are predicted to suffer from climate change. Whereas some components of global change, such as rising CO2, usually promote invasion, other components, such as changing temperature and precipitation, can help or hinder plant invasion. Therefore, in some cases climate change can offer unprecedented opportunities for restoration of species distribution.

"assessment  Phenology of plant and animal species     The timing of seasonal events has changed across Europe. A general trend towards earlier spring phenological stages (spring advancement) has been shown in many plant and animal species, mainly due to changes in climate conditions.   As a consequence of climate-induced changes in plant phenology, the pollen season starts on average 10 days earlier than it did and is longer than it was in the 1960s.   The life cycles of many animal groups have advanced in recent decades, with events occurring earlier in the year, including frogs spawning, birds nesting and the arrival of migrant birds and butterflies. This advancement is attributed primarily to a warming climate.   The breeding season of many thermophilic insects (such as butterflies, dragonflies and bark beetles) has been lengthening, allowing, in principle, more generations to be produced per year.   The observed trends are expected to continue into the future. However, simple extrapolations of current phenological trends may be misleading because the observed relationship between temperature and phenological events may change in the future.     species specific trends CLIM CLIM023 023,Past trends A variety of studies show that there has been a general trend for plant, fungi and animal species to advance their springtime phenology over the past 2050 years [i]. An analysis of 315 species of fungi in England showed that, on average, they increased their fruiting season from 33 to 75 days between 1950 and 2005 [ii]. Furthermore, climate warming and changes in the temporal allocation of nutrients to roots seem to have caused significant numbers of plant species to begin fruiting in spring as well as autumn. A study on 53 plant species in the United Kingdom found that they have advanced leafing, flowering and fruiting on average by 5.8 days between 1976 and 2005 [iii]. Similarly, 29 perennial plant species in Spain have advanced leaf unfolding on average by 4.8 days, with first flowering having advanced by 5.9 days and fruiting by 3.2 days over the period 19432003, whereas leaf senescence was delayed on average by 1.2 days [iv]. For plants, a medium spring advancement of four to five days per 1C increase has been observed in Europe [v]. Short warm and cold spells also can have a significant effect on phenological events, but this depends strongly on their timing and the species [vi]. Remote sensing data can support the estimation of the trend of phenological phases over large areas. Continental-scale change patterns have been derived from time series of satellite-measured phenological variables (19822006) [vii]. North-eastern Europe showed a trend towards an earlier and longer growing season, particularly in the northern Baltic areas. Despite the earlier leafing, large areas of Europe exhibited a rather stable season length, indicating that the entire growing season has shifted to an earlier period. The northern Mediterranean displayed on average a shift in the growing season towards later in the year, while some instances of earlier and shorter growing seasons were also seen. The correlation of phenological time series with climate data shows a cause-and-effect relationship over the semi-natural areas. In contrast, managed ecosystems have a heterogeneous change pattern with less or no correlation with climatic trends. Over these areas, climatic trends seemed to overlap in a complex manner, with more pronounced effects of local biophysical conditions and/or land management practices. One study demonstrated that the growing season was starting earlier between 2001 and 2011 for the majority of temperate deciduous forests in western Europe, with the most likely cause being regional spring warming effects experienced during the same period [viii]. A combination of ground observations and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) both indicated that spring phenology significantly advanced during the period 19822011 in central Europe. The average trend of 4.5 days advancement per decade was not uniform and weakened over the last decade investigated, where ground observations and NDVI observations showed different trends (see Figure 1). One possible explanation for the weakening trend from 2000 to 2010 is the response of early spring species to the cooling trend in late winter during that time frame [ix]. However, while individual studies find good agreement between in situ observations and experimental warming, a meta-analysis [x] suggests that experiments can substantially under predict advances in the timing of flowering and leafing of plants in comparison with observational studies. The phenology of numerous animals has advanced significantly in response to recent climate change [xi]. Several studies have convincingly demonstrated that the life-cycle traits of animals are strongly dependent on ambient temperatures, in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats [xii]. Mostly, the observed warming leads to an advanced timing of life history events. For example, temporal trends for the appearance dates of two insect species (honey bee, Apis mellifera, and small white butterfly, Pieris rapae) in more than 1000 localities in Spain have closely followed variations in recorded spring temperatures between 1952 and 2004 [xiii]. The predicted egg-laying date for the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) showed significant advancement between 1980 and 2004 in western and central Europe, but delays in northern Europe, both trends depending on regional temperature trends in the relevant season [xiv]. Data from four monitoring stations in south to mid-Norway of nest boxes of the pied flycatcher from 1992 to 2011 show, contrary to the regional temperature estimated trends, that there were no significant delays in the egg-laying date for the pied flycatcher, but there was an annual fluctuation, making a rather flat curve for the median over these years [xv]. Two studies on Swedish butterfly species showed that the average advancement of the mean flight date was 3.6 days per decade since the 1990s [xvi]. Of the 66 investigated butterfly species, 57 showed an advancement of the mean flight date, which was significant for 45 species. A study from the United Kingdom found that each of the 44 species of butterfly investigated advanced its date of first appearance since 1976 [xvii]. A study indicated that average rates of phenological change have recently accelerated in line with accelerated warming trends [xviii]. There is also increasing evidence about climate-induced changes in spring and autumn migration, including formerly migratory bird species becoming resident [xix]. Warmer temperatures shorten the development period of European pine sawfly larvae (Neodiprion sertifer), reducing the risk of predation and potentially increasing the risk of insect outbreaks, but interactions with other factors, including day length and food quality, may complicate this prediction [xx]. Warmer temperatures also extend the growing season. This means that plants need more water to keep growing or they will dry out, increasing the risk of failed crops and wildfires. The shorter, milder winters that follow might fail to kill dormant insects, increasing the risk of large, damaging infestations in subsequent seasons. For climate change factors other than temperature, the phenology of emissions of volatile compounds from flowers seems affected not only by warming or drought but also by the phenological changes in the presence of pollinators. Nevertheless, experimental evidence suggests that phenological effects on pollinatorplant synchrony may be of limited importance [xxi]. Projections Phenology is primarily seen as an indicator to observe the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and their constituent species. However, an extrapolation of the observed relationship between temperature and phenological events into the future can provide an initial estimate of future changes in phenology. Plants and animal species unable to adjust their phenological behaviour will be negatively affected, particularly in highly seasonal habitats [xxii]. Obviously, there are limits to possible changes in phenology, beyond which ecosystems have to adapt by changes in species composition. For six dominant European tree species, flushing is expected to advance in the next decades, but this trend substantially differed between species (from 0 to 2.4 days per decade) [xxiii]. Interestingly, the projected advancement is quite similar to the recently observed rates and does not increase, as could have been expected from increasingly rising temperatures. This might indicate some physiological limitations in temporal adaptation to climate change. Leaf senescence of two deciduous species, which is more difficult to predict, is expected to be delayed by 1.4 to 2.3 days per decade. Earlier spring leafing and later autumn senescence are likely to affect the competitive balance between species. Species unable to adjust their phenological behaviour will be negatively affected, particularly in highly seasonal habitats. For instance, many late-succession temperate trees require a chilling period in winter, followed by a threshold in day length, and only then are sensitive to temperature. As a result, simple projections of current phenological trends may be misleading, as the relative importance of influencing factors can change [xxiv]. Projections for animal phenology are mainly carried out for species of high economic interest [xxv]. Quantitative projections are hampered by the high natural variability in phenological data, particularly in insects [xxvi]. The projected future warming is expected to cause further shifts in animal phenology, with both positive and negative impacts on biodiversity. For example, increasing spring temperatures may have positive fitness effects in sand lizard populations in Sweden [xxvii]. Nevertheless, climate change can lead to an increase of trophic mismatching, unforeseeable outbreaks of species, a decrease of specialist species and changes in ecosystem functioning [xxviii]. A recent study suggests that many pollinator species are not threatened by phenological decoupling from specific flowering plants [xxix]. Other studies simulated the consequences of the phenological shifts in plantpollinator networks and found that the breadth of the diet of pollinators might decrease because of the reduced overlap between plants and pollinators and that extinctions of plants, pollinators and their crucial interactions could be expected as consequences of these disruptions. Empirical evidence shows that climate change over the last 120 years has resulted in phenological shifts that caused interaction mismatches between flowering plants and bee pollinators. As a consequence, many bee species were extirpated from this system, potentially as a result of climate-induced phenological shifts. Although the plantpollinator interaction networks are quite flexible, redundancy has been reduced, interaction strengths have weakened and pollinator service has declined [xxx].   [i] Benjamin I.

"assessment  Water temperature     Water temperatures in major European rivers have increased by 13 C over the last century. Several time series show increasing lake and river temperatures all over Europe since the early 1900s.   Lake and river surface water temperatures are projected to increase further with projected increases in air temperature.   Increased water temperature can result in marked changes in species composition and functioning of aquatic ecosystems.     climate change impacts rivers and lake temperature  CLIM CLIM019 019,Past trends The surface water temperatures of major rivers in Europe have increased by 13C over the last century (Figure 1). For example, the average temperature in the Rhine near Basel, Switzerland, has risen by more than 2C since the 1960s [i]. The temperature of the downstream part of the Rhine increased by nearly 3C between 1910 and 2013. A similar increase of 2.4C has been observed in the Meuse. Two-thirds of the increase of the downstream part of the Rhine is attributed to the increased use of cooling water and one-third is attributed to the increase in air temperature as a result of climate change [ii]. The annual average temperature of the Danube increased by around by 1C during the 20th century [iii]. Increases in surface water temperature were also found in lakes. Lake Vrtsjrv in Estonia had a 0.7C increase between 1947 and 2014, and the summer (August) water temperature of Lake Saimaa, Finland, increased by more than 1C over the last century (Figure 1). Many other time series indicate a general trend of increasing water temperature in European rivers and lakes in the range of 0.05 to 0.8C per decade, with some water bodies warming by more than 1C per decade [iv]. Projections Inland surface water temperatures are projected to increase further, in parallel with the projected increases in air temperature. The exact amount of warming depends on the magnitude of air temperature increase, on the region, on the season and on lake properties and river catchment. An average increase in summer surface water temperature of 2C (1.22.9C) by 2050 has been estimated for 15 Austrian lakes, depending on the present thermal regime and geographical region [v]. A global study estimated that mean river water temperatures of major European rivers will increase by 1.62.1C during the 21st century (20712100 relative to 19712000, mean of a General circulation model (GCM) ensemble driven by IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 and B1 scenarios) [vi]. A detailed assessment for the Rhine gives an estimated increase in mean annual and August temperature in the range of 3.03.5C during the 21st century, due to climate change. The number of days with water temperatures above 25C, which is the threshold for significant stress to river fauna and flora, would increase at least five-fold (e.g. from 215 days in the reference period 20012010 to 3275 days in 20712100) [vii].

"assessment  River floods     Almost 1 500 floods have been reported for Europe since 1980, of which more than half have occurred since 2000.   The number of very severe flood events in Europe increased over the period 19802010, but with large interannual variability. This increase has been attributed to better reporting, land-use changes and increased heavy precipitation in parts of Europe, but it is not currently possible to quantify the importance of these factors.   Global warming is projected to intensify the hydrological cycle and increase the occurrence and frequency of flood events in large parts of Europe.   Pluvial floods and flash floods, which are triggered by intense local precipitation events, are likely to become more frequent throughout Europe. In regions with projected reduced snow accumulation during winter, the risk of early spring flooding could decrease. However, quantitative projections of changes in flood frequency and magnitude remain highly uncertain.     climate change impacts floods projections river floods rcp0.5     CLIM CLIM017 017,Past trends Figure 1 shows that the number of very severe flood events in Europe increased over the period 19802010, but with large interannual variability. The underlying data is obtained from a combination of information available in global databases such as the Dartmouth Flood Observatory([1]) and the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED)([2]), data reported by EU Member States under the EU Floods Directive and an additional country consultation in all EEA member and cooperating countries [i]. Less extreme events or events with small spatial extent are not included, but the combination of data sources still leads to a large improvement over an overview based on global data sources only. Furthermore, selection of larger floods only (here with severity class very high) is expected to reduce the reporting bias [ii]. For comparison, the NatCatSERVICE database in total contains more than 1200 flood events that have happened since 1990, which, on average, is over 50 per year. Losses from flooding in Europe have increased substantially since the 1970s [iii]. In recent years, some flood events have been so much stronger than previous events that they have led to significant changes in flood risk estimation methods for that region, e.g. in the United Kingdom [iv]. The trend for increasing losses from river floods is primarily attributable to socio-economic factors, such as increasing wealth located in flood zones, but increases in heavy precipitation in parts of Europe may also play a role. Robust attribution is not yet possible because of insufficient data [v]. In terms of regional GDP, flood risks are highest in large parts of eastern Europe, Scandinavia, Austria and the United Kingdom and parts of France and Italy [vi]. A shift from a purely technically oriented flood defense toward a more integrated flood risk management system that also considers nonstructural measures to minimize adverse effects of flooding has led to more effective flood management and to a reduction of damage caused by the 2013 floods in Germany, compared to the 2002 floods [vii]. Projections Future changes in the risk of river floods in Europe have been simulated using a hydrological model driven by an ensemble of climate simulations [viii]. Of particular interest is the frequency analysis of flood peaks above the 100-year flood level, which is the average protection level of the European river network (albeit with significant differences) [ix]. Figure 2 shows the change in the level of one-in-a-century (Q100) floods between the reference period and three future time periods based on the hydrological model LISFLOOD and an ensemble of seven climate models [x]. Blue rivers indicate an increase in flood level and red rivers indicate a decrease. For the end of the 21st century, the greatest increase in Q100 floods is projected for the British Isles, north-west and south-east France, northern Italy and some regions in south-east Spain, the Balkans and the Carpathians. Mild increases are projected for central Europe, the upper section of the Danube and its main tributaries. In contrast, decreases in Q100 floods are projected in large parts of north-eastern Europe owing to a reduction in snow accumulation, and hence melt-associated floods, under milder winter temperatures. These results are consistent with earlier studies [xi]. While the ensemble mean presented in Figure 2 provides the best assessment of all model simulations together, individual simulations can show important differences from the ensemble mean for individual catchments. This is partly the result of significant decadal-scale internal variability in the simulated climate [xii]. Furthermore, the LISFLOOD analysis is restricted to the larger rivers in Europe, which may not be representative of a whole country or region. For example, in northern Europe, rainfall-dominated floods in smaller rivers may increase because of projected increases in precipitation amounts, even where snowmelt-dominated floods in large rivers are projected to decrease [xiii]. Changes in flood frequencies below the protection level are expected to have less significant economic effects and affect fewer people than even small changes in the largest events (e.g. with a return period of 500years). For a number of European river basins, including the Po, Duero, Garonne, Ebro, Loire, Rhine and Rhone, an increase in extreme floods with a return period above 500 years is projected; this includes river basins such as Guadiana and Narva, where the overall frequency of flood events is projected to decline [xiv]. A follow-up study combined the results of this flood hazard assessment with detailed exposure maps to estimate the economic and health risks from river floods in Europe. The results suggest that a high climate change scenario could increase the socio-economic impact of floods in Europe more than three-fold by the end of the 21st century. The strongest increase in flood risk is projected for Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia [xv]. A combination of different adaptation measures has been estimated to reduce economic damage from (fluvial and coastal) floods substantially by 67 to 99% and reduce the number of people flooded by 37 to 99% for the 100-year event [xvi].

"assessment  River flow     Available studies suggest that run-off in near-natural rivers during the period 19632000 increased in western and northern Europe, in particular in winter, and decreased in southern and parts of eastern Europe, in particular in summer. However, comprehensive observation data on river flows are not available across Europe.   Long-term trends in river flows due to climate change are difficult to detect because of substantial interannual and decadal variability, as well as modifications to natural water flows arising from water abstractions, morphological changes (such as man-made reservoirs) and land-use changes.   Climate change is projected to result in significant changes in the seasonality of river flows across Europe. Summer flows are projected to decrease in most of Europe, including in regions where annual flows are projected to increase. Where precipitation shifts from snow to rain, spring and summer peak flow will shift to earlier in the season.     change in river flow change in streamflow climate change   CLIM CLIM016 016,Past trends Human interventions in catchments, including water abstractions, river regulation and land-use change, have considerably altered river flow regimes in large parts of Europe, making it difficult to discern any climate-driven changes in river flow data. An inventory of river flows in Europe was produced by combining over 400 time series (from 1962 to 2004) of river catchments with near-natural flow conditions for Europe and an ensemble of eight large-scale hydrological models (for 19632000) [i]. According to this inventory, run-off showed positive trends in western and northern Europe and negative trends in southern and parts of eastern Europe (Figure 1). The European pattern of annual run-off trends modelled by the ensemble mean shows a regionally coherent picture. The areas where models disagreed on the trend direction were largely located in areas of weak trends, notably in the transition areas between regions with consistent negative and positive trends. The pattern of changes in regional high flows is very similar to the pattern of changes in annual flows, whereas summer low flows have also decreased in various regions where annual flows have increased. Overall, positive trends in annual stream flow appear to reflect the marked wetting trends of the winter months, whereas negative annual trends result primarily from a widespread decrease in stream flow in spring and summer months, consistent with a decrease in summer low flow in large parts of Europe. The model uncertainties were largest in complex terrain with high spatial variability and in snow-dominated regimes. The magnitude of the observed seasonal changes clearly raises concerns for water resource management both today and in future decades. To date, however, despite the evidence of changes in the seasonality of flows, there is no conclusive evidence that low river flows have generally become more severe or frequent in Europe during recent decades [ii]. Whereas many studies detect significant hydrological changes in observed datasets, more scientific rigour is needed in the attribution of river flow changes, as these studies often fall short in proving and quantifying the relationship between these changes and potential drivers [iii]. Projections Annual river flows are projected to decrease in southern and south-eastern Europe and increase in northern and north-eastern Europe [iv]. Changes are projected in the seasonality of river flows, with large differences across Europe. For most parts of Europe, the peak of the average daily flow at the end of the 21st century is projected to occur earlier in the year than currently [v]. In snow-dominated regions, such as the Alps, Scandinavia and parts of the Baltic, the reduction in winter retention as snow, earlier snowmelt and, in some cases, reduced summer precipitation are projected to lead to increases in river flows in winter and reductions in summer [vi]. Reductions of flow can be exacerbated by water abstractions, especially in summer when consumption is highest and input is typically low. These changes result in a further decrease of water availability in summer (see Figure 2) [vii].   [i] K.

"assessment  Ocean oxygen content      Dissolved oxygen in sea water affects the metabolism of species. Therefore, reductions in oxygen content (i.e. hypoxic or anoxic areas) can lead to changes in the distribution of species, including so called dead zones.   Globally, oxygen-depleted areas have expanded very rapidly in recent decades. The number of dead zones has roughly doubled every decade since the 1960s and has increased from about 20 in the 1950s to about 400 in the 2000s.   Oxygen-depleted zones in the Baltic Sea have increased more than 10-fold, from 5 000 to 60 000 km 2 , since 1900, with most of the increase happening after 1950. The Baltic Sea now has the largest dead zone in the world. Oxygen depletion has also been observed in other European seas in recent decades.   The primary cause of oxygen depletion is nutrient input from agricultural fertilisers, causing eutrophication. The effects of eutrophication are exacerbated by climate change, in particular increases in sea temperature and in water-column stratification.     eutrophication oxygen-depleted oxygen depletion observed hypoxia baltic sea climate change adaptation      CLIM CLIM054 054,Past trends Dissolved oxygen in marine ecosystems has changed drastically in a very short period compared with other variables of the marine environment. While hypoxic zones occur naturally in some regions, increased nutrient loads from agricultural fertilisers have caused oxygen-depleted areas or even anoxic areas (so-called dead zones) to expand globally since the mid-20th century. The number of dead zones globally has increased from about 20 in the 1950s to about 400 in the 2000s [i]. Extensive areas with oxygen depletion or even anoxic areas have been observed for decades in all European seas (Figure 1) [ii]. The largest area of human-induced hypoxia in Europe, and in fact globally, is found within the Baltic Sea (including the adjacent seas towards the North Sea). The Baltic Sea is a shallow basin with restricted inlets, meaning that the water has a high residence time, making this water body prone to hypoxia. Hypoxic areas in the Baltic Sea have increased more than 10-fold, from 5000 to 60000km2, since 1900, with most of the increase happening after 1950 (Figure 2). This expansion is primarily linked to increased inputs of nutrients from the land, but increased respiration from higher temperatures during the last two decades (since the early 1990s) has contributed to worsening oxygen levels [iii]. Oxygen depletion initially affects benthic organisms (i.e. those living on or in the seabed). Benthic organisms carry out important ecosystem functions, such as bioturbation, bioirrigation and sediment nutrient cycling. Benthic organisms also play a crucial role in the marine food web, so reductions in benthic organisms can have large impacts to commercial fisheries. The loss of benthic macrofauna in the Baltic Sea (including adjacent seas) as a result of hypoxia has been estimated at 3 million tonnes or about 30% of Baltic secondary production [iv]. Projections Sea surface temperature is projected to continue to increase in the Baltic Sea and other European seas. As a result, oxygen-depleted areas will further expand, in particular in the Baltic Sea, unless nutrient intakes are reduced [v]. The combined effects of oxygen loss and ocean warming could force polewards movement and vertical contraction of metabolic viable habitats and species distribution ranges during this century [vi].

"assessment  Distribution shifts of marine species     Increases in regional sea temperatures have triggered a major northwards expansion of warmer water plankton and a northwards retreat of colder water plankton in the North-east Atlantic. This northerly movement has amounted to about 10  latitude (1 100 km) over the past 40 years, and it seems to have accelerated since 2000.   Sub-tropical species are occurring with increasing frequency in Europes seas, and sub-Arctic species are receding northwards.   Wild fish stocks are responding to changing temperatures and food supply by changing their distribution. This can have impacts on those local communities that depend on those fish stocks.   Further changes in the distribution of marine species, including fish stocks, are expected with the projected climate change, but quantitative projections of these distribution changes are not widely available.     climate change CLIM CLIM015 015,Past trends Increases in regional sea temperatures have triggered a major northwards movement of species. As a result, sub-tropical species are occurring with increasing frequency in European waters, and sub-Arctic species are receding northwards. However, in areas with geographical constraints, i.e. where a coastline hinders northwards movement, some species shift into deeper and cooler waters [i]. Some examples are provided below. Plankton in the Greater North Sea have shown a northerly movement of about 10 latitude over the past 40 years. This corresponds to a mean polewards movement of around 250km per decade, which appears to have accelerated since 2000 [ii]. As a result, the ratio of the coldwater Calanus finmarchicus to the warmwater Calanus helgolandicus copepod species has changed considerably over time (Figure 1). While C. helgolandicus is becoming more abundant in the North Sea, the overall Calanus biomass has declined by 70% since the 1960s [iii]. Such rapid shifts in distribution range can reorganise marine species communities and have an impact on human communities that depend on them. For example, it has been shown that occurrences of European sprat are positively correlated with C. finmarchicus, while species such as Atlantic horse mackerel are positively correlated with C. helgolandicus [iv]. Benthic invertebrates are also shifting their distribution range as temperatures change in the Greater North Sea, but their response lags behind the temperature increase. Unless the individual species are able to withstand a change in thermal regime, this mismatch could lead to a drop in benthic diversity [v]. Such reorganisation will have an impact upon human communities and challenge traditional approaches to management of, for example fisheries, which have to consider species responses to temperature when planning future fishing opportunities [vi]. Very fast rates of northwards movement were observed in the coastal waters of southern Norway from 1997 and 2010. About 1600 benthic marine species were found, and of these 565 species had expanded their distribution northwards along the coast, at rates of 500800km per decade [vii]. Phytoplankton and highly mobile pelagic species are the fastest migrating organisms; their migration rate can be an order of magnitude faster than those of terrestrial species [viii]. Increases in the surface temperature of the North Sea in recent decades have triggered establishment of warmwater swimming crabs, which in turn has allowed establishment of colonies of lesser black-backed gulls in Belgium and northern France [ix]. There is also evidence that the overwintering distributions of many water birds have changed. In recent decades, in response to warming, their distributions have shifted northwards and eastwards out of the United Kingdom [x]. In the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the introduction of warmwater and tropical alien species from the Red Sea has been exacerbated by observed warming, leading to a 150% increase in the annual mean rate of species entry after 1998 [xi]. Impacts on fisheries Climate change is also affecting fish stocks of commercial interest. Wild fish stocks seem to be responding to changing temperatures and food supply by changing their geographical distribution and their phenology. Mackerel and horse mackerel are spawning earlier in the English Channel, and both earlier and further north on the Porcupine Bank (off the west coast of Ireland). International commercial landings from the North-east Atlantic Ocean of fish species identified as warm-adapted (e.g. grey gurnard, red mullet and hake) have increased by 250% since the 1980s, while landings of cold-adapted species (e.g. cod, haddock and whiting) have halved [xii]. A striking example for the potentially large economic consequences of the northwards movement of marine species is the recent establishment of the Northeast Atlantic mackerel in Greenlandic waters. This temperature-sensitive epipelagic fish was first observed in Greenlandic waters in 2011, following record-high summer temperatures. Following the rapid development of a large-scale fishery, mackerel already contributed 23% to the export value of all goods from Greenland in 2014 [xiii]. In the North-east Atlantic Ocean, 72% of commonly observed fish species have responded to warming waters by changing their abundance and/or distribution (Figure 2). Traditionally exploited fish species have moved further northwards in the region, while new species have moved in, most likely as a result of a shift in the thermal regime. While warming can lead to an increase in fish biodiversity in a region, there is often a concurrent decrease in the size structure of the fish population. For example, in the Greater North Sea, the relatively small species sprat, anchovy and horse mackerel have increased in recent decades, whereas the larger species cod and plaice have decreased at their southern distribution limit [xiv]. This change may have important socio-economic consequences, as the stocks moving out tend to have a higher value than the stocks moving in. Pronounced changes in community structures and species interactions of demersal fish are projected over the next 50 years, as fish will experience constraints in the availability of suitable habitat [xv]. Global projections of changes in total catch of marine fish and invertebrates in response to ocean warming suggest a large-scale redistribution of global catch potential, with an increase in high-latitude regions and a decline in the tropics. In Europe, a considerable increase in catch potential is expected in the Arctic [xvi]. Projections As sea surface temperatures increase, marine species will continue to seek out the most optimal temperature regime for their metabolic demands, thus leading to further northwards movement of marine species. However, quantitative projections are not widely available. Furthermore, non-indigenous species might become invasive if conditions favour their metabolic demands, while native species are weakened [xvii].   [i] Nicholas K.

"assessment  Sea surface temperature     All European seas have warmed considerably since 1870, and the warming has been particularly rapid since the late 1970s. The multi-decadal rate of sea surface temperature rise during the satellite era (since 1979) has been between 0.21 C per decade in the North Atlantic and 0.40 C per decade in the Baltic Sea.   Globally averaged sea surface temperature is projected to continue to increase, although more slowly than atmospheric temperature.     water water temperature  CSI CSI046 CLIM CLIM013 046 013,Past trends The production of consistent, long time series of SST faces challenges owing to different measurement devices (in situmeasurements from ships and buoys, as well as remote measurements from satellites), associated different definitions (e.g. water depth and time of day of measurement), different bias correction methods, and different interpolation methods to account for incomplete spatial and temporal coverage. As a result, substantially different values for absolute SST and for SST trends may be reported for a particular ocean basin, depending on the underlying global or regional SST dataset. In fact, there is still considerable uncertainty about the trend in global SST for the recent period 19792012 [i]. Furthermore, observed SST trends for regional seas reflect the combined effects of anthropogenic warming and natural climate variability (e.g.Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) [ii]. Despite those uncertainties, it is undisputed that SST has been increasing globally and in Europe during the last century. The current indicator primarily uses information from the Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST1) dataset [iii]. Information on the Mediterranean for the satellite era is complemented by data from the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The trends, although not necessarily the absolute SST levels, are consistent between HadISST1 and available high-resolution SST datasets for the regional seas (Mediterranean Sea, Baltic Sea and North Sea). The trends reported here cannot be directly compared with those in previous versions of this indicator, which used different underlying datasets. All European seas have warmed considerably since 1870, and the warming has been particularly rapid since the late 1970s (Figure 1). The multi-decadal rate of SST rise during the satellite era (19792015) has been between 0.21C per decade in the North Atlantic and 0.40C per decade in the Baltic Sea. Projections It is very likely that globally averaged ocean temperatures at the surface and for different ocean depths will further increase in the near-term and beyond. Owing to the thermal inertia of the ocean, global SST is projected to rise more slowly than atmospheric temperature [iv]. Quantitative SST projections are available only for some regional seas in Europe [v]. For the Baltic Sea, the increase in summer SST during the 21st century under medium to high emissions scenarios is projected to be about 2C in the southern parts and about 4C in the northern parts [vi]. An increase in harmful algal blooms, with increased risks to human health, ecosystems and aquaculture, has been projected for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea as a result of the projected warming [vii].

"assessment  Ocean heat content     The warming of the oceans has accounted for approximately 93 % of the warming of the Earth since the 1950s. Warming of the upper (0700 m) ocean accounted for about 64 % of the total heat uptake.   A trend for increasing heat content in the upper ocean has become evident since the 1950s. Recent observations also show substantial warming of the deeper ocean (between depths of 700 and 2 000 m and below 3 000 m).   Further warming of the oceans is expected with the projected climate change. The amount of warming is strongly dependent on the emissions scenario.     global heat marine ocean   CLIM CLIM044 044,Past trends The warming of the oceans has accounted for approximately 93% of the warming of the Earth since the 1950s [i]. Ocean heat content (OHC) has increased since around 1970 (Figure 1). Differences in the values for yearly and five-yearly averages are the result of the particular method used for spatial gap filling. The linear warming trends of the uppermost 700m of the ocean and the 7002000m layer over the time period 19552013 were 0.27W/m2 and 0.39W/m2 (per unit area of the ocean), respectively. It is likely that the ocean warmed between 700 and 2000m from 1957 to 2014 and between 3000m and the bottom of the ocean from 1992 to 2005, while trends in ocean temperature between depths of 2000 and 3000m were not statistically significant [ii]. Two-thirds of the observed increase in OHC has occurred in the upper 700m of the ocean, with increases in the layers below a depth of 700m accounting for the remaining third. The strongest warming is found near the sea surface, with the upper 75m having warmed by more than 0.1C per decade since 1971. It has been estimated that heat uptake has doubled in recent decades [iii]. At a depth of 700m, the warming decreases to about 0.015C per decade [iv]. Recently, it has been determined that past increases in OHC have been substantially underestimated because of poor sampling of the Southern Hemisphere and limitations of the analysis methods [v]. These concerns have not yet been considered in the datasets presented here. Projections All available ocean temperature projections suggest that the global ocean will continue to warm. The largest warming is projected for the upper few hundred metres of the sub-tropical gyres, similar to the observed pattern of ocean temperature changes. Mixing and advection processes will gradually transfer the additional heat to deeper levels. The rate of increase of OHC is approximately proportional to the global mean change in surface air temperature. Under the low-to-medium (RCP4.5) emissions scenario, half of the energy taken up by the ocean by the end of the 21st century will be by the uppermost 700m, and 85% will be by the uppermost 2000m. Projected ocean warming varies considerably across forcing scenarios. Globally averaged projected surface warming ranges from about 1C for RCP2.6 to more than 3C for RCP8.5 during the 21st century, and at a depth of 1000m ranges from 0.5C for RCP2.6 to 1.5C for RCP8.5[vi].

"assessment  Ocean acidification     Ocean surface pH has declined from 8.2 to below 8.1 over the industrial era as a result of the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This decline corresponds to an increase in oceanic acidity of about 30 %.   Ocean acidification in recent decades has been occurring 100 times faster than during past natural events over the last 55 million years.   Observed reductions in surface water pH are nearly identical across the global ocean and throughout continental European seas, except for variations near the coast. The pH reduction in the northernmost European seas, i.e. the Norwegian Sea and the Greenland Sea, is larger than the global average.   Ocean acidification already reaches into the deep ocean, particularly at the high latitudes.   Models consistently project further ocean acidification worldwide. Ocean surface pH is projected to decrease to values between 8.05 and 7.75 by the end of 21st century, depending on future CO2 emissions levels. The largest projected decline represents more than a doubling in acidity.   Ocean acidification is affecting marine organisms and this could alter marine ecosystems.     climate change acidification ocean acidification   CLIM CLIM043 043,Past trends The annual mean atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 397ppm in 2014, which is 40% above the pre-industrial level (280ppm); half of that increase has occurred since the 1980s. Over the same time period, ocean pH has been reduced from 8.2 to below 8.1, which corresponds to an increase of about 30% in ocean acidity (defined here as the hydrogen ion concentration). This change has occurred at rates ranging between 0.0014 and 0.0024 per year, which is about a hundred times faster than any change in acidity experienced during the last 55million years [i]. The measured reduction in surface pH in the surface mixed layer (depths to 100m) is consistent with that calculated on the basis of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, assuming thermodynamic equilibrium between the ocean surface and the atmosphere [ii]. The northernmost seas, i.e. the Norwegian Sea and the Greenland Sea, have experienced surface water pH reductions of 0.13 and 0.07, respectively, since the 1980s, both of which are larger than the global average [iii]. Figure 1 shows the decline in ocean surface pH over the period 19882014 from a station offshore of Hawaii, for which the longest time series is available [iv]. The changes observed at two other ocean stations suitable for evaluating long-term trends (offshore of the Canary Islands and Bermuda) are very similar [v]. Projections Average surface water pH is projected to decline further to between 8.05 and 7.75 by 2100, depending on future CO2 emissions (Figure 2). Similar declines are also expected for enclosed, coastal seas such as the Baltic Sea [vi]. The largest projected decline represents more than a doubling in acidity [vii]. Surface waters are projected to become seasonally corrosive to aragonite in parts of the Arctic within a decade and in parts of the Southern Ocean within the next three decades in most scenarios. Aragonite is a less stable form of calcium carbonate and under-saturation will become widespread in these regions at atmospheric CO2 levels of 500600ppm [viii]. The waters of the Baltic Sea will also become more acidic before the end of the century [ix]. Such changes affect many marine organisms and could alter marine ecosystems and fisheries. These rapid chemical changes are an added pressure on marine calcifiers and ecosystems of Europes seas. Without substantial reductions in CO2 emissions, recovery from human-induced acidification will require thousands of years for the Earth system to re-establish roughly similar ocean chemical conditions [x] and millions of years for coral reefs to return, based on palaeo-records of natural coral reef extinction events [xi].

"assessment  Glaciers     The vast majority of glaciers in the European glacial regions are in retreat. Glaciers in the European Alps have lost approximately half of their volume since 1900, with clear acceleration since the 1980s.   Glacier retreat is expected to continue in the future. It has been estimated that the volume of European glaciers will decline between 22 and 84 % compared with the current situation by 2100 under a moderate greenhouse gas forcing scenario, and between 38 and 89 % under a high forcing scenario.   Glacier retreat contributed to global sea level rise by about 0.8 mm per year in 20032009. It also affects freshwater supply and run-off regimes, river navigation, irrigation and power generation. Furthermore, it may cause natural hazards and damage to infrastructure.     europe climate change cryosphere mass-balance glaciers     CLIM CLIM007 007,Past trends A general loss of glacier mass since the beginning of the measurements has occurred in all European glacier regions, except some glaciers in Norway (Figure 1). The Alps have lost roughly 50% of their ice mass since 1900 [i]. Norwegian coastal glaciers were expanding and gaining mass up to the end of the 1990s owing to increased winter snowfall on the North Atlantic Coast; now these glaciers are also retreating [ii]. Some ice caps at higher elevations in north-eastern Svalbard, Norway, seem to be increasing in thickness, but estimates for Svalbard as a whole show a declining mass balance [iii]. The centennial retreat of European glaciers is attributed primarily to increased summer temperatures. However, changes in winter precipitation, reduced glacier albedo due to the lack of summer snowfall and various other feedback processes, such as the increasing debris cover on the glacier, can influence the behaviour of glaciers, in particular on regional and decadal scales. The melting of glaciers is contributing significantly to global sea level rise. For the period 20032009, the global contribution was 0.710.08mm per year, accounting for 2913% of the observed sea level rise [iv]. Projections The retreat of European glaciers is projected to continue throughout the 21st century (Figure 2). One study estimates that the volume of European glaciers will decline between 22 and 84% relative to their extent in 2006 under a moderate greenhouse gas forcing scenario (RCP4.5) and between 38 and 89% under a high forcing scenario (RCP8.5) (all European regions combined) [v]. The relative volume loss is largest in central Europe (8310% for RCP4.5 and 954% for RCP8.5). Similar results were achieved in other studies [vi]. In Norway, nearly all smaller glaciers are projected to disappear and, overall, glacier area as well as volume may be reduced by about one-third by 2100, even under the low SRES B2 emissions scenario [vii].

"assessment  Snow cover     Snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere has declined significantly over the past 90 years, with most of the reductions occurring since 1980. Over the period 19672015, snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased by 7 % on average in March and April and by 47 % in June; the observed reductions in Europe are even larger, at 13 % for March and April and 76 % for June.   Snow mass in the Northern Hemisphere is estimated to have decreased by 7 % in March from 1982 to 2009; snow mass in Europe has decreased more rapidly than the average for the Northern Hemisphere, but with large interannual variation.   Model simulations project widespread reductions in the extent and duration of snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere and in Europe over the 21st century.   Changes in snow cover affect the Earths surface reflectivity, water resources, flora and fauna and their ecology, agriculture, forestry, tourism, snow sports, transport and power generation.     climate change cryosphere snow mass snow cover snow cover extent     CLIM CLIM008 008,Past trends Satellite observations of monthly snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere are available from 1967 onwards [i]. A detailed analysis based on multiple sources shows there have been significant decreases in Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent during the spring melt season since about 1980 (March to June; Figure 1, left) [ii]; in other seasons, the snow cover extent has remained stable or even slightly increased. A separate analysis for Europe (EEA-39 region) shows even larger reductions of 13% for March and April, and 76% for June between 1980 and 2015 (Figure 1, right). Decreases in snow cover extent are caused by an earlier onset of melting and a shorter duration of the snow season. Since 1972, the duration of the snow season averaged over the Northern Hemisphere declined by fivedays per decade, but with substantial regional variation. The duration of the snow season has decreased by up to 25days in western, northern and eastern Europe due to earlier spring melt, whereas it has increased by up to 15days in south-eastern Europe due to an earlier onset of the snow season [iii]. The snow mass (i.e. the amount of water that the snow contains) is an important variable, as it affects the role of snow in the hydrological cycle. For the whole of the Northern Hemisphere, a 7% decrease in March snow mass was observed between 1982 and 2009 [iv]. An extension of this data focusing on EEA member countries demonstrates a stronger average decline of 30% for the period 19802015, although the year-to-year variation is large (Figure 2). Winter increases in precipitation have also led to an increase in snow mass at higher altitudes in Norway. Projections Northern Hemisphere snow cover will continue to shrink and snow seasons shorten as temperatures rise [v], although in the coldest regions snowfall can also increase in the middle of winter [vi]. The multi-model mean from the CMIP5 modelling exercise projects changes in March/April snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere during the 21st century ranging from 7% for a low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) to 25% for a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) (Figure 3). The projected snow mass generally follows the snow cover extent with an estimated range of reduction from about 10% for RCP2.6 to about 30% for RCP8.5; projected reductions in the duration of the snow season range from about 10days for RCP2.6 to about 40days for RCP8.5 [vii]. Specific regional studies suggest significant reductions in snow mass in, for example, the Alps in general [viii], Switzerland [ix], the alpine range of Italy [x], the Pyrenees [xi], Norway [xii], the Turkish mountains [xiii] and the Balkan mountains [xiv]. These changes can have dramatic downstream effects as melt water contributes up to 6070% to annual river flows. Despite the projected decrease in long-term mean snow mass in the Northern Hemisphere, model simulations indicate occasional winters of heavy snowfall, but these become increasingly uncommon towards the end of the 21st century.

"assessment  Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets     The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are the largest bodies of ice in the world and play an important role in the global climate system. Both ice sheets have been losing large amounts of ice at an increasing rate since 1992.   The cumulative ice loss from Greenland from 1992 to 2015 was 3 600 Gt and contributed to global sea level rise by approximately 10 mm; the corresponding figure for Antarctica is 1 500 Gt, which corresponds to approximately a 5 mm global sea level rise since 1992.   Model projections suggest further declines of the polar ice sheets in the future, but the uncertainties are large. The melting of the polar ice sheets is estimated to contribute up to 50 cm of global sea level rise during the 21st century. Very long-term projections (until the year 3000) suggest potential sea level rise of several metres with continued melting of the ice sheets.     sea level rise greenland ice sheet cryosphere antarctic ice sheet climate change     CLIM CLIM009 009,Past trends The mass balance of the polar ice sheets is affected by numerous factors, including changes in precipitation patterns over the ice sheets, snowfall, changes in the snowline, summer melting of snow, changes in ice sheet albedo, changes in the extent of supraglacial lakes, submarine melting of the floating ice shelves at the tongue of marine outlet glaciers, and icebergs breaking off of glaciers [i]. The changing balance between ice accumulation, on the one hand, and melting and sublimation of ice and snow, submarine melting and calving, on the other hand, determines the future development of the ice sheets. Both ice sheets have lost significant amounts of ice since 2005 (Figure 1). Several different methods have been used to monitor the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet. The overall conclusion of all available studies is that Greenland is losing mass (Figure 1). Average ice loss increased from 34 (uncertainty interval: 6 to 74) billion tonnes per year over the period 19922001 to 215 (157 to 274) billion tonnes per year over the period 20022011. In 2012, an exceptional loss estimated at more than 500 billion tonnes was recorded. From 1992 to 2012, the contribution to the global sea level has been estimated to have been approximately 8.0mm (6.6 to 9.4mm) [ii]. In 20132015, the net loss of ice was slower than in 2012, with a total of approximately 280 billion tonnes net loss over the period [iii]. In Greenland, the area subject to summer melt has increased significantly over recent decades [iv]. The increased melting has been attributed to changes in general circulation in summer, creating warmer conditions over Greenland [v]. Ice core data suggest that large-scale melting events such as the one observed in 2012 have occurred once every few hundred years on average, with previous ones in 1889 and in the 12th century. It is not currently possible to tell whether the frequency of these rare extensive melt events has changed [vi]. Another important process that may accelerate the loss of ice from the ice sheets is enhanced submarine melting of glaciers terminating in the sea. Its importance may be greater than previously assumed. The process has been documented for both the Greenland and the Antarctic ice sheets [vii]. East Antarctica had a slightly positive mass balance of +14 (29 to +57) billion tonnes per year over the period 19922011, but, overall, the Antarctic ice sheet has lost on average approximately 70 billion tonnes of ice per year, as West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula have lost 65 (39 to 91) and 20 (6 to 34) billion tonnes per year, respectively. The floating ice shelves have also become thinner [viii]. From 1992 to 2015, the ice loss of the Antarctic ice sheet has contributed approximately 5mm (2 to 7mm) to the global sea level [ix]. All in all, the ice sheets have contributed to about one-third of the total sea level rise since the 1990s [x]. A recent study of Antarctica suggests, however, that the snow accumulation has exceeded the mass loss from ice discharge, leading to the equivalent of an annual 0.23mm sea level depletion between 2003 and 2008 [xi]. Projections All recent studies indicate that the mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet will increase the global sea level, with greater radiative forcing leading to greater sea level rise. Recent studies suggest an upper bound of 16cm of sea level rise from the Greenland ice sheet during the 21st century for a high emissions scenario and somewhat lower values for lower emissions scenarios [xii]. One recent study estimated that the Greenland ice sheet contribution until the year 3000 will be 1.4, 2.6 and 4.2m for the emissions scenarios SRES B1, A1B and A2 (with stabilised greenhouse concentrations after 2100), respectively [xiii]. On multi-millennial time scales, the Greenland ice sheet shows threshold behaviour due to different feedback mechanisms. If a temperature above the threshold is maintained for an extended period, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet could self-amplify, which would eventually result in near-complete ice loss (equivalent to a sea level rise of about 7m). Coupled climateice sheet models with a fixed topography (that do not consider the feedback between surface mass balance and the height of the ice sheet) estimate that the global mean surface air temperature threshold above which the Greenland ice will completely melt lies between 2 and 4C above pre-industrial levels [xiv]. In contrast, a study modelling the ice sheet dynamically suggests that the threshold could be as low as about 1C above pre-industrial levels [xv]. The complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet is not inevitable because it has a long time scale. Complete melting would take tens of millennia if near the threshold and a millennium or more for temperatures a few degrees above the threshold [xvi]. The uncertainties around future ice discharge from Antarctica, and the associated sea level rise, are larger than for Greenland. However, mass loss of the Antarctic ice sheet has a greater impact on the sea level in the Northern Hemisphere than a comparable loss of the Greenland ice sheet, owing to gravitational forces. A comprehensive analysis applying various climate, ocean and ice sheet models estimates that the additional ice loss for the 21st century is 7cm (90% range: 023cm) of global sea level equivalent for a low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) and 9cm (90% range: 137cm) for a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) [xvii]. By 2100, the rise of global sea level will be clearly influenced by the development of the Antarctic ice sheet. A recent study suggests that the Antarctic ice sheet has the potential to contribute more than a metre to sea level rise by 2100 and more than 15metres by 2500, if emissions continue unabated [xviii]. Several studies that were published after the release of the IPCCAR5 suggest that melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) has been accelerating recently and that a WAIS collapse is already inevitable and irreversible. There are also indications of instability in some parts of the much larger East Antarctic Ice Sheet. These new results suggest that the global mean sea level contribution from Antarctica alone could be several metres on a time scale of a few centuries to a millennium [xix]. The long-term development of the ice sheets is hugely important in determining the consequences of climate change. Amplifying feedback mechanisms, including slowdown of meridional overturning circulation, may accelerate ice sheet mass loss [xx]. A coupled ice sheetice shelf model suggests that, if atmospheric warming exceeds 1.5 to 2C above present, the major Antarctic ice shelves would collapse, which would trigger a centennial- to millennial-scale response of the Antarctic ice sheet and cause an unstoppable contribution to sea level rise [xxi]. Although current estimates of sea level rise by 2100 suggest that they will fall in a range of some tens of centimetres [xxii], collapsing ice sheets could, in the long term, result in a faster and greater rise in sea level than currently assumed, underlining the urgency of climate change mitigation [xxiii]. The uncertainties in the long-term projections are significant, however. Assumptions concerning, for example, bedrock uplift and sea surface drop associated with ice sheet retreat have a significant effect on the results with respect to sea level rise [xxiv].   [i] J. E.

"assessment  Arctic and Baltic sea ice      The extent and volume of the Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly since global data became available, especially in summer. Over the period 19792015, the Arctic has lost, on average, 42 000 km 2  of sea ice per year in winter and 89 000 km 2  per year by the end of summer.   The nine lowest Arctic sea ice minima since records began in 1979 have been the September ice cover in each of the last nine years (20072015); the record low Arctic sea ice cover in September 2012 was roughly half the average minimum extent of 19812010. The annual maximum ice cover in March 2015 and March 2016 were the lowest on record, and the ice is also getting thinner.   The maximum sea ice extent in the Baltic Sea shows a decreasing trend since about 1800. The decrease appears to have accelerated since the 1980s, but the interannual variability is large.   Arctic sea ice is projected to continue to shrink and thin. For high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in September is likely before mid-century. There will still be substantial ice in winter.   Baltic Sea ice, in particular the extent of the maximal cover, is projected to continue to shrink.     cryosphere climate change arctic sea ice ocean baltic sea sea ice extent northern hemisphere arctic sea ice         CLIM CLIM010 010,Past trends In the period 19792015, the sea ice extent in the Arctic decreased by 42000km2 per year in winter (measured in March) and by 89000km2 per year in summer (measured in September) (Figure 1), which, based on historical records, is likely unprecedented since the 14th century [i]. The maximum sea ice extent in March 2015 and March 2016 were the lowest on record. Arctic sea ice loss is driven by a combination of warmer ocean waters and a warmer atmosphere, including an earlier onset of summer surface melt [ii]. In contrast, Antarctic sea ice has reached record high levels in recent years, but the expansion of the Antarctic sea ice has been less than half of the loss of Arctic sea ice [iii]. Changes in Arctic sea ice may trigger complex feedback processes. Warming and a longer melt season result in increased solar heat uptake by the ocean, which delays the autumn refreeze [iv]. However, a warmer atmosphere means that there are more clouds and, in summer, these reflect sunlight, thus representing a negative feedback mechanism. Even so, some evidence suggests that winter regrowth of ice is inhibited by the warmer ocean surface [v]. Thinner winter ice leads to more heat loss from the ocean and a warmer atmosphere, and hence thicker cloud cover, which inhibits the escape of heat to space [vi], which is a positive feedback mechanism. The minimum Arctic sea ice cover at the end of the melt season in September 2012 broke all previously observed records. All years since 2002 have been below the average for 19812010 (Figure 1). Comparison of recent sea ice coverage with older ship and aircraft observations suggests that summer sea ice coverage may have halved since the 1950s [vii]. Since more reliable satellite observations started in 1979, summer ice has shrunk by 10% per decade [viii]. Between 1979 and 2011, the reduction of sea ice has significantly reduced albedo, corresponding to an additional 6.40.9W/m2 of solar energy input into the Arctic Ocean region since 1979. Averaged over the globe, this albedo decrease corresponds to a forcing that is 25% of that due to the change in CO2 during this period [ix]. The Arctic sea ice is also getting thinner and younger, as less sea ice survives the summer to grow into thicker multi-year floes [x]. A recent analysis has found that annual mean ice thickness has decreased from 3.59m in 1975 to 1.25m in 2012, i.e. a 65% reduction in less than 40 years [xi]. This supports findings from calculations of sea ice volume from satellites and an earlier estimate by the Pan Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS)([1]), which suggests that the mean monthly sea ice volume has decreased by about 3000km3/decade since 1979 [xii]. Information on sea ice extent in the Baltic Sea goes back to 1720. The maximum sea ice extent has displayed a decreasing trend most of the time since about 1800 (Figure 2). The decrease in sea ice extent appears to have accelerated since the 1980s, but large interannual variability makes it difficult to demonstrate this statistically [xiii]. The frequency of mild ice winters, defined as having a maximum ice cover of less than 130000km2, has, however, increased from seven in 30 years in the period 19501979 to 15 in the period 19862015. The frequency of severe ice winters, defined as having a maximum ice cover of at least 270000km2, has decreased from six to four during the same periods. Projections Improving the ability to track the observed rapid summer-time melting of Arctic sea ice has been a challenge for modelling [xiv], but observations fall well within the model range in recent modelling studies [xv]. All model projections agree that Arctic sea ice will continue to shrink and thin. For high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in September is likely to occur before mid-century (Figure 3) [xvi]. An extension beyond 2100 suggests that, for the highest emissions scenario (RCP8.5), the Arctic could become ice-free year-round before the end of the 22nd century; on the other hand, a recovery of Arctic sea ice could become apparent in the 22nd century if stringent policies to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, and eventually concentrations, are successfully implemented [xvii]. Projections of Baltic Sea ice extent under different emissions scenarios suggest that the maximal ice cover and ice thickness will continue to shrink significantly over the 21st century. The best estimate of the decrease in maximum ice extent from a model ensemble is 6400km2/decade for a medium emissions scenario (RCP4.5) and 10900km2/decade for a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5); for the latter scenario, largely ice-free conditions are projected by the end of the century [xviii].

"assessment-6  Persistent organic pollutant emissions     The emissions of a number of compounds categorised as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) decreased between 1990 and 2014 in the EEA-33, e.g. hexachlorobenzene (HCB) by 95 %, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by 71 %, dioxins and furans by 85 % and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by 60 %.   Although the majority of countries report that POP emissions fell during this period, some report that emissions increased.    In 2014, the most significant sources of emissions for these POPs included the Commercial, institutional and households (13 % of HCB, 39 % of dioxins and furans, 54 % of PAHs and 15 % of PCBs) and Industrial processes and product use (16 % of HCB and 51 % of PCBs) sectors.      hcb furans air pollution polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pops pah dioxins air pollution indicators air emissions pcb hch persistent organic pollutants dioxins and furans pollution              APE APE006 006,Important emission sources of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) typically include residential combustion processes (open fires, coal and wood burning for heating purposes, etc.), industrial metal production processes and the road transport sector. Commercial, institutional and households: Current emissions from Commercial, institutional and households sources account for just over half of total PAH emissions and more than one third of the total dioxin and furan emissions for the EEA-33. Emissions from households have declined since 1990 as a result of a decrease in the residential use of coal. Industrial processes and product use: Industrial processes and product use sources account for half of the PCB emissions in the EEA-33, but emissions from this sector have decreased by around 80 % since 1990. Reductions in POP emissions in the 'Industrial processes and product use' sector have resulted from improvements in abatement technologies for metal refining and smelting. Road transport: Road transport emissions do not make particularly large contributions to total POP emissions in the EEA-33. ,   In the EEA-33 region, emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) decreased by 60 % between 1990 and 2014 (Figure 1). A combination of targeted legislation, details of which are set out in the 'Indicator specification  policy context' section, coupled with improved controls and abatement techniques, has led, in general, to significant progress being made in most countries to reduce PAH emissions (Figure 6).   Although the majority of individual countries report that PAH emissions have decreased since 1990, three countries (Denmark, Iceland and Malta) have reported an increase in PAH emissions. Of these countries, emissions in Iceland and Malta have increased by more than 50 % since 1990. One cause of these increased emissions is the introduction of policy measures that have encouraged the burning of renewable materials (e.g. wood by Danish households). Wood burning produces emissions of PAHs and hence, in this instance, policies that have been implemented to address one environmental issue (climate change) have had unintended consequences on another (air pollution). In absolute terms, the emissions of PAHs from these countries are relatively low compared with other countries, but the effect on local populations and environmental quality may, nevertheless, be notable. Of the EEA-33 countries, Germany and Spain report the highest PAH emissions; in these countries, emissions are nearly five times greater than the average reported estimate.   Emissions ofhexachlorobenzene (HCB) have fallen sharply in the EEA-33 since 1990, mostly because of a decrease of 5.6 tonnes in HCB emissions in the United Kingdom between 1998 and 1999, which accounts for 98 % of the decrease in EEA-33 emissions in 1999 (Figure 2). This large decrease was due to the introduction of regulations in the United Kingdom to control the use of hexachloroethane (HCE) tablets as a degassing agent in secondary aluminium production. A total of 61 % of the reduction in HCB emissions across all EEA-33 countries since 1990 can be explained by the fall in HCB emissions in the United Kingdom, from 59 % of EEA-33 emissions in 1990 to just 12 % in 2014.   Emissions of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the EEA-33 decreased by 89 % between 1990 and 2014, mainly because of reductions in 'Industrial processes and product use' emissions, which accounted for 69 % of the decrease over this period (Figure 6). Within the EEA-33 region, five countries have reported emissions of PCBs that are higher than emissions in 1990: Austria, Cyprus,Portugal, Spain and Sweden (Figure 4). In 2014, 23 countries reported lower emissions than in 1990, and the remaining five countries either did not report data or reported zero emissions for 1990.   The reported emissions of dioxins and furans in the EEA-33 countries decreased by 84 % between 1990 and 2014. Of the 31 countries which reported non-zero emissions, only Latvia and Malta reported an increase in emissions between 1990 and 2014 (Figure 5). The overall decrease in emissions across all EEA-33 countries was due to significantly reduced emissions from the 'Energy production and distribution' (28 % of overall decrease), 'Waste' (23 %) and 'Commercial, institutional and households' (22 %) sectors (Figure 6). In 2014, 39 % of dioxin and furan emissions were from sources in the 'Commercial, institutional and households' sector, 16 % were from the 'Energy use in industry' sector and 16 % were from the 'Waste' sector (Figure 6).  "
"assessment-3  Emissions of the main air pollutants in Europe     Anthropogenic emissions of the main air pollutants decreased significantly in most EEA member countries between 1990 and 2014:     emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x ) decreased by 51 % (55 % in the EU-28);   emissions of sulphur oxides (SO x ) decreased by 80 % (88 % in the EU-28);   emissions ofnon-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) decreased by 57 % (60 % in the EU-28);   emissions of ammonia (NH 3 ) decreased by 11 % (24 % in the EU-28);   emissions of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) decreased by 36 % (36 % in the EU-28).     The EU-28 met its continuing obligation to maintain emissions of NO x , SO x , NH 3  and NMVOCs below legally binding targets, as specified by the National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD). A number of EU Member States reported emissions that were above their NECD emission ceilings: three countries(Austria, Ireland and Luxembourg) exceeded emission ceilingsfor NO x , five (Austria, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain)exceeded emission ceilingsfor NH 3 and two (Ireland and Luxembourg)exceeded emission ceilingsfor NMVOCs.There are no emission ceilings for primary PM 2.5 .   Three additional EEA member countries (Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland)had emission ceilings for 2010 that were set in the Gothenburg Protocol under the 1979 United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution. Liechtenstein and Norway reported emissions above their NH 3  ceilings.   Emission reduction commitments for 2020 have been set under the revised Gothenburg Protocol for NO x , SO x , NMVOC, NH 3 and PM 2.5 . The EU-28 as a whole is on track to meet its reduction commitments.     europe trends emissions by sector group main air pollutant emissions    CSI CSI040 APE APE010 040 010,The National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD) and the Gothenburg Protocol under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) set emission ceilings for European countries for sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and ammonia (NH3). The NECD emission ceilings had to be met by 2010 and for the years thereafter. The 2012 amended Gothenburg Protocol sets 2010 and 2020 emission ceilings for these same four pollutants, and it also includes ceilings for primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions for 2020(see Indicator Specification for details). The aim of the NECD and the Gothenburg Protocol is to restrict the emissions of selected air pollutants, including ozone and particulate matter (PM) precursors and pollutants that contribute to ecosystem acidification and eutrophication. Information on the exceedance of air quality standards for the protection of human health, and the exposure of ecosystems to acidification, eutrophication and ozone is available from EEA indicators CSI004 and CSI005, respectively. In 2013, 24 countries reported emissions above their 2020 NOxNECD reduction commitments, 19 reported emissions above their NH3 ceilings, 20 reported emissions above their NMVOCs ceilings, 13reported emissions above their SO2 ceilings and 23 reported emissionsabove their PM2.5 ceilings.  Sulphur oxides In 2014, SOx emissions were approximately 13 % of 1990 levels for the EU-28. Emissions continue to fall, and for the EEA-33 they are just below 20 % of 1990 emission levels. All countries continue to meet their 2010 emission ceiling commitments. Nitrogen oxides NOxemissions for the EEA-33 and the EU-28 continue to fall, and are about half of their 1990 values. These reductions have primarily been due to the introduction of three-way catalytic converters for cars. However, the observed emission reductions from some modern vehicles have not met initial expectations, and actual emissions from vehicles (often termed real-world driving emissions) may exceed the emissions reported during the test-cycle specified by the European emission standards for each vehicle type. Non-methane volatile organic compounds NMVOC emissions for the EEA-33 and the EU-28 have fallen to less than half of their 1990 levels, and nearly all countries have reported emissions below their 2010 emission ceilings. Ammonia NH3 emissions have fallen less than those of the other NECD pollutants. They decreased by approximately 25 % for the EU-28 and 11 % for the EEA-33 (a slight increase from 2013 to 2014)compared with 1990 levels. The majority of countries have reported meeting their 2010 NECDemission ceiling commitments. The NECD does not include a stricter ceiling for environmental objectives, as is the case for the other main air pollutants. Fine particulate matter Emissions of primary PM2.5 have decreased to about a third, for both the EEA-33 and the EU-28, of their 1990 levels. The timeline of emissions reductions shows that the EU-28 as a whole is on track towards achieving the total reduction target set by the Gothenburg Protocol. The country-specific PM2.5 timelines suggest that some countries (approximately one third) are not on track to meet their individual commitments by 2020. These countries may therefore need to implement emission reduction measures beyond those currently in place.,European legal instruments directly and indirectly addressthe mitigation of air pollutant emissions from specific source sectors (for details see Indicator Specification). The newer Member States of the European Union have, in a number of cases, undergone major economic structural changes since the early 1990s, which has led to significant reductions. In many cases, these changes have led to a general decline in some activities that previously contributed significantly to the total emissions of air pollutants (e.g. heavy industry), such as the closure of older, less efficient power plants, etc. Over recent years, there has also been a modernisation of the road vehicle fleet, including the introduction of more vehicles with improved emissions control. Sulphur oxides Emissions of SOx are dominated by emissions from the 'Energy production and distribution' sector, which typically accounts for 60 % of total emissions from the EEA-33. This source is also responsible for the largest reduction in emissions since 1990. Stationary combustion: Substantial SOx emissions reductions have been made across a number of sectors. The three largest sectors ('Energy production and distribution', 'Energy use in industry' and 'Commercial, institutional and households') have all reduced their emissions by more than 75 % since 1990. However, despite these large reductions, the 'Energy production and distribution' sector (encompassing activities such as power and heat generation) still remains the most significant source of SOx in the EEA-33 region, contributing over half of the current total of SOx emissions. Shipping: Across Europe, there has also been an increase in the awareness of the contribution madeby national and international shipping traffic to SOx emissions, particularlythe contribution made to air pollution in nearby urban areas by ships at berth (a more detailed discussion of this issue is contained in the 'Transport and environment reporting mechanism' (TERM) indicator fact sheet TERM03  Transport emissions of air pollutants). Acombination of measures has led to reductions in SOx emissions:  Fuel switching: There have been substantial changes from high-sulphur solid (e.g. coal) and liquid (e.g. heavy fuel oil) fuels to low-sulphur fuels (such as natural gas) for power and heat production purposes within the energy, industry and domestic sectors. Abatement equipment: Where high-sulphur fuels are used, flue gas desulphurisation equipment is now installed in new industrial facilities, and has also been retro-fitted to existing facilities. Improvements in energy efficiency: Improvements in energy efficiency have brought about decreases in the demand for energy, which has reduced associated emissions. Sulphur content of fuel: The implementation of several directives within the EU limiting the sulphur content of transport fuel has also contributed to the decrease.   Nitrogen oxides Emissions from 'Road transport' and 'Non-road transport' combine to account for around half of the current NOx emissionsin the EEA-33. Road transport: Since 1990, there have been considerable reductions in NOx and other ozone precursor pollutants in the road transport sector, despite the general increase in transport activity within this sector over the period. This sector alone has contributed to over 40 % of the totalreduction in NOx emissions. These emissions reductions have primarily been achieved as a result of fitting three-way catalytic converters to petrol-fuelled cars (driven by the legislative European emissions standards).Disparities between trends in NOx emissions and ambient NO2 concentrations (see CSI004) are due in part to the increase in the use of diesel vehicles, and the fact that the real-world emissions performances of modern diesel vehicles have not improved to the extent initially suggested by the test-cycle emissions factors used in emission inventories  however, improvements have been made to many emission inventories for the EU-28 countries in an attempt to address this. The disparities are also due to the increase in the proportion of NOx emitted directly as NO2 (primary NO2) from the exhausts of modern diesel vehicles, as a result of emission control systems that aim to reduce total NOx and particulate matter emissions. Energy production and energy use in industry: Emissions of NOx have also declined in the 'Energy production and distribution' sector, and current emissions are approximately half of those in 1990. Furthermore, there have been substantial reductions in emissions from the Energy use in industry sector. These reductions have been achieved through the implementation of measures such as combustion modification (for example the use of low NOx burners), the introduction of flue-gas abatement techniques and fuel-switching from coal to gas. One of the most common forms of combustion modification is the use of low-NOx burners, which can typically reduce emissions by up to 40 %. Flue gas treatment techniques (such as NOx scrubbers, or selective catalytic reduction (SCR) or selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) techniques) can also be used to remove NOx from flue gases. Emissions of NOx are higher from coal-fired power plants than from gas-fired plants, as coal (unlike gas)contains significant amounts of nitrogen. Shipping: There has been an increase in the focus on the relative contribution made to NOx pollutant emissions by national and international shipping traffic (a more detailed discussion of this issue is available in the TERM indicator fact sheet TERM03  Transport emissions of air pollutants).  Non-methane volatile organic compounds Solvent and product use: The largest source of current NMVOC emissions is the 'Solvent and product use' sector (approximately 50 % of the EEA-33 emissions total). Emissions have been reduced to less than two thirds of 1990 emission levels. Important EU regulatory measures  the Solvent Emissions Directive (1999) and the Paints Directive (2004)  were introduced and have led to reductions in the solvent content of products and emissions from industries using solvents. Road transport and non-road transport: Emissions from the 'Road transport' and 'Non-road transport' sectors combine to contribute approximately 15 % of the total NMVOC emissions. Emissions from the Commercial, institutional and households sector make a similar contribution to the total. Since 1990, a considerable reduction in ozone precursor pollutant emissions (NMVOCs and NOx) has occurred in the road transport sector, despite the general increase in transport activity within this sector over the period. Road transport alone accounts for half of the total NMVOC reductions since 1990. These emissions reductions have primarily been achieved as a result of fitting three-way catalytic converters to petrol-fuelled cars (driven by the legislative European emissions standards).  Ammonia Agriculture: Agriculture dominates emissions of NH3, amounting to 94 % of total emissions in the EEA-33 region. Emissions ariseprimarily from the decomposition of urea in animal wastes and uric acid in poultry wastes. Emissions depend on the animal species, age, weight, diet, housing system, waste management and liquid manure storage techniques. Emissions of NH3 have reduced by approximately 10 % since 1990, as a result of changes in the agriculture sector. These changes include a reduction in livestock numbers (especially cattle), and changes in the handling and management of both organic manure and synthetic fertilisers.  Fine particulate matter Commercial, institutional and households: Emissions from the Commercial, institutional and households sector account for over half of the current primary PM2.5 emissions for the EEA-33 region. Within this sector, emissions are almost exclusively from households (over 95 %). Current emissions are 9 % lower than those in 1990. However, since 2007, emissions have fluctuated  this has been strongly influenced by PM2.5 emissionsfrom wood combustion in the residential sector. Energy production and energy use in industry: These sources account for a combined contribution to current EEA-33 emissions of only approximately 12 %, but they account for nearly half of the emissions reductions since 1990. This reflects several changes in the electricity generating and heavy industrial sectors. Fuel switching away from coal has reduced emissions of PM2.5, and the introduction of abatement equipment, such as electrostatic precipitators, has also significantly reduced the emissions of PM2.5. Road transport: Emissions from road transport account for approximately 13 % of the PM2.5emissions total in the EEA-33 region, but account for one quarter of the reduction in total EEA-33 emissions since 1990. This reflects the improved emissions control technologies that have been introduced, particularly for diesel vehicles.  [i]Emissions from Turkey were not reported."
